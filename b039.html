<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">T</span>he burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by the hand of his messenger. Lay   it  , I pray you, to heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v0391  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 I have loved you, says the Lord. And you° said, Wherein have you loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? says the Lord: yet  <span class="xrefmarker">*</span><span class="xref">        Rom 9. 13.  </span>  I loved Jacob,  <span class="verse" rel="v0391  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 and hated Esau and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit. appointed them for desolation.  </span>  laid waste his borders, and made his heritage as dwellings of the wilderness?  <span class="verse" rel="v0391  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 Because one will say, Idumea has been overthrown, but let us return and rebuild the desolate places; thus says the Lord Almighty, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall be called The borders of wickedness, and, The people against whom the Lord has set himself for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0391  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 And your eyes shall see, and you° shall say, The Lord has been magnified  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. above.  </span>  upon the borders of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0391  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 A son honors   his   father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is my honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? says the Lord Almighty. You° the priests are they that despise my name: yet you° said, Wherein have we despised your name?  <span class="verse" rel="v0391  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 In that you° bring to my altar polluted bread; and you° said, Wherein have you° polluted it? In that you° say, The table of the Lord is polluted, and that which was set thereon you° have despised.  <span class="verse" rel="v0391  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 For if you° bring a blind   victim   for sacrifices,   is it   not evil? and if you° bring the lame or the sick,   is it   not evil? offer it now to your ruler,   and see   if he will receive you, if he will accept your person, says the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0391  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 And now  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit. propitiate.  </span>  entreat the face of your God, and make supplication to him. These things have been done by your hands; shall I accept you? says the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0391  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 Because even among you the doors shall be shut, and   one   will not kindle   the fire of   my altar for nothing, I have no pleasure in you, says the Lord Almighty, and I will not accept a sacrifice at your hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v0391  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 For from the rising of the sun even to the going down   thereof   my name has been glorified among the Gentiles; and in every place incense is offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name is great among the Gentiles, says the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0391  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 But you° profane it, in that you° say, The table of the Lord is polluted, and his meats set thereon are despised.  <span class="verse" rel="v0391  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 And you° said, These   services   are troublesome: therefore I have  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. puffed at them.  </span>  utterly rejected them with scorn, says the Lord Almighty: and you° brought in torn victims, and lame, and sick: if then you° should bring an offering, shall I accept them at your hands? says the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0391  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 And cursed   is the man   who had the power, and possessed a male in his flock, and whose vow is upon him, and who sacrifices a corrupt thing to the Lord: for I am a great King, says the Lord Almighty, and my name is glorious among the nations.  
<!-- 2   014 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> And now, O priests, this commandment is to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0392  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 If you° will not listen, and if you° will not lay   it   to heart, to give glory to my name, says the Lord Almighty, then I will send forth the curse upon you, and I will bring a curse upon your blessing: yes, I will curse it, and I will scatter your blessing, and it shall not exist among you, because you° lay not this to heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v0392  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 Behold,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. separate the shoulder from you.  </span>  I turn my back upon you, and I will scatter dung upon your faces, the dung of your feasts, and I will carry you away at the same time.  <span class="verse" rel="v0392  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 And you° shall know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant might be with the sons of Levi, says the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0392  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 My covenant of life and peace was with him, and I gave  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, power, or, charge to fear me, etc.  </span>    it   him that he might reverently fear me, and that he might  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See 2 Cor 8. 20.  </span>  be awe-struck at my name.  <span class="verse" rel="v0392  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked before me directing   his way   in peace, and he turned many from unrighteousness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0392  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 For the priest's lips  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. shall.  </span>  should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0392  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 But you° have turned aside from the way, and caused many to fail in   following   the law: you° have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0392  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 And I have made you despised and cast out among all the people, because you° have not kept my ways, but have  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. accepted persons.  </span>  been partial in the law.  <span class="verse" rel="v0392  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 Have you° not all one father? Did not one God create you? why have you° forsaken every man his brother, to profane the covenant of your fathers?  <span class="verse" rel="v0392  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 Juda has been forsaken, and an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Juda has profaned the holy things of the Lord, which he delighted in, and has gone after other gods.  <span class="verse" rel="v0392  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 The Lord will utterly destroy the man that does these things, until he be even cast down from out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and from among them that offer sacrifice to the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0392  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 And these things which I hated, you° did: you° covered with tears the altar of the Lord, and with weeping and groaning because of troubles:   is it   meet   for me   to have respect to your sacrifice, or to receive   anything   from your hands   as   welcome?  <span class="verse" rel="v0392  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 Yet you° said, Therefore? Because the Lord has borne witness between you and the wife of your youth, whom you have forsaken, and   yet   she was your partner, and the wife of your covenant.  <span class="verse" rel="v0392  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 And did he not do well? and   there was   the residue of his spirit. But you° said, What does God seek but a seed? But take you° heed to your spirit, and forsake not the wife of your youth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0392  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 But if you should hate   your wife   and put her away, says the Lord God of Israel, then ungodliness shall cover your thoughts, says the Lord Almighty: therefore take you° heed to your spirit, and forsake   them   not,  <span class="verse" rel="v0392  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 you° that have provoked God with your words. But you° said, Wherein have we provoked him? In that you° say, Every one that does evil is a pleasing   object   in the sight of the Lord, and he takes pleasure in such;  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, and, Where, etc.  </span>  and where is the God of justice?

<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span>   <span class="xrefmarker">*</span><span class="xref">        Mat 11. 10.  </span>  Behold, I send forth my messenger, and he shall survey the way before me: and the Lord, whom you° seek, shall suddenly come into his temple, even the angel of the covenant, whom you° take pleasure in: behold, he is coming, says the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0393  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 And who will  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, wait for.  </span>  abide the day of his coming? or who will withstand at his appearing? for he is coming in as the fire of a furnace and as the herb of  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. them that wash.  </span>  fullers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0393  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 He shall sit to melt and purify as it were silver, and as it were gold: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. pour.  </span>  refine them as gold and silver, and they shall offer to the Lord an offering in righteousness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0393  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 And the sacrifice of Juda and Jerusalem shall be pleasing to the Lord, according to the former days, and according to the former years.  <span class="verse" rel="v0393  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 And I will draw near to you in judgment; and I will be a sift witness against the witches, and against the adulteresses, and against them that swear falsely by my name, and against them that keep back the hireling's wages, and them that oppress the widow, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. beat with the fist.  </span>  afflict orphans, and that wrest the judgment of the stranger, and fear not me, says the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0393  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 For I am the Lord your God, and I am not changed:  <span class="verse" rel="v0393  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 but you°, the sons of Jacob, have not refrained from the iniquities of your fathers: you° have perverted my statutes, and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, says the Lord Almighty. But you° said, Wherein shall we return?  <span class="verse" rel="v0393  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 Will a man insult God? for you° insult me. But you° say, Wherein have we insulted you? In that the tithes and first fruits are with you   still  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0393  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 And you° do surely look off from me, and you° insult me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0393  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 The year is completed, and you° have brought all the produce into the storehouses; but there shall be the plunder thereof in its house: return now on this behalf, says the Lord Almighty,   see   if I will not open to you the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, windows, see Gen 7. 11, there rendered 'flood-gates.'  </span>  torrents of heaven, and pour out my blessing upon you, until you° are satisfied.  <span class="verse" rel="v0393  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 And I will  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, give a charge for you to be fed. Alex.  </span>  appoint food for you, and I will not destroy the fruit of your land; and your vine in the field shall not fail, says the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0393  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 And all nations shall call you blessed: for you° shall be a desirable land, says the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0393  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 You° have spoken grievous words against me, says the Lord. Yet you° said, Wherein have we spoken against you?  <span class="verse" rel="v0393  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 You° said, He that serves God  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. is vain.  </span>  labors in vain: and what have we gained in that we have kept his ordinances, and in that we have walked as suppliants before the face of the Lord Almighty?  <span class="verse" rel="v0393  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 And now we pronounce strangers blessed; and all they who act unlawfully are built up; and they have resisted God, and   yet   have been delivered.  <span class="verse" rel="v0393  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 Thus spoke they that feared the Lord, every one to his neighbor: and the Lord gave heed, and listened, and he wrote a book of remembrance before him for them that feared the Lord and reverenced his name.  <span class="verse" rel="v0393  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 And they shall be  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. for me.  </span>  mine, says the Lord Almighty, in the day which I appoint for a peculiar possession; and I will make choice of them, as a man makes choice of his son that serves him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0393  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 Then shall you° return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, and between him that serves God, and him that serves   him   not.

 But to you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise, and healing   shall be   in his wings: and you° shall go forth, and bound as young calves let loose from bonds.  <span class="verse" rel="v0394  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
