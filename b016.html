<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">T</span>he words of Neemias the son of Chelcia. And it came to pass in the month Chaseleu, of the twentieth year, that I was in Susan the palace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0161  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 And Anani, one of my brethren, came, he and   some   men of Juda; and I asked them concerning those that had escaped, who had been left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0161  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 And they said to me, The remnant,   even   those that are left of the captivity,   are   there in the land, in great distress and reproach: and the walls of Jerusalem   are   thrown down, and its gates are burnt with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v0161  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And it came to pass, when I heard these words,   that   I sat down and wept, and mourned for   several   days, and continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven.  <span class="verse" rel="v0161  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 And I said, Nay, I pray you, O Lord God of heaven, the mighty, the great and terrible, keeping your covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to those that keep his commandments:  <span class="verse" rel="v0161  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 let now your ear be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may hear the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you at this time, this day   both   day and night, for the children of Israel your servants, and make confession for the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against you: both I and the house of my father have sinned.  <span class="verse" rel="v0161  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 We have altogether broken   covenant   with you, and we have not kept the commandments, and the ordinances, and the judgments, which you did command your servant Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0161  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 Remember, I pray you, the word wherewith you did charge your servant Moses, saying, If you° break covenant   with me  , I will disperse you among the nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0161  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 But if you° turn again to me, and keep my commandments, and do them; if you° should be scattered under the utmost   bound   of heaven, thence will I gather them, and I will bring them into the place which I have chosen to cause my name to dwell there.  <span class="verse" rel="v0161  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 Now they   are   your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed with your great power, and with your strong hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0161  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
    Turn   not   away  , I pray you, O Lord, but let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who desire to fear your name: and prosper, I pray you, your servant this day, and cause him to find mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was the king's cupbearer.  
<!-- 2   011 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> And it came to pass in the month Nisan of the twentieth year of king Arthasastha, that the wine was before me: and I took the wine, and gave   it   to the king: and there was not another before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0162  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 And the king said to me, Why is your countenance sad, and do you not control yourself? and now this is nothing but sorrow of heart. Then I was very much alarmed,  <span class="verse" rel="v0162  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 and I said to the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be said, forasmuch as the city, even the home of the sepulchres of my fathers, has been laid waste, and her gates have been devoured with fire?  <span class="verse" rel="v0162  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 And the king said to me, For what do you ask thus? So I prayed to the God of heaven.  <span class="verse" rel="v0162  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 And I said to the king, If   it seem   good to the king, and if your servant shall have found favor in your sight,   I ask   that   you   would send him into Juda, to the city of the sepulchres of my fathers; then will I rebuild it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0162  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 And the king, and his concubine that sat next to him, said to me, For how long will your journey be, and when will you return? and   the proposal   was pleasing before the king, and he sent me away, and I appointed him a time.  <span class="verse" rel="v0162  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 And I said to the king, If   it seem   good to the king, let him give me letters to the governors beyond the river, so as to forward me till I come to Juda;  <span class="verse" rel="v0162  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the garden which belongs to the king, that he may give me timber to cover the gates, and for the wall of the city, and for the house into which I shall enter. And the king gave to me, according as the good hand of God   was upon me  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0162  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 And I came to the governors beyond the river, and I gave them the king's letters. (Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.)  <span class="verse" rel="v0162  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 And Sanaballat the Aronite heard   it  , and Tobia the servant, the Ammonite, and it was grievous to them that a man was come to seek good for the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0162  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.  <span class="verse" rel="v0162  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 And I rose up by night, I and a few men with me; and I told no man what God put into my heart to do with Israel; and there was no beast with me, except the beast which I rode upon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0162  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 And I went forth by the gate of the valley by night, and to the mouth of the well of fig trees, and to the dung-gate: and I mourned over the wall of Jerusalem which they were destroying, and her gates were devoured with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v0162  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 And I passed on to the fountain gate, and to the king's pool; and there was no room for the beast to pass under me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0162  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 And I went up by the wall of the brook by night, and mourned over the wall, and passed through the gate of the valley, and returned.  <span class="verse" rel="v0162  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 And the sentinels knew not why I went, nor what I was doing; and until that time I told   it   not to the Jews, or to the priests, or to the nobles, or to the captains, or to the rest   of the men   who wrought the works.  <span class="verse" rel="v0162  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 Then I said to them, You° see this evil, in which we are, how Jerusalem is desolate, and her gates have been set on fire: come, and let us build throughout the wall of Jerusalem, and we shall be no longer a reproach.  <span class="verse" rel="v0162  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 And I told them of the hand of God which was good upon me, also about the words of the king which he spoke to me: and I said, Let us arise and build. And their hands were strengthened for the good   work  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0162  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 And Sanaballat the Aronite, and Tobia the servant, the Ammonite, and Gesam the Arabian, heard   it  , and they laughed us to scorn, and came to us, and said, What   is   this thing that you° are doing? are you° revolting against the king?  <span class="verse" rel="v0162  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 And I answered them, and said to them, The God of heaven, he shall prosper us, and we his servants are pure, and we will build: but you° have no part, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.

<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> Now it came to pass, when Sanaballat heard that we were building the wall, that it was grievous to him, and he was very angry, and railed against the Jews.  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 And he said before his brethren (that   is   the army of the Samaritans)   Is it true   that these Jews are building their city? do they indeed offer sacrifices? will they prevail? and will they this day restore the stones, after they have been burnt and made a heap of rubbish?  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 And Tobias the Ammanite came near to him, and said to them, Do they sacrifice or eat in their place? shall not a fox go up and pull down their wall of stones?  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 Hear, O our God, for we have become a scorn; and return you their reproach upon their head, and make them a scorn in a land of captivity,  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  5-6" id="4  5-6" >5-6</span>
 and do not cover   their   iniquity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 But it came to pass, when Sanaballat and Tobia, and the Arabians, and the Ammanites, heard that the building of the walls of Jerusalem was advancing,   and   that the breaches began to be stopped, that it appeared very grievous to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 And all of them assembled together, to come to fight against Jerusalem, and to destroy it utterly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 So we prayed to our God and set watchmen against them day and night, because of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 And Juda said, The strength of the enemies is broken, yet   there is   much rubbish, and we shall not be able to build the wall.  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 And they that afflicted us said, They shall not know, and they shall not see, until we come into the midst of them, and kill them, and cause the work to cease.  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 And it came to pass, when the Jews who lived near them came, that they said to us, They are coming up against us from every quarter.  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 So I set   men   in the lowest part of the place behind the wall in the lurking-places, I even set the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows.  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  014" id="4  014" >14</span>
 And I looked, and arose, and said to the nobles, and to the captains, and to the rest of the people, Be not afraid of them: remember our great and terrible God, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  015" id="4  015" >15</span>
 And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was made known to us, and God had frustrated their counsel, that we all returned to the wall,   every   man to his work.  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  016" id="4  016" >16</span>
 And it came to pass from that day   that   half of them that had been driven forth, wrought the work, and half of them kept guard; and   there were   spears, and shields, and bows, and breastplates, and rulers behind the whole house of Juda,  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  017" id="4  017" >17</span>
 even of them that were building the wall:—and those who carried the burdens   were   under arms:   each   with one hand wrought his work, and with the other held his dart.  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  018" id="4  018" >18</span>
 And the builders   wrought   each man having his sword girded upon his loins, and so they built: and the trumpeter with his trumpet next to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  019" id="4  019" >19</span>
 And I said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work   is   great and abundant, and we are dispersed upon the wall, each at a great distance from his brother.  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  020" id="4  020" >20</span>
 In whatever place you° shall hear the sound of the cornet, there gather yourselves together to us; and our God shall fight for us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  021" id="4  021" >21</span>
 So we   continued   laboring at the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared.  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  022" id="4  022" >22</span>
 And at that time I said to the people, Lodge you° every man with his servant in the midst of Jerusalem, and let the night be a watch-time to you, and the day a work-time.  <span class="verse" rel="v0164  023" id="4  023" >23</span>
 And I was   there  , and the watchmen behind me, and there was not a man of us that put off his garments.

<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> And the cry of the people and their wives   was   great against their brethren the Jews.  <span class="verse" rel="v0165  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 And some said, We   are   numerous with our sons and our daughters; so we will take corn, and eat, and live.  <span class="verse" rel="v0165  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 And some said,   As to   our fields and vineyards and houses, let us pledge   them  , and we will take corn, and eat.  <span class="verse" rel="v0165  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 And some said, We have borrowed money for the king's tributes:—our fields, and our vineyards, and houses   are pledged  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0165  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 And now our flesh   is   as the flesh of our brethren, our children   are   as their children: yet, behold, we are reducing our sons and our daughters to slavery, and some of our daughters are enslaved: and there is no power of our hands, for our fields and our vineyards   belong   to the nobles.  <span class="verse" rel="v0165  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 And I was much grieved as I heard their cry and these words.  <span class="verse" rel="v0165  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 And my heart took counsel within me, and I contended against the nobles, and the princes, and I said to them, Should every man demand of his brother what you° demand? And I appointed against them a great assembly,  <span class="verse" rel="v0165  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 and I said to them, We of our free-will have redeemed our brethren the Jews that were sold to the Gentiles; and do you° sell your brethren? and shall they be delivered to us? And they were silent, and found no answer.  <span class="verse" rel="v0165  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 And I said, The thing which you° do   is   not good; you° will not so walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the Gentiles our enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0165  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 Both my brethren, and my acquaintances, and I, have lent them money and corn: let us now leave off this exaction.  <span class="verse" rel="v0165  011" id="5  011" >11</span>
 Restore to them, I pray, as at this day, their fields, and their vineyards, and their olive yards, and their houses, and bring forth to them corn and wine and oil of the money.  <span class="verse" rel="v0165  012" id="5  012" >12</span>
 And they said, We will restore, and we will not exact of them; we will do thus as you say. Then I called the priests, and bound them by oath to do according to this word.  <span class="verse" rel="v0165  013" id="5  013" >13</span>
 And I shook out my garment, and said, So may God shake out every man who shall not keep to this word, from his house, and from his labors, he shall be even thus shaken out, as an outcast and empty. And all the congregation said, Amen, and they praised the Lord: and the people did this thing.  <span class="verse" rel="v0165  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 From the day that he charged me to be their ruler in the land of Juda, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Arthasastha, twelve years, I and my brethren ate not   provision   extorted from them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0165  015" id="5  015" >15</span>
 But as for the former acts of extortion wherein   those who were   before me oppressed them, they even took of them their last money, forty didrachmas for bread and wine; and the   very   outcasts of them exercised authority over the people: but I did not so, because of the fear of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0165  016" id="5  016" >16</span>
 Also in the work of the wall I treated them not with rigor, I bought not land: and all that were gathered together   came   there to the work.  <span class="verse" rel="v0165  017" id="5  017" >17</span>
 And the Jews, to   the number of   a hundred and fifty men, besides those coming to us from the nations round about,   were   at my table.  <span class="verse" rel="v0165  018" id="5  018" >18</span>
 And there came   to me   for one day one calf, and I had six choice sheep and a goat; and every ten days wine in abundance of all sorts: yet with these I required not the bread of extortion, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0165  019" id="5  019" >19</span>
 Remember me, O God, for good,   in   all that I have done to this people.  
<!-- 6   019 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="6  001">6  </span> Now it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and Gesam the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and   that   there was no opening left therein; (  but   hitherto I had not set up the doors on the gates;)  <span class="verse" rel="v0166  002" id="6  002" >2</span>
 that Sanaballat and Gesam sent to me, saying, Come and let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono. But they   were   plotting to do me mischief.  <span class="verse" rel="v0166  003" id="6  003" >3</span>
 So I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, and I shall not be able to come down, lest the work should cease: as soon as I shall have finished it, I will come down to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0166  004" id="6  004" >4</span>
 And they sent to me   again   to this effect; and I sent them   word   accordingly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0166  005" id="6  005" >5</span>
 Then Sanaballat sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0166  006" id="6  006" >6</span>
 And in it was written, It has been reported among the Gentiles that you and the Jews are planning to revolt: therefore you are building the wall, and you will be a king to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0166  007" id="6  007" >7</span>
 And moreover you have appointed prophets to yourself, that you might dwell in Jerusalem as a king over Juda: and now these words will be reported to the king. Now then, come, let us take counsel together.  <span class="verse" rel="v0166  008" id="6  008" >8</span>
 And I sent to him, saying, It has not happened according to these words,   even   as you say, for you frame them falsely out of your heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v0166  009" id="6  009" >9</span>
 For all were trying to alarm us, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from this work, and it shall not be done. Now therefore I have strengthened my hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v0166  010" id="6  010" >10</span>
 And I came into the house of Semei the son of Dalaia the Son of Metabeel, and he was shut up; and he said, Let us assemble together in the house of God, in the midst of it, and let us shut the doors of it; for they are coming by night to kill you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0166  011" id="6  011" >11</span>
 And I said, Who is the man that shall enter into the house, that he may live?  <span class="verse" rel="v0166  012" id="6  012" >12</span>
 And I observed, and, behold, God had not sent him, for the prophecy was a fable   devised   against me:  <span class="verse" rel="v0166  013" id="6  013" >13</span>
 and Tobias and Sanaballat had hired against me a multitude, that I might be frightened, and do this, and sin, and become to them an ill name, that they might reproach me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0166  014" id="6  014" >14</span>
 Remember, O God, Tobias and Sanaballat, according to these their deeds, and the prophetess Noadia, and the rest of the prophets who tried to alarm me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0166  015" id="6  015" >15</span>
 So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the   month   Elul, in fifty-two days.  <span class="verse" rel="v0166  016" id="6  016" >16</span>
 And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard   of it  , that all the nations round about us feared, and great alarm fell upon them, and they knew that it was of our God that this work should be finished.  <span class="verse" rel="v0166  017" id="6  017" >17</span>
 And in those days letters came to Tobias from many nobles of Juda, and those of Tobias came to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0166  018" id="6  018" >18</span>
 For many in Juda were bound to him by oath, because he was son-in-law of Sechenias the son of Herae; and Jonan his son had taken the daughter of Mesulam the son of Barachia to wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v0166  019" id="6  019" >19</span>
 And they reported his words to me, and carried out my words to him: and Tobias sent letters to terrify me.

<p><span class="chapter" id="7  001">7  </span> And it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,  <span class="verse" rel="v0167  002" id="7  002" >2</span>
 that I gave charge to Ananias my brother, and Ananias the ruler of the palace, over Jerusalem: for he was a true man, and one that feared God beyond many.  <span class="verse" rel="v0167  003" id="7  003" >3</span>
 And I said to them, The gates of Jerusalem shall not be opened till sunrise; and while they are still watching, let the doors be shut, and bolted; and set watches of them that dwell in Jerusalem,   every   man at his post, and   every   man over against his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0167  004" id="7  004" >4</span>
 Now the city   was   wide and large; and the people   were   few in it, and the houses were not built.  <span class="verse" rel="v0167  005" id="7  005" >5</span>
 And God put   it   into my heart, and I gathered the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, into companies: and I found a register of the company that came up first, and I found written in it as follows:  <span class="verse" rel="v0167  006" id="7  006" >6</span>

 And the Athersastha said, that they should not eat of the most holy things, until a priest should stand up to give light.  <span class="verse" rel="v0167  066" id="7  066" >66</span>
 And all the congregation was about forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty,  <span class="verse" rel="v0167  67-68" id="7  67-68" >67-68</span>
 besides their menservants and their maidservants: these were seven thousand three hundred and thirty seven: and the singing-men and singing-women, two hundred and forty-five.  <span class="verse" rel="v0167  069" id="7  069" >69</span>
 Two thousand seven hundred asses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0167  070" id="7  070" >70</span>
 And part of the heads of families gave into the treasury to Neemias for the work a thousand pieces of gold, fifty bowls, and thirty priests'   garments  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0167  071" id="7  071" >71</span>
 And   some   of the heads of families gave into the treasuries of the work, twenty thousand pieces of gold, and two thousand three hundred pounds of silver.  <span class="verse" rel="v0167  072" id="7  072" >72</span>
 And the rest of the people gave twenty thousand pieces of gold, and two thousand two hundred pounds of silver, and sixty-seven priests'   garments  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0167  073" id="7  073" >73</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> And the seventh month arrived, and the children of Israel   were settled   in their cities; and all the people were gathered as one man to the broad place before the water-gate, and they told Esdras the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the Lord commanded Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0168  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 So Esdras the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and every one who had understanding   was present   to listen, on the first day of the seventh month.  <span class="verse" rel="v0168  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 And he read in it from the time of sunrise to the middle of the day, before the men and the women; and they understood   it  , and the ears of all the people   were attentive   to the book of the law.  <span class="verse" rel="v0168  004" id="8  004" >4</span>
 And Esdras the scribe stood on a wooden stage, and there stood next to him Mattathias, and Samaeas, and Ananias, and Urias, and Chelcia, and Massia, on his right hand; and on his left Phadaeas, and Misael, and Melchias, and Asom, and Asabadma, and Zacharias, and Mesollam.  <span class="verse" rel="v0168  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 And Esdras opened the book before all the people, for he was above the people; and it came to pass when he had opened it,   that   all the people stood.  <span class="verse" rel="v0168  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 And Esdras blessed the Lord, the great God: and all the people answered, and said, Amen, lifting up their hands: and they bowed down and worshipped the Lord with their face to the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v0168  007" id="8  007" >7</span>
 And Jesus and Banaias and Sarabias instructed the people in the law, and the people   stood   in their place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0168  008" id="8  008" >8</span>
 And they read in the book of the law of God, and Esdras taught, and instructed them distinctly in the knowledge of the Lord, and the people understood   the law   in the reading.  <span class="verse" rel="v0168  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 And Neemias, and Esdras the priest and scribe, and the Levites, and they that instructed the people, spoke and said to all the people, It is a holy day to the Lord our God; do not mourn, nor weep. For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law.  <span class="verse" rel="v0168  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 And   the governor   said to them, Go, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to them that have nothing; for the day is holy to our Lord: and faint not, for the Lord is our strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v0168  011" id="8  011" >11</span>
 And the Levites caused all the people to be silent, saying, Be silent, for   it is   a holy day, and despond not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0168  012" id="8  012" >12</span>
 So all the people departed to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, for they understood the words which he made known to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0168  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 And on the second day the heads of families assembled with all the people,   also   the priests and Levites, to Esdras the scribe, to attend to all the words of the law.  <span class="verse" rel="v0168  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 And they found written in the law which the Lord commanded Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths, in the feast in the seventh month:  <span class="verse" rel="v0168  015" id="8  015" >15</span>
 and that they should sound with trumpets in all their cities, and in Jerusalem. And Esdras said, Go forth to the mountain, and bring branches of olive, and branches of cypress trees, and branches of myrtle, and branches of palm trees, and branches of   every   thick tree, to make booths, according to that which was written.  <span class="verse" rel="v0168  016" id="8  016" >16</span>
 And the people went forth, and brought   them  , and made booths for themselves, each one upon his roof, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the streets of the city, and as far as the gate of Ephraim.  <span class="verse" rel="v0168  017" id="8  017" >17</span>
 And all the congregation who had returned from the captivity, made booths, and lived in booths: for the children of Israel   had   not done so from the days of Jesus the son of Naue until that day: and there was great joy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0168  018" id="8  018" >18</span>
 And   Esdras   read in the book of the law of God daily, from the first day even to the last day: and they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance.  
<!-- 9   018 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="9  001">9  </span> Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel assembled with fasting, and in sackcloths, and with ashes on their head.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  002" id="9  002" >2</span>
 And the children of Israel separated themselves from every stranger, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  003" id="9  003" >3</span>
 And they stood in their place, and read in the book of the law of the Lord their god: and they confessed   their sins   to the Lord, and worshipped the Lord their God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  004" id="9  004" >4</span>
    And   there stood upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jesus, and the sons of Cadmiel, Sechenia the son of Sarabia, sons of Choneni; and they cried with a loud voice to the Lord their God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  005" id="9  005" >5</span>
 And the Levites, Jesus and Cadmiel, said, Rise up, bless the Lord our God forever and ever: and let them bless your glorious name, and exalt it with all blessing and praise.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
 And Esdras said, You are the only true Lord; you made the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, and all their array, the earth, and all things that are in it, the seas, and all things in them; and you quicken all things, and the hosts of heaven worship you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 You are the Lord God, you did choose Abram, and brought him out of the land of the Chaldeans, and gave him the name of Abraam:  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 and you found his heart faithful before you, and did make a covenant with him to give to him and to his seed the land of the Chananites, and the Chettites, and Amorites, and Pherezites, and Jebusites, and Gergesites; and you have confirmed your words, for you   are   righteous.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 And you saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and you heard their cry at the Red Sea.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  010" id="9  010" >10</span>
 And you showed signs and wonders in Egypt, on Pharao and all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for you know that they behaved insolently against them: and you made yourself a name, as at this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  011" id="9  011" >11</span>
 And you did cleave the sea before them, and they passed through the midst of the sea on dry land; and you did cast into the deep them that were about to pursue them, as a stone in the mighty water.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  012" id="9  012" >12</span>
 And you guided them by day by a pillar of cloud, and by night by a pillar of fire, to enlighten for them the way wherein they should walk.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  013" id="9  013" >13</span>
 Also you came down upon mount Sina, and you spoke to them out of heaven, and gave them right judgments, and laws of truth, ordinances, and good commandments.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  014" id="9  014" >14</span>
 And you did make known to them your holy sabbath; you did enjoin upon them commandments, and ordinances, and a law, by the hand of your servant Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  015" id="9  015" >15</span>
 And you gave them bread from heaven for their food, and you brought them forth water from a rock for their thirst; and you bade them go in to inherit the land over which you stretched out your hand to give   it   them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  016" id="9  016" >16</span>
 But they and our fathers behaved proudly, and hardened their neck, and did not listen to your commandments,  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  017" id="9  017" >17</span>
 and refused to listen, and remembered not your wonders which you wrought with them; and they hardened their neck, and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt: but you, O God,   are   merciful and compassionate, longsuffering, and abundant in mercy, and you did not forsake them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  018" id="9  018" >18</span>
 And still farther they even made to themselves a molten calf, and said, These   are   the gods that brought us up out of Egypt: and they wrought great provocations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  019" id="9  019" >19</span>
 Yet you in your great compassions did not forsake them in the wilderness: you did not turn away from them the pillar of the cloud by day, to guide them in the way, nor the pillar of fire by night, to enlighten for them the way wherein they should walk.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  020" id="9  020" >20</span>
 And you gave your good Spirit to instruct them, and you did not withhold your manna from their mouth, and gave them water in their thirst.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  021" id="9  021" >21</span>
 And you did sustain them forty years in the wilderness; you did not allow anything to fail them: their garments did not wax old, and their feet were not bruised.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  022" id="9  022" >22</span>
 Moreover, you gave them kingdoms, and did divide nations to them: and they inherited the land of Seon king of Esebon, and the land of Og king of Basan.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  023" id="9  023" >23</span>
 And you did multiply their children as the stars of heaven, and brought them into the land of which you spoke to their fathers;  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  024" id="9  024" >24</span>
 And they inherited it: and you did destroy from before them the dwellers in the land of the Chananites, and you gave into their hands them and their kings, and the nations of the land, to do to them as it pleased them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  025" id="9  025" >25</span>
 And they took lofty cities, and inherited houses full of all good things, wells dug, vineyards, and olive yards, and every fruit tree in abundance: so they ate, and were filled, and grew fat, and rioted in your great goodness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  026" id="9  026" >26</span>
 But they turned, and revolted from you, and cast your law behind their backs; and they killed your prophets, who testified against them to turn them back to you, and they wrought great provocations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  027" id="9  027" >27</span>
 Then you gave them into the hand of them that afflicted them, and they did afflict them: and they cried to you in the time of their affliction, and you did hear them from your heaven, and in your great compassions gave them deliverers, and did save them from the hand of them that afflicted them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  028" id="9  028" >28</span>
 But when they rested, they did evil again before you: so you left them in the hands of their enemies, and they ruled over them: and they cried again to you, and you heard   them   from heaven, and did deliver them in your great compassions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  029" id="9  029" >29</span>
 And you did testify against them, to bring them back to your law: but they listened not, but sinned against your commandments and your judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them; and they turned their back, and hardened their neck, and heard not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  030" id="9  030" >30</span>
 Yet you did bear long with them many years, and did testify to them by your Spirit by the hand of your prophets: but they listened not; so you gave them into the hand of the nations of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  031" id="9  031" >31</span>
 But you in your many mercies did not appoint them to destruction, and did not forsake them; for you are strong, and merciful, and pitiful.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  032" id="9  032" >32</span>
 And now, O our God, the powerful, the great, the mighty, and the terrible, keeping your covenant and your mercy, let not all the trouble seem little in your sight which has come upon us, and our kings, and our princes, and our priests, and our prophets, and our fathers, and upon all your people, from the days of the kings of Assur even to this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  033" id="9  033" >33</span>
 But you   are   righteous in all the things that come upon us; for you have wrought faithfully, but we have greatly sinned.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  034" id="9  034" >34</span>
 And our kings, and our princes, and our priests, and our fathers, have not performed your law, and have not given heed to your commandments, and   have not kept   your testimonies which you did testify to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  035" id="9  035" >35</span>
 And they did not serve you in your kingdom, and in your great goodness which you gave to them, and in the large and fat land which you did furnish before them, and they turned not from their evil devices.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  036" id="9  036" >36</span>
 Behold, we are servants this day, and   as for   the land which you gave to our fathers to eat the fruit of it and the good things of it, behold, we are servants upon it:  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  037" id="9  037" >37</span>
 and its produce   is   abundant for the kings whom you did appoint over us because of our sins; and they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, as it pleases them, and we are in great affliction.  <span class="verse" rel="v0169  038" id="9  038" >38</span>
 And in regard to all these circumstances we make a covenant, and write   it  , and our princes, our Levites,   and   our priests, set their seal to   it  .

 All the sons of Phares who lived in Jerusalem   were   four hundred and sixty-eight men of might.  <span class="verse" rel="v01611  007" id="11  007" >7</span>
 And these   were   the children of Benjamin; Selo son of Mesulam, son of Joad, son of Phadaia, son of Coleia, son of Maasias, son of Ethiel, son of Jesia.  <span class="verse" rel="v01611  008" id="11  008" >8</span>
 And after him Gebe, Seli, nine hundred and twenty-eight.  <span class="verse" rel="v01611  009" id="11  009" >9</span>
 And Joel son of Zechri   was   overseer over them: and Juda son of Asana was second in the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v01611  010" id="11  010" >10</span>

 Saraia, son of Elchia, son of Mesulam, son of Sadduc, son of Marioth, son of Aetoth, was over the house of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01611  012" id="11  012" >12</span>
 And their brethren doing the work of the house were eight hundred and twenty-two: and Adaia son of Jeroam, son of Phalalia, son of Amasi, son of Zacharia, son of Phassur, son of Melchia,  <span class="verse" rel="v01611  013" id="11  013" >13</span>

 and his brethren, mighty men of war, a hundred and twenty-eight: and   their   overseer   was   Badiel son of   one of the   great men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01611  15-16" id="11  15-16" >15-16</span>
 And of the Levites; Samaia, son of Esricam,  <span class="verse" rel="v01611  017" id="11  017" >17</span>
 Matthanias son of Micha, and Jobeb son of Samui,  <span class="verse" rel="v01611  018" id="11  018" >18</span>

 And the porters; Acub, Telamin, and their brethren, a hundred and seventy-two.  <span class="verse" rel="v01611  022" id="11  022" >22</span>
 And the overseer of the Levites   was   the son of Bani, son of Ozi, son of Asabia, the son of Micha. Of the sons of Asaph the singers   some were   over the house of God,  <span class="verse" rel="v01611  023" id="11  023" >23</span>
 For so was the king's commandment concerning them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01611  024" id="11  024" >24</span>
 And Phathaia son of Baseza was in attendance on the king in every matter for the people,  <span class="verse" rel="v01611  025" id="11  025" >25</span>
 and with regard to villages in their country district: and   some   of the children of Juda lived in Cariatharboc,  <span class="verse" rel="v01611  026" id="11  026" >26</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="12  001">12  </span> Now these   are   the priests and the Levites that went up with Zorobabel the son of Salathiel and Jesus: Saraia, Jeremia, Esdra,  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  002" id="12  002" >2</span>
 Amaria, Maluch,  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  3-6" id="12  3-6" >3-6</span>
 Sechenia.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  007" id="12  007" >7</span>
 These   were   the chiefs of the priests, and their brethren in the days of Jesus.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  008" id="12  008" >8</span>
 And the Levites   were  , Jesus, Banui, Cadmiel, Sarabia, Jodae, Matthania: he   was   over the bands,  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  009" id="12  009" >9</span>
 and his brethren   were appointed   to the daily courses.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  010" id="12  010" >10</span>
 And Jesus begot Joakim, and Joakim begot Eliasib, and Eliasib   begot   Jodae,  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  011" id="12  011" >11</span>
 and Jodae begot Jonathan, and Jonathan begot Jadu.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  012" id="12  012" >12</span>
 And in the days of Joakim, his brethren the priests and the heads of families   were, belonging   to Saraia, Amaria; to Jeremia, Anania;  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  013" id="12  013" >13</span>
 to Esdra, Mesulam; to Amaria, Joanan;  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  014" id="12  014" >14</span>

 to Balgas, Samue; to Semia, Jonathan;  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  019" id="12  019" >19</span>

 to Elkia, Asabias; to Jedeiu, Nathanael.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  022" id="12  022" >22</span>
 The Levites in the days of Eliasib, Joada, and Joa, and Joanan, and Idua,   were   recorded heads of families: also the priests, in the reign of Darius the Persian.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  023" id="12  023" >23</span>
 And the sons of Levi, heads of families,   were   written in the book of the chronicles, even to the days of Joanan son of Elisue.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  024" id="12  024" >24</span>
 And the heads of the Levites   were   Asabia, and Sarabia, and Jesu: and the sons of Cadmiel, and their brethren over against them, were to sing hymns of praise, according to the commandment of David the man of God, course by course.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  025" id="12  025" >25</span>
 When I gathered the porters,  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  026" id="12  026" >26</span>
    it was   in the days of Joakim son of Jesus, son of Josedec, and in the days of Neemia: and Esdras the priest   was   scribe.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  027" id="12  027" >27</span>
 And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites in their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep a feast of dedication and gladness with thanksgiving, and they sounded cymbals with songs, and   had   lutes and harps.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  028" id="12  028" >28</span>
 And the sons of the singers were assembled both from the neighbourhood round about to Jerusalem, and from the villages,  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  029" id="12  029" >29</span>
 and from the country: for the singers built themselves villages by Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  030" id="12  030" >30</span>
 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and they purified the people, and the porters, and the wall.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  031" id="12  031" >31</span>
 And they brought up the princes of Juda on the wall, and they appointed two great   companies   for thanksgiving, and they passed on the right hand on the wall of the dung-gate.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  032" id="12  032" >32</span>
 And after them went Osaia, and half the princes of Juda,  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  033" id="12  033" >33</span>
 and Azarias, and Esdras, and Mesollam,  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  034" id="12  034" >34</span>
 and Juda, and Benjamin, and Samaias and Jeremia.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  035" id="12  035" >35</span>
 And   some   of the sons of the priest with trumpets, Zacharias son of Jonathan, son of Samaias, son of Matthania, son of Michaia, son of Zacchur, son of Asaph:  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  036" id="12  036" >36</span>
 and his brethren, Samaia, and Oziel, Gelol, Jama, Aia, Nathanael, and Juda, Anani, to praise with the hymns of David the man of God; and Esdras the scribe   was   before them,  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  37-38" id="12  37-38" >37-38</span>
 at the gate, to praise before them, and they went up by the steps of the city of David, in the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water-gate  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  39-41" id="12  39-41" >39-41</span>
 of Ephraim, and to the fish-gate, and by the tower of Anameel, and as far as the sheep-gate.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  042" id="12  042" >42</span>
 And the singers were heard, and were numbered.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  043" id="12  043" >43</span>
 And in that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced; for God had made them very joyful: and their wives and their children rejoiced: and the joy in Jerusalem was heard from afar off.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  044" id="12  044" >44</span>
 And in that day they appointed men over the treasuries, for the treasures, the first fruits, and the tithes, and   for   the chiefs of the cities who were assembled among them,   to furnish   portions for the priests and Levites: for   there was   joy in Juda over the priests and over the Levites that waited.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  045" id="12  045" >45</span>
 And they kept the charges of their God, and the charges of the purification, and   ordered   the singers and the porters, according to the commandments of David and his son Solomon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  046" id="12  046" >46</span>
 For in the days of David Asaph was originally first of the singers, and   they sang   hymns and praise to God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01612  047" id="12  047" >47</span>
 And all Israel in the days of Zorobabel, and in the days of Neemias, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, a daily rate: and consecrated them to the Levites: and the Levites consecrated them to the sons of Aaron.

<p><span class="chapter" id="13  001">13  </span> In that day they read in the book of Moses in the ears of the people; and it was found written in it, that the Ammonites and Moabites should not enter into the congregation of God for ever;  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  002" id="13  002" >2</span>
 because they met not the children of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them: but our God turned the curse into a blessing.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  003" id="13  003" >3</span>
 And it came to pass, when they heard the law, that they were separated,   even   every alien in Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  004" id="13  004" >4</span>
 And before this time Eliasib the priest lived in the treasury of the house of our God, connected with Tobias;  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  005" id="13  005" >5</span>
 and he made himself a great treasury, and there they were formerly in the habit of bestowing the offerings, and the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithe of the corn, and the wine, and the oil, the ordered portion of the Levites, and singers, and porters; and the first fruits of the priests.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  006" id="13  006" >6</span>
 But in all this   time   I was not in Jerusalem; for in the thirty-second year of Arthasastha king of Babylon I came to the king, and after a certain time I made my request of the king;  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  007" id="13  007" >7</span>
 and I came to Jerusalem, and I understood the mischief which Eliasib had done in the case of Tobias, in making for him a treasury in the court of the house of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  008" id="13  008" >8</span>
 And it appeared very evil to me: so I cast forth all the furniture of the house of Tobias from the treasury.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  009" id="13  009" >9</span>
 And I gave orders, and they purified the treasuries: and I restored there the vessels of the house of God,   and   the offerings, and the frankincense.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  010" id="13  010" >10</span>
 And I understood that the portion of the Levites had not been given: and they had fled every one to his field, the Levites and the singers doing the work.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  011" id="13  011" >11</span>
 And I strove with the commanders, and said, Therefore has the house of God been abandoned? and I assembled them, and set them in their place.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  012" id="13  012" >12</span>
 And all Juda brought a tithe of the wheat and the wine and the oil into the treasuries,  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  013" id="13  013" >13</span>
 to the charge of Selemia the priest, and Sadoc the scribe, and Phadaea of the Levites: and next to them   was   Anan the son of Zacchur, son of Matthanias; for they were accounted faithful:   it was   their office to distribute to their brethren.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  014" id="13  014" >14</span>
 Remember me, O God, in this, and let not my kindness be forgotten which I have wrought in   regard to   the house of the Lord God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  015" id="13  015" >15</span>
 In those days I saw in Juda   men   treading wine presses on the sabbath, and carrying sheaves, and loading asses with both wine, and grapes, and figs, and every   kind of   burden, and bringing them into Jerusalem on the sabbath-day:  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  016" id="13  016" >16</span>
 and I testified in the day of their sale. Also their lived in it   men   bringing fish, and selling every   kind of   merchandise to the children of Juda and in Jerusalem on the sabbath.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  017" id="13  017" >17</span>
 And I strove with the free children of Juda, and said to them, What   is   this evil thing which you° do, and profane the sabbath-day?  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  018" id="13  018" >18</span>
 Did not your fathers thus, and our God brought upon them and upon us and upon this city all these evils? and do you° bring additional wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath?  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  019" id="13  019" >19</span>
 And it came to pass, when the gates were set up in Jerusalem, before the sabbath, that I spoke, and they shut the gates; and I gave orders that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and I set   some   of my servants at the gates, that none should bring   in   burdens on the sabbath-day.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  020" id="13  020" >20</span>
 So all   the merchants   lodged, and carried on traffic without Jerusalem once or twice.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  021" id="13  021" >21</span>
 Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why do you° lodge in front of the wall? if you° do so again, I will stretch out my hand upon you. From that time they came not on the sabbath.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  022" id="13  022" >22</span>
 and I told the Levites who were purifying themselves, and came and kept the gates, that they should sanctify the sabbath-day. Remember me, O God, for these things, and spare me according to the abundance of your mercy.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  023" id="13  023" >23</span>
 And in those days I saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon,   and   of Moab:  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  024" id="13  024" >24</span>
 and their children spoke half in the language of Ashdod, and did not know how to speak in the Jewish language.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  025" id="13  025" >25</span>
 And I strove with them and cursed them; and I struck some of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God,   saying,   You° shall not give your daughters to their sons, and you° shall not take of their daughters to your sons.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  026" id="13  026" >26</span>
 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin thus? though there was no king like him among many nations, and he was beloved of God, and God made him king over all Israel; yet strange women turned him aside.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  027" id="13  027" >27</span>
 So we will not listen to you to do all this evil, to break covenant with our God, —to marry strange wives.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  028" id="13  028" >28</span>
 and Elisub the high priest,   one   of the sons of Joada,   being   son-in-law of Sanaballat the Uranite, I chased him away from me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  029" id="13  029" >29</span>
 Remember them, O God, for their   false   connection with the priesthood, and   the breaking   the covenant of the priesthood, and   for defiling   the Levites.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  030" id="13  030" >30</span>
 So I purged them from all foreign connection, and established courses for the priests and the Levites,   every   man according to his work.  <span class="verse" rel="v01613  031" id="13  031" >31</span>
 And the offering of the wood-bearers   was   at certain set times, and in the   times of the   first fruits. Remember me, O our God, for good.
