<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">N</span>ow in the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremias might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of the Persians, and he issued a proclamation through all his kingdom, and that in writing, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0151  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 Thus said Cyrus king of the Persians, The Lord God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has given me a charge to build him a house in Jerusalem that is in Judea.  <span class="verse" rel="v0151  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 Who   is   there among you of all his people? for his God shall be with him, and he shall go up to Jerusalem that is in Judea, and let him build the house of the God of Israel: he   is   the God that is in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0151  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And   let   every   Jew   that is left   go   from every place where he sojourns, and the men of his place shall help him with silver, and gold, and goods, and cattle, together with the voluntary offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0151  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 Then the chiefs of the families of Juda and Benjamin arose, and the priests, and the Levites, all whose spirit the Lord stirred up to go up to build the house of the Lord that   is   in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0151  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 And all that were round about strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with cattle, and with presents, besides the voluntary offerings.  <span class="verse" rel="v0151  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 And king Cyrus brought out the vessels of the house of the Lord, which Nabuchodonosor had brought from Jerusalem, and put in the house of his god.  <span class="verse" rel="v0151  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 And Cyrus king of the Persians brought them out by the hand of Mithradates the treasurer, and he numbered them to Sasabasar, the chief man of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v0151  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 And this   is   their number: thirty gold basins, and a thousand silver basins, nine and twenty changes, thirty golden goblets,  <span class="verse" rel="v0151  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 and four hundred   and   ten double silver   vessels  , and a thousand other vessels.  <span class="verse" rel="v0151  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 All the gold and silver vessels were five thousand four hundred,   even   all that went up with Sasabasar from the   place of   transportation, from Babylon to Jerusalem.

 And after this the perpetual whole burnt offering, and   offering   for the season of new moon, and for all the hallowed feasts to the Lord, and for every one that offered a free will offering to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0153  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 On the first day of the seventh month they began to offer whole burnt offerings to the Lord: but the foundation of the house of the Lord was not laid.  <span class="verse" rel="v0153  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 And they gave money to the stone-hewers and carpenters, and meat and drink, and oil, to the Sidonians, and Tyrians, to bring cedar trees from Libanus to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant of Cyrus king of the Persians to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0153  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 And in the second year of their coming to the house of God in Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zorobabel the   son   of Salathiel, and Jesus the   son   of Josedec, and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all who came from the captivity to Jerusalem, and they appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, over the workmen in the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0153  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 And Jesus and his sons and his brethren stood, Cadmiel and his sons the sons of Juda, over them that wrought the works in the house of God: the sons of Enadad, their sons and their brethren the Levites.  <span class="verse" rel="v0153  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 And they laid a foundation for building the house of the Lord: and the priests in their robes stood with trumpets and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the Lord, according to the order of David king of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0153  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 And they answered   each other   with praise and thanksgiving to the Lord,   saying  , For   it is   good, for his mercy to Israel   endures   for ever. And all the people shouted with a loud voice to praise the Lord at the laying the foundation of the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0153  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 But many of the priests and the Levites, and the elder men, heads of families, who had seen the former house on its foundation, and   who saw   this house with their eyes, wept with a loud voice: but the multitude shouted with joy to raise a song.  <span class="verse" rel="v0153  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 And the people did not distinguish the voice of the glad shout from the voice of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud voice, and the voice was heard even from afar off.

<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> And they that afflicted Juda and Benjamin heard, that the children of the captivity were building a house to the Lord God of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 And they drew near to Zorobabel, and to the heads of families, and said to them, We will build with you; for as you°   do  , we seek   to serve   our God, and we do sacrifice to him from the days of Asaradan king of Assur, who brought us hither.  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 then Zorobabel, and Jesus and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel said to them,   It is   not for us and you to build a house to our God, for we ourselves will build together to the Lord our God, as Cyrus the king of the Persians commanded us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 And the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Juda, and hindered them in building,  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  005" id="4  005" >5</span>
 and   continued   hiring   persons   against them, plotting to frustrate their counsel, all the days of Cyrus king of the Persians, and until the reign of Darius king of the Persians.  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 And in the reign of Assuerus, even in the beginning of his reign, they wrote a letter against the inhabitants of Juda and Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 And in the days of Arthasastha, Tabeel wrote peaceably to Mithradates and to the rest of his fellow-servants: the tribute-gatherer wrote to Arthasastha king of the Persians a writing in the Syrian tongue, and   the same   interpreted.  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 Reum the chancellor, and Sampsa the scribe wrote an epistle against Jerusalem to King Arthasastha,   saying,    <span class="verse" rel="v0154  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 Thus has judged Reum the chancellor, and Sampsa the scribe, and the rest of our fellow-servants, the Dinaeans, the Apharsathachaeans, the Tarphalaeans, the Apharsaeans, the Archyaeans, the Babylonians, the Susanachaeans, Davaeans,  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Assenaphar removed, and settled them in the cities of Somoron, and the rest   of them   beyond the river.  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 This   is   the purport of the letter, which they sent to him: Your servants the men beyond the river to king Arthasastha.  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 Be it known to the king, that the Jews who came up from you to us have come to Jerusalem the rebellious and wicked city, which they are building, and its walls are set in order, and they have established the foundations of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 Now then be it known to the king, that if that city be built up, and its walls completed, you shall have no tribute, neither will they pay   anything  , and this injures kings.  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  014" id="4  014" >14</span>
 And it is not lawful for us to see the dishonor of the king: therefore have we sent and made known   the matter   to the king;  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  015" id="4  015" >15</span>
 That examination may be made in your fathers' book of record; and you shall find, and you shall know that city   is   rebellious, and does harm to kings and countries, and there are in the midst of it from very old time refuges for   runaway   slaves: therefore this city has been made desolate.  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  016" id="4  016" >16</span>
 We therefore declare to the king, that, if that city be built, and its walls be set up, you shall not have peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  017" id="4  017" >17</span>
 Then the king sent to Reum the chancellor, and Sampsa the scribe, and the rest of their fellow-servants who lived in Samaria, and the rest beyond the river,   saying,   Peace; and he says,  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  018" id="4  018" >18</span>
 The tribute-gatherer whom you° sent to us, has been called before me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  019" id="4  019" >19</span>
 And a decree has been made by me, and we have examined, and found that city of old time exalts itself against kings, and that rebellions and desertions take place within it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  020" id="4  020" >20</span>
 And there were powerful kings in Jerusalem, and they ruled over all the   country   beyond the river, and abundant revenues and tribute were given to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  021" id="4  021" >21</span>
 Now therefore make a decree to stop the work of those men, and that city shall no more be built.  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  022" id="4  022" >22</span>
    See   that you° be careful of the decree,   not   to be remiss concerning this matter, lest at any time destruction should abound to the harm of kings.  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  023" id="4  023" >23</span>
 Then the tribute-gatherer of king Arthasastha read   the letter   before Reum the chancellor, and Sampsa the scribe, and his fellow-servants: and they went in haste to Jerusalem and through Juda, and caused them to cease with horses and an   armed   force.  <span class="verse" rel="v0154  024" id="4  024" >24</span>
 Then ceased the work of the house of God in Jerusalem, and it was at a stand until the second year of the reign of Darius king of the Persians.  
<!-- 5   024 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> And Aggaeus the prophet, and Zacharias the   son   of Addo, prophesied a prophesy to the Jews in Juda and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel,   even   to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0155  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 Then rose up Zorobabel the   son   of Salathiel, and Jesus the son of Josedec, and began to build the house of God that was in Jerusalem: and with them   were   the prophets of God assisting them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0155  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 At the same time came there upon them Thanthanai, the governor on this side the river, and Satharbuzanai, and their fellow-servants, and spoke thus to them, Who has ordained a decree for you to build this house, and to   provide   this preparation?  <span class="verse" rel="v0155  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 Then they spoke thus to them, What are the names of the men that build this city?  <span class="verse" rel="v0155  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 But the eyes of God were upon the captivity of Juda, and they did not cause them to cease till the decree was brought to Darius; and then was sent by the tribute-gatherer concerning this  <span class="verse" rel="v0155  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 the copy of a letter, which Thanthanai, the governor of the part on this side the river, and Satharbuzanai, and their fellow-servants the Apharsachaeans who were on this side of the river, sent to king Darius.  <span class="verse" rel="v0155  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 They sent an account to him, and thus it was written in it: All peace to king Darius.  <span class="verse" rel="v0155  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 Be it known to the king, that we went into the land of Judea, to the house of the great God; and it is building with choice stones, and they are laying timbers in the walls, and that work is prospering, and goes on favorably in their hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v0155  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 Then we asked those elders, and thus we said to them, Who gave you the order to build this house, and to   provide   this preparation?  <span class="verse" rel="v0155  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 And we asked them their names,   in order   to declare   them   to you, so as to write to you the names of their leading men.  <span class="verse" rel="v0155  011" id="5  011" >11</span>
 And they answered us thus, saying, We   are   the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we   are   building the house which had been built many years before this, and a great king of Israel built it, and established it for them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0155  012" id="5  012" >12</span>
 But after that our fathers provoked the God of heaven, he gave them into the hands of Nabuchodonosor the Chaldean, king of Babylon, and he destroyed this house, and carried the people captive to Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0155  013" id="5  013" >13</span>
 And in the first year of king Cyrus, Cyrus the king made a decree that this house of God should be built.  <span class="verse" rel="v0155  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 And the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nabuchodonosor brought out from the house that was in Jerusalem, and carried them into the temple of the king, them did king Cyrus bring out from the temple of the king, and gave them to Sabanasar the treasurer, who was over the treasurer;  <span class="verse" rel="v0155  015" id="5  015" >15</span>
 and said to him, Take all the vessels, and go, put them in the house that is in Jerusalem in their place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0155  016" id="5  016" >16</span>
 Then that Sabanazar came, and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem: and from that time even until now it has been building, and has not been finished.  <span class="verse" rel="v0155  017" id="5  017" >17</span>
 And now, if it   seem   good to the king, lest search be made in the treasure-house of the king at Babylon, that you may know   if it be   that a decree was made by king Cyrus to build that house of God that was in Jerusalem, and let the king send to us when he has learned concerning this   matter  .  
<!-- 6   017 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="6  001">6  </span> Then Darius the king made a decree, and caused a search to be made in the record-offices, where the treasure is stored in Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  002" id="6  002" >2</span>
 And there was found in the city, in the palace, a volume, and this was the record written in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  003" id="6  003" >3</span>
 In the first year of king Cyrus, Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the holy house of God that was in Jerusalem,   saying,   Let the house be built, and the place where they sacrifice the sacrifices. (Also he appointed its elevation, in height sixty cubits; its breadth   was   of sixty cubits.)  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  004" id="6  004" >4</span>
 And   let there be   three strong layers of stone, and one layer of timber; and the expense shall be paid out of the house of the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  005" id="6  005" >5</span>
 And the silver and the gold vessels of the house of God, which Nabuchodonosor carried off from the house that was in Jerusalem, and carried to Babylon, let them even be given, and be carried to the temple that is in Jerusalem, and put in the place where they were set in the house of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  006" id="6  006" >6</span>
 Now, you° rulers beyond the river, Satharbuzanai, and their fellow-servants the Apharsachaeans, who   are   on the other side of the river, give   these things  , keeping far from that place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  007" id="6  007" >7</span>
 Now let alone the work of the house of God: let the rulers of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build that house of God on its place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  008" id="6  008" >8</span>
 Also a decree has been made by me, if haply you° may do somewhat in concert with the elders of the Jews for the building of that house of God: to wit, out of the king's property,   even   the tributes beyond the river, let there be money to defray the expenses carefully granted to those men, so that they be not hindered.  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  009" id="6  009" >9</span>
 And whatever need   there may be  , you° shall give both the young of bulls and rams, and lambs for whole burnt offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, oil:—let it be given them according to the word of the priests that are in Jerusalem, day by day whatever they shall ask;  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  010" id="6  010" >10</span>
 that they may offer sweet savours to the God of heaven, and that they may pray for the life of the king and his sons.  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  011" id="6  011" >11</span>
 And a decree has been made by me, that every man who shall alter this word, timber shall be pulled down from his house, and let him be lifted up and slain upon it, and his house shall be confiscated.  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  012" id="6  012" >12</span>
 And may the God whose name dwells there, overthrow every king and people who shall stretch out his hand to alter or destroy the house of God which is in Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be diligently   attended to  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  013" id="6  013" >13</span>
 Then Thanthanai the governor on this side beyond the river, Satharbuzanai, and his fellow-servants, according to that which king Darius sent, so they did diligently.  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  014" id="6  014" >14</span>
 And the elders of the Jews and the Levites built, at the prophecy of Aggaeus the prophet, and Zacharias the son of Addo: and they built up, and finished   it  , by the decree of the God of Israel, and by the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Arthasastha, kings of the Persians.  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  015" id="6  015" >15</span>
 And they finished this house by the third day of the month Adar, which is the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  016" id="6  016" >16</span>
 And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of the house of God with gladness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  017" id="6  017" >17</span>
 And they offered for the dedication of the house of God a hundred calves, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, twelve kids of the goats for a sin-offering for all Israel, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  018" id="6  018" >18</span>
 And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their separate orders, for the services of God in Jerusalem, according to the writing of the book of Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  019" id="6  019" >19</span>
 And the children of the captivity kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  020" id="6  020" >20</span>
 For the priests and Levites were purified, all were clean to a man, and they killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  021" id="6  021" >21</span>
 And the children of Israel ate the passover,   even   they that were of the captivity, and every one who separated himself to them from the uncleanness of the nations of the land, to seek the Lord God of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0156  022" id="6  022" >22</span>
 and they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with gladness, because the Lord made them glad, and he turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the works of the house of the God of Israel.

<p><span class="chapter" id="7  001">7  </span> Now after these things, in the reign of Arthasastha king of the Persians, came up Esdras the son of Saraias, the son of Azarias, the son of Chelcias,  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  002" id="7  002" >2</span>
 the son of Selum, the son of Sadduc, the son of Achitob,  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  003" id="7  003" >3</span>
 the son of Samarias, the son of Esria, the son of Mareoth,  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  004" id="7  004" >4</span>
 the son of Zaraia, the son of Ozias, the son of Bokki,  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  005" id="7  005" >5</span>
 the son of Abisue, the son of Phinees, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the first priest.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  006" id="7  006" >6</span>
 This Esdras went up out of Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the Lord God of Israel gave: and the king gave him   leave  , for the hand of the Lord his God was upon him in all things which he sought.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  007" id="7  007" >7</span>
 And   some   of the children of Israel went up, and   some   of the priests, and of the Levites, and the singers, and the doorkeepers, and the Nathinim, to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Arthasastha the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  008" id="7  008" >8</span>
 And they came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, this   was   the seventh year of the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  009" id="7  009" >9</span>
 For in the first   day   of the first month he began the going up from Babylon, and in the first day of the fifth month, they came to Jerusalem, for the good hand of his God was upon him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  010" id="7  010" >10</span>
 For Esdras had determined in his heart to seek the law, and to do and teach the ordinances and judgments in Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  011" id="7  011" >11</span>
 And this   is   the copy of the order which Arthasastha gave to Esdras the priest, the scribe of the book of the words of the commandments of the Lord, and of his ordinances to Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  012" id="7  012" >12</span>
 Arthasastha, king of kings, to Esdras, the scribe of the law of the Lord God of heaven, Let the order and the answer be accomplished.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  013" id="7  013" >13</span>
 A decree is made by me, that every one who is willing in my kingdom of the people of Israel, and of the priests and Levites, to go to Jerusalem,   be permitted   to go with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  014" id="7  014" >14</span>
    One   has been sent from the king and the seven councillors, to visit Judea and Jerusalem, according to the law of their God that is in your hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  015" id="7  015" >15</span>
 And for the house of the Lord   there have been sent   silver and gold, which the king and the councillors have freely given to the God of Israel, who dwells in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  016" id="7  016" >16</span>
 And all the silver and gold, whatever you shall find in all the land of Babylon, with the free will offering of the people, and the priests that offer freely for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  017" id="7  017" >17</span>
 And as for every one that arrives   there  , speedily order him by this letter   to bring   calves, rams, lambs, and their meat-offerings, and their drink-offerings; and you shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  018" id="7  018" >18</span>
 And whatever it shall seem good to you and to your brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, do as it is pleasing to your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  019" id="7  019" >19</span>
 And deliver the vessels that are given you for the service of the house of God, before God in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  020" id="7  020" >20</span>
 And as to the rest of the need of the house of your God, you shall give from the king's treasure-houses,  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  021" id="7  021" >21</span>
 and from me, whatever it shall seem   good   to you to give. I king Arthasastha have made a decree for all the treasuries that are in the   country   beyond the river, that whatever Esdras the priest and scribe of the God of heaven may ask you, it shall be done speedily,  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  022" id="7  022" >22</span>
 to   the amount of   a hundred talents of silver, and a hundred measures of wheat, and a hundred baths of wine, and a hundred baths of oil, and salt without reckoning.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  023" id="7  023" >23</span>
 Let whatever is in the decree of the God of heaven, be done: take heed lest any one make an attack on the house of the God of heaven, lest at any time there shall be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  024" id="7  024" >24</span>
 Also this has been declared to you, with respect to all the priests, and Levites, the singers, porters, Nathinim and ministers of the house of God, let no tribute be   paid   to you; you shall not have power to oppress them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  025" id="7  025" >25</span>
 And you, Esdras, as the wisdom of God   is   in your hand, appoint scribes and judges, that they may judge for all the people beyond the river, all that know the law of the Lord your God; and you° shall make it known to him that knows not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  026" id="7  026" >26</span>
 And whoever shall not do the law of God, and the law of the king readily, judgment shall be taken upon him, whether for death or for chastisement, or for a fine of his property, or casting into prison.  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  027" id="7  027" >27</span>
 Blessed   be   the Lord God of our fathers, who has put it thus into the heart of the king, to glorify the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem;  <span class="verse" rel="v0157  028" id="7  028" >28</span>
 and has given me favor in the eyes of the king, and of his councillors, and all the rulers of the king, the exalted ones. And I was strengthened according to the good hand of God upon me, and I gathered chief men of Israel to go up with me.

<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> And these   are   the heads of their families, the leaders that went up with me in the reign of Arthasastha the king of Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  002" id="8  002" >2</span>

 And of the sons of Asgad; Joanan the son of Accatan, and with him a hundred and ten males.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 And of the sons of Adonicam   were the   last, and these   were   their names, Eliphalat, Jeel, and Samaea, and with them sixty males.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 And of the sons of Baguae, Uthai, and Zabud, and with him seventy males.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  015" id="8  015" >15</span>
 And I gathered them to the river that comes to Evi, and we encamped there three days: and I reviewed the people and the priests, and found none of the sons of Levi there.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  016" id="8  016" >16</span>
 And I sent men of understanding to Eleazar, to Ariel, to Semeias, and to Alonam, and to Jarib, and to Elnatham, and to Nathan, and to Zacharias, and to Mesollam, and to Joarim, and to Elnathan.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  017" id="8  017" >17</span>
 And I forwarded them to the rulers with the money of the place, and I put words in their mouth to speak to their brethren the Athinim with the money of the place, that they should bring us singers for the house of our God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  018" id="8  018" >18</span>
 And they came to us, as the good hand of our God was upon us, even a man of understanding of the sons of Mooli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel, and at the commencement came his sons and his brethren, eighteen.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  019" id="8  019" >19</span>
 And Asebia, and Isaia of the sons of Merari, his brethren and his sons, twenty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  020" id="8  020" >20</span>
 And of the Nathinim; whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites   there were   two hundred and twenty Nathinim; all were gathered by   their   names.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  021" id="8  021" >21</span>
 And I proclaimed there a fast, at the river Aue, that   we   should humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a straight way for us, and for our children, and for all our property.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  022" id="8  022" >22</span>
 For I was ashamed to ask of the king a guard and horsemen to save us from the enemy in the way: for we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God   is   upon all that seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath   are   upon all that forsake him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  023" id="8  023" >23</span>
 So we fasted, and asked of our God concerning this; and he listened to us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  024" id="8  024" >24</span>
 And I gave charge to twelve of the chiefs of the priests, to Saraia, to Asabia, and ten of their brethren with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  025" id="8  025" >25</span>
 And I weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of the first fruits of the house of our God, which the king, and his councillors, and his princes, and all Israel that were found, had dedicated.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  026" id="8  026" >26</span>
 I even weighed into their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and a hundred silver vessels, and a hundred talents of gold;  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  027" id="8  027" >27</span>
 and twenty golden bowls,   weighing   about a thousand drachmas, and superior vessels of fine shining brass,   precious   as gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  028" id="8  028" >28</span>
 And I said to them, You°   are   holy to the Lord; and the vessels   are   holy; and the silver and the gold are free will offerings to the Lord God of our fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  029" id="8  029" >29</span>
 Be watchful and keep them, until you° weigh   them   before the chief priests and the Levites, and the chiefs of families in Jerusalem, at the chambers of the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  030" id="8  030" >30</span>
 So the priests and the Levites took the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring to Jerusalem into the house of our God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  031" id="8  031" >31</span>
 And we departed from the river of Aue on the twelfth day of the first month, to come to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and delivered us from the hand of the enemy and adversary in the way.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  032" id="8  032" >32</span>
 And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  033" id="8  033" >33</span>
 And it came to pass on the fourth day that we weighed the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, in the house of our God, into the hand of Merimoth the son of Uria the priest; and with him   was   Eleazar the son of Phinees, and with them Jozabad the son of Jesus, and Noadia the son of Banaia, the Levites.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  034" id="8  034" >34</span>
 All things   were reckoned   by number and weight, and the whole weight was written   down  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  035" id="8  035" >35</span>
 At that time the children of the banishment that came from the captivity offered whole burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve calves for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, twelve goats for a sin-offering; all whole burnt offerings to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0158  036" id="8  036" >36</span>
 And they gave the king's mandate to the king's lieutenants, and the governors beyond the river: and they honored the people and the house of God.

<p><span class="chapter" id="9  001">9  </span> And when these things were finished, the princes drew near to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands in their abominations,   even   the Chananite, the Ethite, the Pherezite, the Jebusite, the Ammonite, the Moabite, and the Moserite and the Amorite.  <span class="verse" rel="v0159  002" id="9  002" >2</span>
 For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and their sons; and the holy seed has passed among the nations of the lands, and the hand of the rulers   has been   first in this transgression.  <span class="verse" rel="v0159  003" id="9  003" >3</span>
 And when I heard this thing, I tore my garments, and trembled, and plucked   some   of the hairs of my head and of my beard, and sat down mourning.  <span class="verse" rel="v0159  004" id="9  004" >4</span>
 Then there assembled to me all that followed the word of the God of Israel, on account of the transgression of the captivity; and I remained mourning until the evening sacrifice.  <span class="verse" rel="v0159  005" id="9  005" >5</span>
 And at the evening sacrifice I rose up from my humiliation; and when I had tore my garments, then I trembled, and I bow myself on my knees, and spread out my hands to the Lord God,  <span class="verse" rel="v0159  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
 and I said, O Lord, I am ashamed and confounded, O my God, to lift up my face to you: for our transgressions have abounded over our head, and our trespasses have increased even to heaven.  <span class="verse" rel="v0159  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 From the days of our fathers we have been in a great trespass until this day: and because of our iniquities we, and our kings, and our children, have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the Gentiles by the sword, and by captivity, and by spoil, and with shame of our face, as at this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0159  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 And now our God has dealt mercifully with us, so as to leave us to escape, and to give us an establishment in the place of his sanctuary, to enlighten our eyes, and to give a little quickening in our servitude.  <span class="verse" rel="v0159  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 For we are slaves, yet in our servitude the Lord our God has not deserted us; and he has extended favor to us in the sight of the kings of the Persians, to give us a quickening, that they should raise up the house of our God, and restore the desolate places of it, and to give us a fence in Juda and Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0159  010" id="9  010" >10</span>
 What shall we say, our God, after this? for we have forsaken your commandments,  <span class="verse" rel="v0159  011" id="9  011" >11</span>
 which you have given us by the hand of your servants the prophets, saying, The land, into which you° go to inherit it, is a land subject to disturbance by the removal of the people of the nations for their abominations, wherewith they have filled it from one end to the other by their uncleanness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0159  012" id="9  012" >12</span>
 And now give not your daughters to their sons, and take not of their daughters for your sons, neither shall you° seek their peace or their good for ever: that you° may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and transmit it as an inheritance to your children for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0159  013" id="9  013" >13</span>
 And after all that is come upon us because of our evil deeds, and our great trespass,   it is clear   that there is none such as our God, for you have lightly visited our iniquities, and given us deliverance;  <span class="verse" rel="v0159  014" id="9  014" >14</span>
 whereas we have repeatedly broken your commandments, and intermarried with the people of the lands: be not very angry with us to   our   utter destruction, so that there should be no remnant or escaping one.  <span class="verse" rel="v0159  015" id="9  015" >15</span>
 O Lord God of Israel, you   are   righteous; for we remain   yet   escaped, as at this day: behold, we   are   before you in our trespasses: for we can’t stand before you on this account.

<p><span class="chapter" id="10  001">10  </span> So when Esdras   had   prayed, and when he   had   confessed, weeping and praying before the house of God, a very great assembly of Israel came together to him, men and women and youths; for the people wept, and wept aloud.  <span class="verse" rel="v01510  002" id="10  002" >2</span>
 And Sechenias the son of Jeel, of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Esdras, We have broken covenant with our God, and have taken strange wives of the nations of the land: yet now there is patience   of hope   to Israel concerning this thing.  <span class="verse" rel="v01510  003" id="10  003" >3</span>
 Now then let us make a covenant with our God, to put away all the wives, and their offspring, as you shall advise:  <span class="verse" rel="v01510  004" id="10  004" >4</span>
 arise, and alarm them with the commands of our God; and let   it   be done according to the law. Rise up, for the matter   is   upon you; and we   are   with you: be strong and do.  <span class="verse" rel="v01510  005" id="10  005" >5</span>
 Then Esdras arose, and caused the rulers, the priests, and Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word: and they swore.  <span class="verse" rel="v01510  006" id="10  006" >6</span>
 And Esdras rose up from before the house of God, and went to the treasury of Joanan the son of Elisub; he even went there: he ate no bread, and drank no water; for he mourned over the unfaithfulness   of them   of the captivity.  <span class="verse" rel="v01510  007" id="10  007" >7</span>
 And they made proclamation throughout Juda and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should assemble at Jerusalem,   saying  ,  <span class="verse" rel="v01510  008" id="10  008" >8</span>
 Every one who shall not arrive within three days, as   is   the counsel of the rulers and the elders, all his substance shall be forfeited, and he shall be separated from the congregation of the captivity.  <span class="verse" rel="v01510  009" id="10  009" >9</span>
 So all the men of Juda and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days. This   was   the ninth month: on the twentieth day of the month all the people sat down in the street of the house of the Lord, because of their alarm concerning the word, and because of the storm.  <span class="verse" rel="v01510  010" id="10  010" >10</span>
 And Esdras the priest arose, and said to them, You° have broken covenant, and have taken strange wives, to add to the trespass of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01510  011" id="10  011" >11</span>
 Now therefore give praise to the Lord God of our fathers, and do that which is pleasing in his sight: and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the strange wives.  <span class="verse" rel="v01510  012" id="10  012" >12</span>
 Then all the congregation answered and said, This your word   is   powerful upon us to do it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01510  013" id="10  013" >13</span>
 But the people   is   numerous, and the season   is   stormy, and there is no power to stand without, and the work is more than enough for one day or for two; for we have greatly sinned in this matter.  <span class="verse" rel="v01510  014" id="10  014" >14</span>
 Let now our rulers stand, and for all those in our cities who have taken strange wives, let them come at appointed times, and with them elders from every several city, and judges, to turn away the fierce wrath of our God from us concerning this matter.  <span class="verse" rel="v01510  015" id="10  015" >15</span>
 Only Jonathan the son of Asael, and Jazias the son of Thecoe   were   with me concerning this; and Mesollam, and Sabbathai the Levite helped them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01510  016" id="10  016" >16</span>
 And the children of the captivity did thus: and Esdras the priest, and heads of families according to   their   house were separated, and all by their names, for they returned in the first day of the tenth month to search out the matter.  <span class="verse" rel="v01510  017" id="10  017" >17</span>
 And they made an end with all the men who had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.  <span class="verse" rel="v01510  018" id="10  018" >18</span>
 And there were found   some   of the sons of the priests who had taken strange wives: of the sons of Jesus the son of Josedec, and his brethren; Maasia, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gadalia.  <span class="verse" rel="v01510  019" id="10  019" >19</span>
 And they pledged themselves to put away their wives, and   offered   a ram of the flock for a trespass-offering because of their trespass.  <span class="verse" rel="v01510  020" id="10  020" >20</span>
