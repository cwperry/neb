<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">[</span>In the second year of the reign of Artaxerxes the great king, on the first   day   of Nisan, Mardochaeus the   son   of Jarius, the   son   of Semeias, the   son   of Cisaus, of the tribe of Benjamine, a Jew dwelling in the city Susa, a great man, serving in the king's palace, saw a vision. Now he was of the captivity which Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried captive from Jerusalem, with Jachonias the king of Judea. And this was his dream: Behold, voices and a noise, thunders and earthquake, tumult upon the earth. And, behold, two great serpents came forth, both ready for conflict, and there came from them a great voice, and by their voice every nation was prepared for battle, even to fight against the nation of the just. And, behold, a day of darkness and blackness, tribulation and anguish, affection and tumult upon the earth. And all the righteous nation was troubled, fearing their own afflictions; and they prepared to die, and cried to God: and from their cry there came as it were a great river from a little fountain,   even   much water. And light and the sun arose, and the lowly were exalted, and devoured the honorable. And Mardochaeus who had seen this vision and what God desired to do, having  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   arisen.  </span>  awoke, kept it in his heart, and desired by all means to interpret it, even till night. And Mardochaeus rested quiet in the palace with Gabatha and Tharrha the king's two chamberlains, eunuchs who guarded the palace. And he heard their reasoning and searched out their plans, and learned that they were preparing to lay hands on king Artaxerxes: and he informed the king concerning them. And the king examined the two chamberlains, and they confessed, and were  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit   led away, see Acts 12. 19.  </span>  executed. And the king wrote these things for a memorial: also Mardochaeus wrote concerning these matters. And the king commanded Mardochaeus to attend in the palace, and gave gifts for this service. And Aman the son of Amadathes the Bugean was honorable in the sight of the king, and he endeavored to hurt Mardochaeus and his people, because of the two chamberlains of the king.]  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Note. -   In the   Heb.   and some copies of LXX, Esther begins here.  </span>  And it came to pass after these  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   words.  </span>  things in the days of Artaxerxes, —(this Artaxerxes ruled over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India)—  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 in those days, when king Artaxerxes was on the throne in the city of Susa,  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 in the third year of his reign, he made a feast to his friends, and the other nations, and to the nobles of the Persians and Medes, and the chief of the satraps.  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And after this, after he had shown to them the wealth of his kingdom, and the abundant glory of his wealth during a hundred and eighty days,  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 when,   I say  , the days of the marriage feast were completed, the king made a banquet to the nations who were present in the city six days, in the court of the king's house,  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
    which was   adorned with   hangings   of fine linen and flax on cords of fine linen and purple, fastened to golden and silver studs, on pillars of Parian marble and stone:   there were   golden and silver couches on a pavement of emerald stone, and of pearl, and of Parian stone,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   transparent.  </span>  and open-worked coverings variously flowered,   having   roses worked round about;  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 gold and silver cups, and a small cup of carbuncle set out of the value of thirty thousand talents, abundant and sweet wine, which the king himself drank.  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 And this banquet was not according to the appointed law; but so the king would have it: and he charged the stewards to perform his will and that of the company.  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 Also Astin the queen made a banquet for the women in the palace where king Artaxerxes   lived  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 Now on the seventh day the king, being merry, told Aman, and Bazan, and Tharrha, and Barazi, and Zatholtha, and Abataza, and Tharaba, the seven chamberlains, servants of king Artaxerxes,  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 to bring in the queen to him, to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to make her queen.  </span>  enthrone her, and crown her with the diadem, and to show her to the princes, and her beauty to the nations: for she was beautiful.  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 But queen Astin listened not to him to come with the chamberlains: so the king was grieved and angered.  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 And he said to his friends, Thus have Astin spoken: pronounce therefore upon this   case   law and judgment.  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 So Arkesaeus, and Sarsathaeus, and Malisear, the princes of the Persians and Medes, who were near the king, who sat chief   in rank   by the king, drew near to him,  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 and reported to him according to the laws how it was proper to do to queen Astin, because she had not done the things commanded of the king by the chamberlains.  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 And Muchaeus said to the king and to the princes, Queen Astin has not wronged the king only, but also all the king's rulers and princes:  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 for he has told them the words of the queen, and how she  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   contradicted.  </span>  disobeyed the king. As then,   said he  , she refused   to obey   king Artaxerxes,  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 so this day shall the other ladies of the chiefs of the Persians and Medes, having heard what she said to the king, dare in the same way to dishonor their husbands.  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 If then it seem good to the king, let him make a royal decree, and let it be written according to the laws of the Medes and Persians, and let him not alter   it  : and let not the queen come in to him any more; and let the king give her royalty to a woman better than she.  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 And let the law of the king which he shall have made, be widely proclaimed, in his kingdom: and so shall all the women give honor to their husbands, from the poor even to the rich.  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  021" id="1  021" >21</span>
 And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did as Muchaeus had said,  <span class="verse" rel="v0171  022" id="1  022" >22</span>
 and sent into all his kingdom through the several provinces, according to their language,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   that there might be fear to them, etc.  </span>  in order that men might be feared in their own houses.  
<!-- 2   022 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> And after this the king's anger was pacified, and he no more mentioned Astin, bearing in mind what she had said, and how he had condemned her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 Then the servants of the king said, Let there be sought for the king chaste   and   beautiful young virgins.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 And let the king appoint local governors in all the provinces of his kingdom, and let them select fair   and   chaste young damsels   and bring them   to the city Susa, into the women's apartment, and let them be consigned to the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women; and let things for purification and other attendance be given   to them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 And let the woman who shall please the king be queen instead of Astin. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 Now there was a Jew in the city Susa, and his name was Mardochaeus, the   son   of Jairus,   the son   of Semeias,   the son   of Cisaeus, of the tribe of Benjamin;  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 who had been brought a prisoner from Jerusalem, which Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried into captivity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 And he had a foster child, daughter of Aminadab his father's brother, and her name   was   Esther; and when her parents were dead, he brought her up for a wife for himself: and the damsel was beautiful.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 And because the king's ordinance was published, many damsels were gathered to the city Susa under the hand of Gai; and Esther was brought to Gai the keeper of the women.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 And the damsel pleased him, and she found favor in his sight; and he hasted to give her the things for purification, and her portion, and the seven maidens appointed her out of the palace: and he treated her and her maidens well in the women's apartment.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 But Esther didn’t reveal her family nor her kindred: for Mardochaeus had charged her not to tell.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 But Mardochaeus used to walk every day by the women's court, to see what would become of Esther.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 Now this was the time for a virgin to go into the king, when she should have fulfilled twelve months; for so are the days of purification fulfilled, six months while they are anointing themselves with oil of myrrh, and six months with spices and women's purifications.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 And then   the damsel   goes in to the king; and   the officer   to whoever he shall give the command, will bring her to come in with him from the women's apartment to the king's chamber.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 She enters in the evening, and in the morning she departs to the second women's apartment, where Gai the king's chamberlain   is   keeper of the women: and she goes not in to the king again, unless she should be called by name.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 And when the time. was fulfilled for Esther the daughter of Aminadab the brother of Mardochaeus' father to go in to the king, she neglected nothing which the chamberlain, the women's keeper, commanded; for Esther found grace in the sight of all that looked upon her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 So Esther went in to king Artaxerxes in the twelfth month, which is Adar, in the seventh year of his reign.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 And the king loved Esther, and she found favor beyond all the   other   virgins: and he put on her the queen's crown.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 And the king made a banquet for all his friends and great men for seven days, and he highly celebrated the marriage of Esther; and he made a release to those who were under his dominion.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 But Mardochaeus served in the palace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 Now Esther had not revealed her  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   country.  </span>  kindred; for so Mardochaeus commanded her, to fear God, and perform his commandments, as when she was with him: and Esther changed not her manner of life.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 And two chamberlains of the king, the chiefs of the body-guard, were grieved, because Mardochaeus was promoted; and they sought to kill king Artaxerxes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 And the matter was revealed to Mardochaeus, and he made it known to Esther, and she declared to the king the matter of the conspiracy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0172  023" id="2  023" >23</span>
 And the king examined the two chamberlains, and hanged them: and the king gave orders to make a note for a memorial in the royal  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   library.  </span>  records of the good offices of Mardochaeus, as a commendation.  
<!-- 3   023 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> And after this king Artaxerxes highly honored Aman   son   of Amadathes, the Bugaean, and exalted him, and set his seat above all his friends.  <span class="verse" rel="v0173  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 And all in the palace did him obeisance, for so the king had given orders to do: but Mardochaeus did not do him obeisance.  <span class="verse" rel="v0173  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 And they in the king's palace said to Mardochaeus, Mardochaeus, why do you transgress the commands of the king?  <span class="verse" rel="v0173  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
    Thus   they spoke daily to him, but he listened not to them; so they represented to Aman that Mardochaeus resisted the commands of the king: and Mardochaeus had shown to them that he was a Jew.  <span class="verse" rel="v0173  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 And when Aman understood that Mardochaeus did not obeisance to him, he was greatly enraged,  <span class="verse" rel="v0173  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 and took counsel to destroy utterly all the Jews who were under the rule of Artaxerxes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0173  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 And he made a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   vote by ballot.  </span>  decree in the twelfth year of the reign of Artaxerxes, and cast lots daily and monthly, to kill in one day the race of Mardochaeus: and the lot fell on the fourteenth   day   of the month which is Adar.  <span class="verse" rel="v0173  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 And he spoke to king Artaxerxes, saying, There is a nation scattered among the nations in all your kingdom, and their laws differ from   those of   all the   other   nations; and they disobey the laws of the king; and it is not expedient for the king to let them alone.  <span class="verse" rel="v0173  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 If it seem good to the king, let him make a decree to destroy them: and I will remit into the king's treasury ten thousand talents of silver.  <span class="verse" rel="v0173  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 And the king took off his ring, and gave it into the hands of Aman, to seal the decrees against the Jews.  <span class="verse" rel="v0173  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 And the king said to Aman, Keep the silver, and treat the nation as you will.  <span class="verse" rel="v0173  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 So the king's recorders were called in the first month, on the thirteenth   day  , and they wrote as Aman commanded to the captains and governors in every province, from India even to Ethiopia, to a hundred and twenty-seven provinces; and to the rulers of the nations according to their   several   languages, in the name of king Artaxerxes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0173  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 And   the message   was sent by posts throughout the kingdom of Artaxerxes, to destroy utterly the race of the Jews on the first day of the twelfth month, which is Adar, and to plunder their goods.  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Note. -   The part in brackets is not in   Heb. </span>  [And the following is the copy of the letter; The great king Artaxerxes writes thus to the rulers and inferior governors of a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India even to Ethiopia, who hold authority under   him  . Ruling over many nations and having obtained dominion over the whole world, I was minded (not elated by the confidence of power, but ever conducting   myself   with great moderation and gentleness) to make the lives of   my   subjects continually tranquil, desiring both to maintain the kingdom quiet and orderly to   its   utmost limits, and to restore the peace desired by all men. But when I had enquired of my counselors how this should be brought to pass. Aman, who excels in soundness of judgment among us, and has been manifestly well inclined without wavering and with unshaken fidelity, and had obtained the second post in the kingdom, informed us that a certain ill-disposed people is mixed up with all the tribes throughout the world, opposed in their law to every   other   nation, and continually neglecting the commands of the king, so that the united government blamelessly administered by us is not quietly established. Having then conceived that this nation   alone of all others   is continually set in opposition to every man, introducing as a change a foreign code of laws, and injuriously plotting to accomplish the worst of evils against our interests, and against the happy establishment of the monarchy; we signified to you in the letter written by Aman, who is set over   the public   affairs and is our second governor, to destroy them all utterly with their wives and children by the swords of the enemies, without pitying or sparing any, on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar, of the present year; that the people aforetime and now ill-disposed   to us   having been violently consigned to death in one day, may hereafter secure to us continually a well constituted and quiet   state of affairs.]     <span class="verse" rel="v0173  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 And the copies of the letters were published in every province; and an order was given to all the nations to be ready against that day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0173  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 And the business was hastened, and   that   at Susa: and the king and Aman began to drink; but the city was troubled.  
<!-- 4   015 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> But Mardochaeus having perceived what was done, tore his garments, and put on sackcloth, and sprinkled dust upon himself; and having rushed forth through the open street of the city, he cried with a loud voice, A nation that has done no wrong is going to be destroyed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0174  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 And he came to the king's gate, and stood; for it was not lawful for him to enter into the palace, wearing sackcloth and ashes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0174  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 And in every province where the letters were published,   there was   crying and lamentation and great mourning on the part of the Jews: they spread for themselves sackcloth and ashes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0174  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 And the queen's maids and chamberlains went in and told her: and when she had heard what was done, she was disturbed; and she sent to clothe Mardochaeus, and take away his sackcloth; but he consented not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0174  5-6" id="4  5-6" >5-6</span>
 So Esther called for her chamberlain Achrathaeus, who waited upon her; and she sent to learn the truth from Mardochaeus.  <span class="verse" rel="v0174  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 And Mardochaeus showed him what was done, and the promise which Aman had made the king of ten thousand talents   to be paid   into the treasury, that he might destroy the Jews.  <span class="verse" rel="v0174  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 And he gave him the copy   of the writing   that was published in Susa concerning their destruction, to show to Esther; and told him to charge her to go in and entreat the king, and to beg him for the people, remembering,   said he  , the days of your low estate, how you were nursed by my hand: because Aman who holds the next place to the king has spoken against us for death. Do you call upon the Lord, and speak to the king concerning us, to deliver us from death.  <span class="verse" rel="v0174  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 So Achrathaeus went in and told her all these words.  <span class="verse" rel="v0174  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 And Esther said to Achrathaeus, Go to Mardochaeus, and say,  <span class="verse" rel="v0174  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 All the nations of the empire know, that whoever, man or woman, shall go in to the king into the inner court uncalled, that person can’t live: only to whoever the king shall stretch out   his   golden sceptre, he shall live: and I have not been called to go into the king, for these thirty days.  <span class="verse" rel="v0174  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 And Achrathaeus reported to Mardochaeus all the words of Esther.  <span class="verse" rel="v0174  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 Then Mardochaeus said to Achrathaeus, Go, and say to her, Esther, say not to yourself that you alone will escape in the kingdom, more than all the   other   Jews.  <span class="verse" rel="v0174  014" id="4  014" >14</span>
 For if you shall refuse to listen on this occasion, help and protection will be to the Jews from another quarter; but you and your father's house will perish: and who knows, if you have been made queen for this   very   occasion?  <span class="verse" rel="v0174  015" id="4  015" >15</span>
 And Esther sent the   man   that came to her to Mardochaeus, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0174  016" id="4  016" >16</span>
 Go and assemble the Jews that are in Susa, and fast you° for me, and eat not and drink not for three days, night and day: and I also and my maidens will fast; and then I will go in to the king contrary to the law, even if I must die.  <span class="verse" rel="v0174  017" id="4  017" >17</span>
 So Mardochaeus went and did all that Esther commanded him.  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Note. -   The part between brackets,   i.e.   to the end of chap.   iv.   is not in the   Heb. </span>  [And he implored the Lord, making mention of all the works of the Lord; and he said, Lord  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See 3 Kings 8. 53.

And you are Lord of all, and there is no one who shall resist you Lord. You know all things: you know, Lord, that it is not in insolence, nor haughtiness, nor love of glory, that I have done this, to refuse obeisance to the haughty Aman. For I would gladly have kissed the soles of his feet for the safety of Israel. But I have done this, that I might not set the glory of man above the glory of God: and I will not worship any one except you, my Lord, and I will not do these things in haughtiness. And now, O Lord God, the King, the God of Abraam, spare your people, for   our enemies   are looking upon us to   our   destruction, and they have desired to destroy your ancient inheritance. Do not overlook your  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   portion.  </span>  peculiar people, whom you have redeemed for yourself out of the land of Egypt. Listen to my prayer, and be propitious to your inheritance, and turn our mourning into gladness, that we may live and sing praise to your name, O Lord; and do not utterly destroy the mouth of them that praise you, O Lord. And all Israel cried with   all   their might, for death   was   before their eyes. And queen Esther betook herself for refuge to the Lord, being taken   as it were   in the agony of death. And having taken off her glorious apparel, she put on garments of distress and mourning; and instead of grand perfumes she filled her head with ashes and dung, and she greatly brought down her body, and she filled every place of her glad adorning with the   torn   curls of her hair. And she implored the Lord God of Israel, and said, O my Lord, you alone are our king: help me   who am   destitute, and have no helper but you, for my danger   is    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in my hand.  </span>  near at hand. I have heard from my birth, in the tribe of my kindred that you, Lord, took Israel out of all the nations, and our fathers out of all their kindred for a perpetual inheritance, and have wrought for them all that you have said. And now we have sinned before you, and you have delivered us into the hands of our enemies, because we honored their gods: you are righteous, O Lord. But now they have not been contented with the bitterness of our slavery, but have laid their hands on the hands of their idols,   in order   to abolish the decree of your mouth, and utterly to destroy your inheritances, and to stop the mouth of them that praise you, and to extinguish the glory of your house and your altar, and to open the mouth of the Gentiles to   speak   the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   virtues.  </span>  praises of vanities, and   in order   that a mortal king should be admired for ever. O Lord, do not resign your sceptre to them that are not, and let them not laugh at our fall, but turn their counsel against themselves and make an example of him who has  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   begun against us.  </span>  begun   to injure   us.

And being splendidly arrayed,   and   having called upon God the Overseer and Preserver of all things, she took her two maids, and she leaned upon one, as a delicate female, and the other followed bearing her train. And she   was   blooming in the perfection of her beauty; and her face   was   cheerful, and   it were   benevolent, but her heart   was   straitened for fear. And having passed through all the doors, she stood before the king: and he was sitting upon his royal throne, and he had put on all his glorious apparel,   covered   all over with gold and precious stones, and was very terrible. And having raised his face resplendent with glory, he looked with intense anger: and the queen fell, and changed her color as she fainted; and she bowed herself upon the head of the maid that went before   her  . But God changed the spirit of the king to gentleness, and in intense feeling he sprang from off his throne, and took her into his arms, until she recovered: and he comforted her with peaceful words, and said to her, What is   the matter  , Esther? I   am   your brother; be of good cheer, you shall not die, for our command is openly declared   to you  , Draw near.  <span class="verse" rel="v0175  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 And having raised the golden sceptre he laid it upon her neck, and embraced her, and said, Speak to me. And she said to him, I saw you,   my   lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of your glory; for you,   my   lord, are to be wondered at, and your face   is   full of grace. And while she was speaking, she fainted and fell. Then the king was troubled, and all his servants comforted her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0175  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 And the king said, What will you, Esther? and what is your request?   ask   even to the half of my kingdom, and it shall be yours.  <span class="verse" rel="v0175  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 And Esther said, To-day is my great day: if then it seem good to the king, let both him and Aman come to the feast which I will prepare this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0175  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 And the king said, Hasten Aman hither, that we may perform the word of Esther. So they both come to the feast of which Esther had spoken.  <span class="verse" rel="v0175  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 And at the banquet the king said to Esther, What is   your request  , queen Esther?   speak  , and you shall have all that you require.  <span class="verse" rel="v0175  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 And she said, My request and my petition   are  :  <span class="verse" rel="v0175  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 if I have found favor in the sight of the king, let the king and Aman come again to-morrow to the feast which I shall prepare for them, and to-morrow I will do the same.  <span class="verse" rel="v0175  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 So Aman went out from the king very glad   and   merry: but when Aman saw Mardochaeus the Jew in the court, he was greatly enraged.  <span class="verse" rel="v0175  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 And having gone into his own house, he called his friends, and his wife Zosara.  <span class="verse" rel="v0175  011" id="5  011" >11</span>
 And he showed them his wealth, and the glory with which the king had invested him, and how he had caused him to take precedence and bear chief rule in the kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0175  012" id="5  012" >12</span>
 And Aman said, The queen has called no one to the feast with the king but me, and I am invited to-morrow.  <span class="verse" rel="v0175  013" id="5  013" >13</span>
 But these things please me not, while I see Mardochaeus the Jew in the court.  <span class="verse" rel="v0175  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 And Zosara his wife and his friends said to him, Let there be a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a tree cut.  </span>  gallows made for you of fifty cubits, and in the morning do you speak to the king, and let Mardochaeus be hanged on the gallows: but do you go in to the feast with the king, and be merry. And the saying pleased Aman, and the gallows was prepared.  
<!-- 6   014 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="6  001">6  </span> But the Lord removed sleep from the king that night: and he told his servant to bring in the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   letters.  </span>  books, the registers of daily events, to read to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0176  002" id="6  002" >2</span>
 And he found the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   letters.  </span>  records written concerning Mardochaeus, how he had told the king concerning the two chamberlains of the king, when they were keeping guard, and sought to lay hands on Artaxerxes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0176  003" id="6  003" >3</span>
 And the king said, What honor or favor have we done to Mardochaeus? And the king's servants said, You have not done anything to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0176  004" id="6  004" >4</span>
 And while the king was enquiring about the kindness of Mardochaeus, behold, Aman   was   in the court. And the king said, Who   is   in the court? Now Aman was come in to speak to the king, that he should hang Mardochaeus on the gallows, which he had prepared.  <span class="verse" rel="v0176  005" id="6  005" >5</span>
 And the king's servants said, Behold, Aman stands in the court. And the king said, Call him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0176  006" id="6  006" >6</span>
 And the king said to Aman, What shall I do to the man whom I wish to honor? And Aman said within himself, Whom would the king honor but myself?  <span class="verse" rel="v0176  007" id="6  007" >7</span>
 and he said to the king, As for the man whom the king wishes to honor,  <span class="verse" rel="v0176  008" id="6  008" >8</span>
 let the king's servants bring the robe of fine linen which the king puts on, and the horse on which the king rides,  <span class="verse" rel="v0176  009" id="6  009" >9</span>
 and let him give   it   to one of the king's noble friends, and let him array the man whom the king loves; and let him mount him on the horse, and proclaim through the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   wide space.  </span>  street of the city, saying, Thus shall it be   done   to every man whom the king honors.  <span class="verse" rel="v0176  010" id="6  010" >10</span>
 Then the king said to Aman, You have well said: so do to Mardochaeus the Jew, who waits in the palace, and let not a word of what you have spoken be neglected.  <span class="verse" rel="v0176  011" id="6  011" >11</span>
 So Aman took the robe and the horse, and arrayed Mardochaeus, and mounted him on the horse, and went through the street of the city, and proclaimed, saying, Thus shall it be to every man whom the king wishes to honor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0176  012" id="6  012" >12</span>
 And Mardochaeus returned to the palace: but Aman went home mourning, and having his head covered.  <span class="verse" rel="v0176  013" id="6  013" >13</span>
 And Aman related the events that had befallen him to Zosara his wife, and to   his   friends: and his friends and his wife said to him,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   if it be M. etc. before whom.  </span>  If Mardochaeus   be   of the race of the Jews,   and   you have begun to be humbled before him, you will assuredly fall, and you will not be able to withstand him, for the living God   is   with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0176  014" id="6  014" >14</span>
 While they were yet speaking, the chamberlains arrived, to hasten Aman to the banquet which Esther had prepared.  
<!-- 7   014 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="7  001">7  </span> So the king and Aman went in to drink with the queen.  <span class="verse" rel="v0177  002" id="7  002" >2</span>
 And the king said to Esther at the banquet on the second day, What is it, queen Esther? and what   is   your request, and what   is   your petition? and it shall be   done   for you, to the half of my kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0177  003" id="7  003" >3</span>
 And she answered and said, If I have found favor in the sight of the king, let   my   life be granted to my petition, and my people to my request.  <span class="verse" rel="v0177  004" id="7  004" >4</span>
 For both I and my people are sold for destruction, and pillage, and slavery;   both   we and our children for bondmen and bondwomen: and I consented not to it, for the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        see   Heb. slanderer  </span>    is   not worthy of the king's palace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0177  005" id="7  005" >5</span>
 And the king said, Who   is   this that has dared to do this thing?  <span class="verse" rel="v0177  006" id="7  006" >6</span>
 And Esther said, the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   hostile man.  </span>  adversary   is   Aman, this wicked man. Then Aman was troubled before the king and the queen.  <span class="verse" rel="v0177  007" id="7  007" >7</span>
 And the king rose up from the banquet to go into the garden: and Aman began to entreat the queen; for he saw that he was in  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   evils.  </span>  an evil case.  <span class="verse" rel="v0177  008" id="7  008" >8</span>
 And the king returned from the garden; and Aman had fallen upon the bed, intreating the queen. And the king said, Will you even force   my   wife in my house? And when Aman heard it, he changed countenance.  <span class="verse" rel="v0177  009" id="7  009" >9</span>
 And Bugathan, one of the chamberlains, said to the king, Behold, Aman has also prepared a gallows for Mardochaeus, who spoke concerning the king, and a gallows of fifty cubits high has been set up in the premises of Aman. And the king said, Let him be  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   impaled.  </span>  hanged thereon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0177  010" id="7  010" >10</span>
 So Aman was hanged on the gallows that had been prepared for Mardochaeus: and then the king's wrath was appeased.  
<!-- 8   010 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> And in that day king Artaxerxes gave to Esther all that belonged to Aman the slanderer: and Mardochaeus was called by the king; for Esther had shown that he was related to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0178  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 And the king took the ring which he had taken away from Aman, and gave it to Mardochaeus: and Esther appointed Mardochaeus over all that had been Aman's.  <span class="verse" rel="v0178  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 And she spoke yet again to the king, and fell at his feet, and implored   him   to do away the mischief of Aman, and all that he had done against the Jews.  <span class="verse" rel="v0178  004" id="8  004" >4</span>
 Then the king stretched out to Esther the golden sceptre: and Esther arose to stand near the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0178  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 And Esther said, If it seem good to you, and I have found favor   in your sight  , let an order be sent that the letters sent by Aman may be reversed, that were written for the destruction of the Jews, who are in your kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0178  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 For how shall I be able to look upon the affliction of my people, and how shall I be able to survive the destruction of my  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   country.  </span>  kindred?  <span class="verse" rel="v0178  007" id="8  007" >7</span>
 And the king said to Esther, If I have given and freely granted you all that was Aman's, and hanged him on a gallows, because he laid his hands upon the Jews, what do you yet further seek?  <span class="verse" rel="v0178  008" id="8  008" >8</span>
 Write you° also in my name, as it seems good to you, and seal   it   with my ring: for whatever   orders   are written at the command of the king, and sealed with my ring, it is not  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   possible  </span>  lawful to gainsay them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0178  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 So the scribes were called in the first month, which is Nisan, on the three and twentieth day of the same year; and   orders   were written to the Jews, whatever   the king had   commanded to the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   stewards.  </span>  local governors and chiefs of the satraps, from India even to Ethiopia, a hundred and twenty-seven satraps, according to the several provinces, according to their dialects.  <span class="verse" rel="v0178  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 And they were written by order of the king, and sealed with his ring, and they sent the letters by the posts:  <span class="verse" rel="v0178  011" id="8  011" >11</span>
 wherein he charged them to use their   own   laws in every city, and to help each other, and to treat their adversaries, and those who attacked them, as they pleased,  <span class="verse" rel="v0178  012" id="8  012" >12</span>
 on one day in all the kingdom of Artaxerxes, on the thirteenth   day   of the twelfth month, which is Adar.  <span class="verse" rel="v0178  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 And let the copies be posted in conspicuous places throughout the kingdom, and let all the Jews be ready against this day, to fight against their enemies. And the following is the copy of the letter of the orders.  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        the passages in brackets are not in the   Hebrew. </span>  [The great king Artaxerxes sends greetings to the rulers of provinces   in   a hundred and twenty-seven satrapies, from India to Ethiopia, even to those who are faithful to our interests. Many who have been frequently honored by the most abundant kindness of their  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        perhaps rulers, see Luke 22. 25.  </span>  benefactors have conceived ambitious designs, and not only endeavor to hurt our subjects, but moreover, not being able to bear prosperity, they also endeavor to plot against their own benefactors. And they not only would utterly abolish gratitude from among men, but also, elated by the boastings of men who are strangers to all that is good, they supposed that they shall escape the sin-hating vengeance of the ever-seeing God. And oftentimes   evil   exhortation has made partakers of the guilt of shedding innocent blood, and has involved in irremediable calamities, many of those who had been appointed to offices of authority, who had been entrusted with the management of their friends' affairs; while   men  , by the false sophistry of an evil disposition, have deceived the simple candour of the ruling powers. And it is possible to see   this  , not so much from more ancient traditionary accounts, as it is immediately in your power   to see it   by examining what things have been wickedly  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   contrived.  </span>  perpetrated by the baseness of men unworthily holding power. And   it is right   to take heed with regard to the future, that we may maintain the government in undisturbed peace for all men, adopting   needful   changes, and ever judging those cases which come under our notice, with truly equitable decision. For whereas Aman, a Macedonian, the son of Amadathes, in reality an alien from the blood of the Persians, and differing widely from our mild course of government, having been hospitable entertained by us, obtained so large a share of our universal kindness, as to be called our father, and to continue the person next to the royal throne, reverenced of all;   he however  ,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   not having borne.  </span>  overcome by the pride   of his station  , endeavored to deprive us of our dominion, and our  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   spirit.  </span>  life: having by various and subtle artifices demanded for destruction both Mardochaeus our deliverer and perpetual benefactor, and Esther the blameless consort of   our   kingdom, with their whole nation. For by these methods he thought, having surprised us in a defenceless state, to transfer the dominion of the Persians to the Macedonians. But we find that the Jews, who have been consigned to destruction by the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   thrice guilty.  </span>  most abominable of men, are not malefactors, but living according to the justest laws, and being the sons of the living God, the most high and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   greatest.  </span>  mighty, who maintains the kingdom. to us as well as to our forefathers, in the most excellent order. You° will therefore do well in refusing to obey the letter sent by Aman the son of Amadathes, because he that has done these things, has been hanged with his whole family at the gates of Susa, Almighty God having swiftly returned to him a worthy recompence,   We enjoin you   then, having openly published a copy of this letter in every place, to give the Jews permission to use their own lawful customs, and to strengthen them, that on the thirteenth of the twelfth month Adar, on the self-same day, they may defend themselves against those who attack them in a time of affliction. For in the place of the destruction of the chosen race, Almighty God has granted them this   time of   gladness. Do you° therefore also, among your   notable   feasts, keep a distinct day with all festivity, that both now and hereafter it may be a day of deliverance to us and who are well disposed toward the Persians, but to those that plotted against us a memorial of destruction. And every city and province collectively, which shall not do accordingly, shall be consumed with vengeance by spear and fire: it shall be made not only inaccessible to men, but most hateful to wild beasts and birds for ever.] And let the copies be posted in conspicuous places throughout the kingdom and let all the Jews be ready against this day, to fight against their enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0178  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 So the horsemen went forth with haste to perform the king's commands; and the ordinance was also published in Susa.  <span class="verse" rel="v0178  015" id="8  015" >15</span>
 And Mardochaeus went forth robed in the royal apparel, and wearing a golden crown, and a diadem of fine purple linen: and the people in Susa saw   it   and rejoiced.  <span class="verse" rel="v0178  016" id="8  016" >16</span>
 And the Jews had light and gladness,  <span class="verse" rel="v0178  017" id="8  017" >17</span>
 in every city and province wherever the ordinance was published: wherever the proclamation took place, the Jews had joy and gladness, feasting and mirth: and many of the Gentiles were circumcised, and became Jews, for fear of the Jews.

<p><span class="chapter" id="9  001">9  </span> For in the twelfth month, on the thirteenth day of the month which is Adar, the letters written by the king arrived.  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  002" id="9  002" >2</span>
 In that day the adversaries of the Jews perished: for no one resisted, through fear of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  003" id="9  003" >3</span>
 For the chiefs of the satraps, and the princes and the royal scribes, honored the Jews; for the fear of Mardochaeus lay upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  4-5" id="9  4-5" >4-5</span>
 For the order of the king was in force, that he should be celebrated in all the kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
 And in the city Susa the Jews killed five hundred men:  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 both Pharsannes, and Delphon and Phasga,  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 and Pharadatha, and Barea, and Sarbaca,  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 and Marmasima, and Ruphaeus, and Arsaeus, and Zabuthaeus,  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  010" id="9  010" >10</span>
 the ten sons of Aman the son of Amadathes the Bugaean, the enemy of the Jews, and they plundered   their property   on the same day:  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  011" id="9  011" >11</span>
 and the number of them that perished in Susa was rendered to the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  012" id="9  012" >12</span>
 And the king said to Esther, The Jews have slain five hundred men in the city Susa; and how, think you, have they used them in the rest of the country? What then do you yet ask, that it may be   done   for you?  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  013" id="9  013" >13</span>
 And Esther said to the king, let it be granted to the Jews so to treat them tomorrow as to hand the ten sons of Aman.  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  014" id="9  014" >14</span>
 And he permitted it to be so done; and he gave up to the Jews of the city the bodies of the sons of Aman to hang.  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  015" id="9  015" >15</span>
 And the Jews assembled in Susa on the fourteenth   day   of Adar, and killed three hundred men, but plundered no property.  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  016" id="9  016" >16</span>
 And the rest of the Jews who were in the kingdom assembled, and helped one another, and obtained rest from their enemies: for they destroyed fifteen thousand of them on the thirteenth   day   of Adar, but took no spoil.  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  017" id="9  017" >17</span>
 And they rested on the fourteenth of the same month, and kept it as a day of rest with joy and gladness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  018" id="9  018" >18</span>
 And the Jews in the city Susa assembled also on the fourteenth   day   and rested; and they kept also the fifteenth with joy and gladness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  019" id="9  019" >19</span>
 On this account then   it is that   the Jews dispersed in every foreign land keep the fourteenth of Adar   as   a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   good day.  </span>  holy day with joy, sending portions each to his neighbor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  020" id="9  020" >20</span>
 And Mardochaeus wrote these things in a book, and sent them to the Jews, as many as were in the kingdom of Artaxerxes, both them that were near and them that were afar off,  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  021" id="9  021" >21</span>
 to establish these   as   joyful days, and to keep the fourteenth and fifteenth of Adar;  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  022" id="9  022" >22</span>
 for on these days the Jews obtained rest from their enemies; and   as to   the month, which was Adar, in which a change was made for them, from mourning to joy, and from sorrow to a good day, to spend the whole of it   in   good days of  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   weddings.  </span>  feasting and gladness, sending portions to their friends, and to the poor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  023" id="9  023" >23</span>
 And the Jews consented   to this   accordingly as Mardochaeus wrote to them,  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  024" id="9  024" >24</span>
    showing   how Aman the son of Amadathes the Macedonian fought against them, how he made a decree and cast  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   lot.  </span>  lots to destroy them utterly;  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  025" id="9  025" >25</span>
 also how he went in to the king, telling   him   to hang Mardochaeus: but all the calamities he tried to bring upon the Jews came upon himself, and he was hanged, and his children.  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  026" id="9  026" >26</span>
 Therefore these days were called Phrurae, because of the lots; (for in their language they are called Phrurae;) because of the words of this letter, and   because of   all they suffered on this account, and all that happened to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  027" id="9  027" >27</span>
 And   Mardochaeus   established it, and the Jews took upon themselves, and upon their seed, and upon those that were joined to them   to observe it  , neither would they on any account behave differently: but these days   were to be   a memorial kept in every generation, and city, and family, and province.  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  028" id="9  028" >28</span>
 And these days of the Phrurae,   said they,   shall be kept for ever, and their memorial shall not fail in any generation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  29-30" id="9  29-30" >29-30</span>
 And queen Esther, the daughter of Aminadab, and Mardochaeus the Jew, wrote all that they had done, and the confirmation of the letter of Phrurae.  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  031" id="9  031" >31</span>
 And Mardochaeus and Esther the queen appointed   a fast   for themselves privately, even at that time also having formed their plan against their own health.  <span class="verse" rel="v0179  032" id="9  032" >32</span>
 And Esther established it by a command for ever, and it was written for a memorial.

<p><span class="chapter" id="10  001">10  </span> And the king levied   a tax   upon   his   kingdom both by land and sea.  <span class="verse" rel="v01710  002" id="10  002" >2</span>
 And   as for   his strength and valour, and the wealth and glory of his kingdom, behold, they are written in the book of the Persians and Medes, for a memorial.  <span class="verse" rel="v01710  003" id="10  003" >3</span>
 And Mardochaeus  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   succeded to   Or,   came into the place of.  </span>  was viceroy to king Artaxerxes, and was a great man in the kingdom, and honored by the Jews, and passed his life beloved of all his nation.  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        the passages in brackets are not in the   Hebrew. </span>  [And Mardocheus said, These things have been done of God. For I remember the dream which I had concerning these matters: for not one particular of them has failed.   There was   the little fountain which became a river, and there was light, and the sun and much water. The river is Esther, whom the king married, and made queen. And the two serpents are I and Aman. And the nations are those   nations   that combined to destroy the name of the Jews. But   as for   my nation, this is Israel,   even   they that cried to God and were delivered: for the Lord delivered his people. And the Lord rescued us out of all these calamities; and God wrought such signs and great wonders as have not been done among the nations. Therefore did he ordain two lots. One for the people of God, and one for all the other   nations  . And these two lots came for an appointed season, and for a day of judgment, before God, and for all the nations. And God remembered his people, and vindicated his inheritance. And they shall observe these days in the month Adar, on the fourteenth and on the fifteenth   day   of the month, with an assembly, and joy and gladness before God, throughout the generations for ever among his people Israel. In the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemeus and Cleopatra, Dositheus, who said he was a priest and Levite, and Ptolemeus his son, brought this epistle of Phurim, which they said was the same, and that Lysimachus the son of Ptolemeus, that was in Jerusalem, had interpreted.]
