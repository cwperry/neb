<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">A</span>nd these are the words of the book, which Baruch the son of Nerias, the son of Maasias, the son of Sedecias, the son of Asadias, the son of Chelcias, wrote in Babylon,  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 In the fifth year, and in the seventh day of the month, what time as the Chaldeans took Jerusalem, and burnt it with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 And Baruch did read the words of this book in the hearing of Jechonias the son of Joachim king of Juda, and in the ears of all the people that came to hear the book,  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And in the hearing of the nobles, and of the king's sons, and in the hearing of the elders, and of all the people, from the lowest to the highest, even of all them that lived at Babylon by the river Sud.  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 Whereupon they wept, fasted, and prayed before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 They made also a collection of money according to every man's power:  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 And they sent it to Jerusalem to Joachim the high priest, the son of Chelcias, son of Salom, and to the priests, and to all the people which were found with him at Jerusalem,  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 At the same time when he received the vessels of the house of the Lord, that were carried out of the temple, to return them into the land of Juda, the tenth day of the month Sivan, namely, silver vessels, which Sedecias the son of Josias king of Jada had made,  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 After that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried away Jechonias, and the princes, and the captives, and the mighty men, and the people of the land, from Jerusalem, and brought them to Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 And they said, Behold, we have sent you money to buy you burnt offerings, and sin offerings, and incense, and prepare you° manna, and offer upon the altar of the Lord our God;  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 And pray for the life of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and for the life of Balthasar his son, that their days may be upon earth as the days of heaven:  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 And the Lord will give us strength, and lighten our eyes, and we shall live under the shadow of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and under the shadow of Balthasar his son, and we shall serve them many days, and find favor in their sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 Pray for us also to the Lord our God, for we have sinned against the Lord our God; and to this day the fury of the Lord and his wrath is not turned from us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 And you° shall read this book which we have sent to you, to make confession in the house of the Lord, upon the feasts and solemn days.  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 And you° shall say, To the Lord our God belongs righteousness, but to us the confusion of faces, as it is come to pass this day, to them of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 And to our kings, and to our princes, and to our priests, and to our prophets, and to our fathers:  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 For we have sinned before the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 And disobeyed him, and have not listened to the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in the commandments that he gave us openly:  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 Since the day that the Lord brought our forefathers out of the land of Egypt, to this present day, we have been disobedient to the Lord our God, and we have been negligent in not hearing his voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 Therefore the evils cleaved to us, and the curse, which the Lord appointed by Moses his servant at the time that he brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt, to give us a land that flows with milk and honey, like as it is to see this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  021" id="1  021" >21</span>
 Nevertheless we have not listened to the voice of the Lord our God, according to all the words of the prophets, whom he sent to us:  <span class="verse" rel="v0441  022" id="1  022" >22</span>
 But every man followed the imagination of his own wicked heart, to serve strange gods, and to do evil in the sight of the Lord our God.  
<!-- 2   022 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> Therefore the Lord has made good his word, which he pronounced against us, and against our judges that judged Israel, and against our kings, and against our princes, and against the men of Israel and Juda,  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 To bring upon us great plagues, such as never happened under the whole heaven, as it came to pass in Jerusalem, according to the things that were written in the law of Moses;  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 That a man should eat the flesh of his own son, and the flesh of his own daughter.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 Moreover he has delivered them to be in subjection to all the kingdoms that are round about us, to be as a reproach and desolation among all the people round about, where the Lord has scattered them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 Thus we were cast down, and not exalted, because we have sinned against the Lord our God, and have not been obedient to his voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 To the Lord our God appertains righteousness: but to us and to our fathers open shame, as appears this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 For all these plagues are come upon us, which the Lord has pronounced against us  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 Yet have we not prayed before the Lord, that we might turn every one from the imaginations of his wicked heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 Therefore the Lord watched over us for evil, and the Lord has brought it upon us: for the Lord is righteous in all his works which he has commanded us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 Yet we have not listened to his voice, to walk in the commandments of the Lord, that he has set before us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 And now, O Lord God of Israel, that have brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and high arm, and with signs, and with wonders, and with great power, and have gotten yourself a name, as appears this day:  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 O Lord our God, we have sinned, we have done ungodly, we have dealt unrighteously in all your ordinances.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 Let your wrath turn from us: for we are but a few left among the heathen, where you have scattered us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 Hear our prayers, O Lord, and our petitions, and deliver us for your own sake, and give us favor in the sight of them which have led us away:  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 That all the earth may know that you are the Lord our God, because Israel and his posterity is called by your name.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 O Lord, look down from your holy house, and consider us: bow down your ear, O Lord, to hear us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 Open your eyes, and behold; for the dead that are in the graves, whose souls are taken from their bodies, will give to the Lord neither praise nor righteousness:  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 But the soul that is greatly vexed, which goes stooping and feeble, and the eyes that fail, and the hungry soul, will give you praise and righteousness, O Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 Therefore we do not make our humble supplication before you, O Lord our God, for the righteousness of our fathers, and of our kings.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 For you have sent out your wrath and indignation upon us, as you have spoken by your servants the prophets, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 Thus says the Lord, Bow down your shoulders to serve the king of Babylon: so shall you° remain in the land that I gave to your fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 But if you° will not hear the voice of the Lord, to serve the king of Babylon,  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  023" id="2  023" >23</span>
 I will cause to cease out of the cites of Judah, and from without Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: and the whole land shall be desolate of inhabitants.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  024" id="2  024" >24</span>
 But we would not listen to your voice, to serve the king of Babylon: therefore have you made good the words that you spoke by your servants the prophets, namely, that the bones of our kings, and the bones of our fathers, should be taken out of their place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  025" id="2  025" >25</span>
 And, behold, they are cast out to the heat of the day, and to the frost of the night, and they died in great miseries by famine, by sword, and by pestilence.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  026" id="2  026" >26</span>
 And the house which is called by your name have you laid waste, as it is to be seen this day, for the wickedness of the house of Israel and the house of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  027" id="2  027" >27</span>
 O Lord our God, you have dealt with us after all your goodness, and according to all that great mercy of your,  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  028" id="2  028" >28</span>
 As you spoke by your servant Moses in the day when you did command him to write the law before the children of Israel, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  029" id="2  029" >29</span>
 If you° will not hear my voice, surely this very great multitude shall be turned into a small number among the nations, where I will scatter them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  030" id="2  030" >30</span>
 For I knew that they would not hear me, because it is a stiff-necked people: but in the land of their captivities they shall remember themselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  031" id="2  031" >31</span>
 And shall know that I am the Lord their God: for I will give them an heart, and ears to hear:  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  032" id="2  032" >32</span>
 And they shall praise me in the land of their captivity, and think upon my name,  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  033" id="2  033" >33</span>
 And return from their stiff neck, and from their wicked deeds: for they shall remember the way of their fathers, which sinned before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  034" id="2  034" >34</span>
 And I will bring them again into the land which I promised with an oath to their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and they shall be lords of it: and I will increase them, and they shall not be diminished.  <span class="verse" rel="v0442  035" id="2  035" >35</span>
 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them to be their God, and they shall be my people: and I will no more drive my people of Israel out of the land that I have given them.

<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> O Lord Almighty, God of Israel, the soul in anguish the troubled spirit, cries to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 Hear, O Lord, and have mercy; for you are merciful: and have pity upon us, because we have sinned before you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 For you endure for ever, and we perish utterly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 O Lord Almighty, you God of Israel, hear now the prayers of the dead Israelites, and of their children, which have sinned before you, and not listened to the voice of you their God: for the which cause these plagues cleave to us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 Remember not the iniquities of our forefathers: but think upon your power and your name now at this time.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 For you are the Lord our God, and you, O Lord, will we praise.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 And for this cause you have put your fear in our hearts, to the intent that we should call upon your name, and praise you in our captivity: for we have called to mind all the iniquity of our forefathers, that sinned before you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 Behold, we are yet this day in our captivity, where you have scattered us, for a reproach and a curse, and to be subject to payments, according to all the iniquities of our fathers, which departed from the Lord our God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 Hear, Israel, the commandments of life: give ear to understand wisdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 How is it Israel, that you are in your enemies' land, that you have become old in a strange country, that you are defiled with the dead,  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 That you are counted with them that go down into the grave?  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 You have forsaken the fountain of wisdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 For if you had walked in the way of God, you should have dwelled in peace for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 Learn where is wisdom, where is strength, where is understanding; that you may know also where is length of days, and life, where is the light of the eyes, and peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 Who has found out her place? or who has come into her treasures?  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 Where are the princes of the heathen become, and such as ruled the beasts upon the earth;  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 They that had their pastime with the fowls of the air, and they that hoarded up silver and gold, wherein men trust, and made no end of their getting?  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 For they that wrought in silver, and were so careful, and whose works are unsearchable,  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  019" id="3  019" >19</span>
 They are vanished and gone down to the grave, and others are come up in their steads.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  020" id="3  020" >20</span>
 Young men have seen light, and lived upon the earth: but the way of knowledge have they not known,  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  021" id="3  021" >21</span>
 Nor understood the paths thereof, nor laid hold of it: their children were far off from that way.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  022" id="3  022" >22</span>
 It has not been heard of in Chanaan, neither has it been seen in Theman.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  023" id="3  023" >23</span>
 The Agarenes that seek wisdom upon earth, the merchants of Meran and of Theman, the authors of fables, and searchers out of understanding; none of these have known the way of wisdom, or remember her paths.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  024" id="3  024" >24</span>
 O Israel, how great is the house of God! and how large is the place of his possession!  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  025" id="3  025" >25</span>
 Great, and has none end; high, and unmeasurable.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  026" id="3  026" >26</span>
 There were the giants famous from the beginning, that were of so great stature, and so expert in war.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  027" id="3  027" >27</span>
 Those did not the Lord choose, neither gave he the way of knowledge to them:  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  028" id="3  028" >28</span>
 But they were destroyed, because they had no wisdom, and perished through their own foolishness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  029" id="3  029" >29</span>
 Who has gone up into heaven, and taken her, and brought her down from the clouds?  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  030" id="3  030" >30</span>
 Who has gone over the sea, and found her, and will bring her for pure gold?  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  031" id="3  031" >31</span>
 No man knows her way, nor thinks of her path.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  032" id="3  032" >32</span>
 But he that knows all things knows her, and has found her out with his understanding: he that prepared the earth for evermore has filled it with four-footed beasts:  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  033" id="3  033" >33</span>
 He that sends forth light, and it goes, calls it again, and it obeys him with fear.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  034" id="3  034" >34</span>
 The stars shined in their watches, and rejoiced: when he calls them, they say, Here we be; and so with cheerfulness they showed light to him that made them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  035" id="3  035" >35</span>
 This is our God, and there shall none other be accounted of in comparison of him  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  036" id="3  036" >36</span>
 He has found out all the way of knowledge, and has given it to Jacob his servant, and to Israel his beloved.  <span class="verse" rel="v0443  037" id="3  037" >37</span>
 Afterward did he show himself upon earth, and conversed with men.

<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> This is the book of the commandments of God, and the law that endures for ever: all they that keep it shall come to life; but such as leave it shall die.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 Turn you, O Jacob, and take hold of it: walk in the presence of the light thereof, that you may be illuminated.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 Give not your honor to another, nor the things that are profitable to you to a strange nation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 O Israel, happy are we: for things that are pleasing to God are made known to us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  005" id="4  005" >5</span>
 Be of good cheer, my people, the memorial of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 You° were sold to the nations, not for   your   destruction: but because you° moved God to wrath, you° were delivered to the enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 For you° provoked him that made you by sacrificing to devils, and not to God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 You° have forgotten the everlasting God, that brought you up; and you° have grieved Jerusalem, that nursed you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 For when she saw the wrath of God coming upon you, she said, Listen, O you° that dwell about Sion: God has brought upon me great mourning;  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 For I saw the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting brought upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 With joy did I nourish them; but sent them away with weeping and mourning.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 Let no man rejoice over me, a widow, and forsaken of many, who for the sins of my children am left desolate; because they departed from the law of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 They knew not his statutes, nor walked in the ways of his commandments, nor trod in the paths of discipline in his righteousness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  014" id="4  014" >14</span>
 Let them that dwell about Sion come, and remember you° the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting has brought upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  015" id="4  015" >15</span>
 For he has brought a nation upon them from far, a shameless nation, and of a strange language, who neither reverenced old man, nor pitied child.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  016" id="4  016" >16</span>
 These have carried away the dear beloved children of the widow, and left her that was alone desolate without daughters.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  017" id="4  017" >17</span>
 But what can I help you?  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  018" id="4  018" >18</span>
 For he that brought these plagues upon you will deliver you from the hands of your enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  019" id="4  019" >19</span>
 Go your way, O my children, go your way: for I am left desolate.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  020" id="4  020" >20</span>
 I have put off the clothing of peace, and put upon me the sackcloth of my prayer: I will cry to the Everlasting in my days.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  021" id="4  021" >21</span>
 Be of good cheer, O my children, cry to the Lord, and he will deliver you from the power and hand of the enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  022" id="4  022" >22</span>
 For my hope is in the Everlasting, that he will save you; and joy is come to me from the Holy One, because of the mercy which shall soon come to you from the Everlasting our Saviour.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  023" id="4  023" >23</span>
 For I sent you out with mourning and weeping: but God will give you to me again with joy and gladness for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  024" id="4  024" >24</span>
 Like as now the neighbors of Sion have seen your captivity: so shall they see shortly your salvation from our God which shall come upon you with great glory, and brightness of the Everlasting.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  025" id="4  025" >25</span>
 My children, suffer patiently the wrath that is come upon you from God: for your enemy has persecuted you; but shortly you shall see his destruction, and shall tread upon his neck.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  026" id="4  026" >26</span>
 My delicate ones have gone rough ways, and were taken away as a flock caught of the enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  027" id="4  027" >27</span>
 Be of good comfort, O my children, and cry to God: for you° shall be remembered of him that brought these things upon you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  028" id="4  028" >28</span>
 For as it was your mind to go astray from God: so, being returned, seek him ten times more.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  029" id="4  029" >29</span>
 For he that has brought these plagues upon you shall bring you everlasting joy with your salvation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  030" id="4  030" >30</span>
 Take a good heart, O Jerusalem: for he that gave you that name will comfort you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  031" id="4  031" >31</span>
 Miserable are they that afflicted you, and rejoiced at your fall.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  032" id="4  032" >32</span>
 Miserable are the cities which your children served: miserable is she that received your sons.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  033" id="4  033" >33</span>
 For as she rejoiced at your ruin, and was glad of your fall: so shall she be grieved for her own desolation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  034" id="4  034" >34</span>
 For I will take away the rejoicing of her great multitude, and her pride shall be turned into mourning.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  035" id="4  035" >35</span>
 For fire shall come upon her from the Everlasting, long to endure; and she shall be inhabited of devils for a great time.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  036" id="4  036" >36</span>
 O Jerusalem, look about you toward the east, and behold the joy that comes to you from God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0444  037" id="4  037" >37</span>
 Behold, your sons come, whom you sent away, they come gathered together from the east to the west by the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the glory of God.

<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> Put off, O Jerusalem, the garment of mourning and affliction, and put on the comeliness of the glory that comes from God for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0445  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 Cast about you a double garment of the righteousness which comes from God; and set a diadem on your head of the glory of the Everlasting.  <span class="verse" rel="v0445  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 For God will show your brightness to every country under heaven.  <span class="verse" rel="v0445  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 For your name shall be called of God for ever The peace of righteousness, and The glory of God's worship.  <span class="verse" rel="v0445  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 Arise, O Jerusalem, and stand on high, and look about toward the east, and behold your children gathered from the west to the east by the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the remembrance of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0445  006" id="5  006" >6</span>

 For God has appointed that every high hill, and banks of long continuance, should be cast down, and valleys filled up, to make even the ground, that Israel may go safely in the glory of God,  <span class="verse" rel="v0445  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 Moreover even the woods and every sweet smelling tree shall overshadow Israel by the commandment of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0445  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 For God shall lead Israel with joy in the light of his glory with the mercy and righteousness that comes from him.
