<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">T</span>here was a certain man in the land of Ausis, whose name   was   Job; and than man was true, blameless, righteous,   and   godly, abstaining from everything evil.  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 And he had seven sons and three daughters.  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 And his cattle consisted of seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred she-asses in the pastures, and a very great household, and he had a great husbandry on the earth; and that man was   most   noble of the   men   of the east.  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And his sons visiting one another prepared a banquet every day, taking with them also their three sisters to eat and drink with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 And when the days of the banquet were completed, Job sent and purified them, having risen up in the morning, and offered sacrifices for them, according to their number, and one calf for a sin-offering for their souls: for Job said, Lest perhaps my sons have thought evil in their minds against God. Thus, then Job did continually.  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 And it came to pass on a day, that behold, the angels of God came to stand before the Lord, and the devil came with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 And the Lord said to the devil, Whence are you come? And the devil answered the Lord, and said, I am come from compassing the earth, and walking up and down in the world.  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 And the Lord said to him, Hast you diligently considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a man blameless, true, godly, abstaining from everything evil?  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 Then the devil answered, and said before the Lord, Does Job worship the Lord for nothing?  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 Hast you not made a hedge about him, and about his household, and all his possessions round about? and have you not blessed the works of his hands, and multiplied his cattle upon the land?  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 But put forth your hand, and touch all that he has: verily he will bless you to   your   face.  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 Then the Lord said to the devil, Behold, I give into your hand all that he has, but touch not himself. So the devil went out from the presence of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 And it came to pass on a certain day, that Job's sons and his daughters were drinking wine in the house of their elder brother.  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 And, behold, there came a messenger to Job, and said to him, The yokes of oxen were plowing, and the she-asses were feeding near them;  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 and the spoilers came and took them for a prey, and killed the servants with the sword; and I having escaped alone am come to tell you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 While he was yet speaking, there came another messenger, and said to Job, Fire has fallen from heaven, and burnt up the sheep, and devoured the shepherds like wise; and I having escaped alone am come to tell you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 While he was yet speaking, there came another messenger, and said to Job, The horsemen formed three companies against us, and surrounded the camels, and took them for a prey, and killed the servants with the sword; and I only escaped, and am come to tell you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 While he is yet speaking, another messenger comes, saying to Job, While your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking with their elder brother,  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 suddenly a great wind came on from the desert, and caught the four corners of the house, and the house fell upon your children, and they are dead; and I have escaped alone, and am come to tell you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 So Job arose, and tore his garments, and shaved the hair of his head, and fell on the earth, and worshipped,  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  021" id="1  021" >21</span>
 and said, I myself came forth naked from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return there; the Lord gave, the Lord has taken away: as it seemed good to the Lord, so has it come to pass; blessed be the name of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0181  022" id="1  022" >22</span>
 In all these events that befell him Job sinned not at all before the Lord, and did not impute folly to God.  
<!-- 2   022 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> And it came to pass on a certain day, that the angels of God came to stand before the Lord, and the devil came among them to stand before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0182  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 And the Lord, said to the devil, Whence come you? Then the devil said before the Lord, I am come from going through the world, and walking about the whole earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0182  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 And the Lord said to the devil, Hast you then observed my servant Job, that there is none of   men   upon the earth like him, a harmless, true, blameless, godly man, abstaining from all evil? and he yet cleaves to innocence, whereas you have told   me   to destroy his substance without cause?  <span class="verse" rel="v0182  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 And the devil answered and said to the Lord, Skin for skin, all that a man has will he give as a ransom for his life.  <span class="verse" rel="v0182  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 Nay, but put forth your hand, and touch his bones and his flesh: verily he will bless you to   your   face.  <span class="verse" rel="v0182  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 And the Lord said to the devil, Behold, I deliver him up to you; only save his life.  <span class="verse" rel="v0182  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 So the devil went out from the Lord, and struck Job with sore boils from   his   feet to   his   head.  <span class="verse" rel="v0182  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 And he took a potsherd to scrape away the discharge, and sat upon a dung-heap outside the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0182  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 And when much time had passed, his wife said to him, How long will you hold out, saying, Behold, I wait yet a little while, expecting the hope of my deliverance? for, behold, your memorial is abolished from the earth,   even your   sons and daughters, the pangs and pains of my womb which I bore in vain with sorrows; and you yourself sit down to spend the nights in the open air among the corruption of worms, and I am a wanderer and a servant from place to place and house to house, waiting for the setting of the sun, that I may rest from my labors and my pangs which now beset me: but say some word against the Lord, and die.  <span class="verse" rel="v0182  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 But he looked on her, and said to her, You have spoken like one of the foolish women. If we have received good things of the hand of the Lord, shall we not endure evil things? In all these things that happened to him, Job sinned not at all with his lips before God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0182  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 Now his three friends having heard of all the evil that was come upon him, came to him each from his own country: Eliphaz the king of the Thaemans, Baldad sovereign of the Saucheans, Sophar king of he Minaeans: and they came to him with one accord, to comfort and to visit him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0182  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 And when they saw him from a distance they did not know him; and they cried with a loud voice, and wept, and tore every one his garment, and sprinkled dust upon   their heads  ,  <span class="verse" rel="v0182  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 and they sat down beside him seven days and seven nights, and no one of them spoke; for they saw that his affliction was dreadful and very great.

<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day,  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 Let the day perish in which I was born, and that night in which they said, Behold a boy!  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 Let that night be darkness, and let not the Lord regard it from above, neither let light come upon it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 But let darkness and the shadow of death seize it; let blackness come upon it;  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 let that day and night be cursed, let darkness carry them away; let it not come into the days of the year, neither let it be numbered with the days of the months.  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 But let that night be pain, and let not mirth come upon it, nor joy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 But let him that curses that day curse it,   even   he that is ready to attack the great whale.  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 Let the stars of that night be darkened; let it remain   dark  , and not come into light; and let it not see the morning star arise:  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 because it shut not up the gates of my mother's womb, for   so   it would have removed sorrow from my eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 For why died I not in the belly? and   why   did I not come forth from the womb and die immediately?  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 and why did the knees support me? and why did I suck the breasts?  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 Now I should have lain down and been quiet, I should have slept and been at rest,  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 with kings   and   councillors of the earth, who gloried in   their   swords;  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 or with rulers, whose gold was abundant, who filled their houses with silver:  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 or   I should have been   as an untimely birth proceeding from his mother's womb, or as infants who never saw light.  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 There the ungodly have burnt out the fury of rage; there the wearied in body rest.  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 And the men of old time have together ceased to hear the exactor's voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  019" id="3  019" >19</span>
 The small and great are there, and the servant that feared his lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  020" id="3  020" >20</span>
 For why is light given to those who are in bitterness, and life to those souls which are in griefs?  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  021" id="3  021" >21</span>
 who desire death, and obtain it not, digging   for it   as   for   treasures;  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  022" id="3  022" >22</span>
 and would be very joyful if they should gain it?  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  023" id="3  023" >23</span>
 Death   is   rest to   such   a man, for God has hedged him in.  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  024" id="3  024" >24</span>
 For my groaning comes before my food, and I weep being beset with terror.  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  025" id="3  025" >25</span>
 For the terror of which I meditated has come upon me, and that which I had feared has befallen me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0183  026" id="3  026" >26</span>
 I was not at peace, nor quiet, nor had I rest; yet wrath came upon me.  
<!-- 4   026 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> Then Eliphaz the Thaemanite answered and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 Hast you been often spoken to in distress? but who shall endure the force of your words?  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 For whereas you have instructed many, and have strengthened the hands of the weak one,  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 and have supported the failing with words, and have imparted courage to feeble knees.  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  005" id="4  005" >5</span>
 Yet now   that   pain has come upon you, and touched you, you are troubled.  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 Is not your fear   founded   in folly, your hope also, and the mischief of your way?  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 Remember then who has perished, being pure? or when were the true-hearted utterly destroyed?  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 Accordingly as I have seen men plowing barren places, and they that sow them will reap sorrows for themselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 They shall perish by the command of the Lord, and shall be utterly consumed by the breath of his wrath.  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 The strength of the lion, and the voice of the lioness, and the exulting cry of serpents are quenched.  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 The old lion has perished for lack of food, and the lions' whelps have forsaken one another.  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 But if there had been any truth in your words, none of these evils would have befallen you. Shall not my ear receive excellent   revelations   from him?  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 But   as when   terror falls upon men, with dread and a sound in the night,  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  014" id="4  014" >14</span>
 horror and trembling seized me, and caused all my bones greatly to shake.  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  015" id="4  015" >15</span>
 And a spirit came before my face; and my hair and flesh quivered.  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  016" id="4  016" >16</span>
 I arose and perceived it not: I looked, and there, was no form before my eyes: but I only heard a breath and a voice,   saying  ,  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  017" id="4  017" >17</span>
 What, shall a mortal be pure before the Lord? or a man be blameless in regard to his works?  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  018" id="4  018" >18</span>
 Whereas he trust not in his servants, and perceives perverseness in his angels.  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  019" id="4  019" >19</span>
 But   as for   them that dwell in houses of clay, of whom we also are formed of the same clay, he smites them like a moth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  020" id="4  020" >20</span>
 And from the morning to evening they no longer exist: they have perished, because they can’t help themselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v0184  021" id="4  021" >21</span>
 For he blows upon them, and they are withered: they have perished for lack of wisdom.

<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> But call, if any one will listen to you, or if you shall see any of the holy angels.  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 For wrath destroys the foolish one, and envy slays him that has gone astray.  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 And I have seen foolish ones taking root: but suddenly their habitation was devoured.  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 Let their children be far from safety, and let them be crushed at the doors of vile men, and let there be no deliverer.  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 For what they have collected, the just shall eat; but they shall not be delivered out of calamities: let their strength be utterly exhausted.  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 For labor can’t by any means come out of the earth, nor shall trouble spring out of the mountains:  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 yet man is born to labor, and   even so   the vulture's young seek the high places.  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 Nevertheless I will beseech the Lord, and will call upon the Lord, the sovereign of all;  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 who does great things and untraceable, glorious things also, and marvelous, of which there is no number:  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 who gives rain upon the earth, sending water on the earth:  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  011" id="5  011" >11</span>
 who exalts the lowly, and raises up them that are lost:  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  012" id="5  012" >12</span>
 frustrating the counsels of the crafty, and their hands shall not perform the truth:  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  013" id="5  013" >13</span>
 who takes the wise in their wisdom, and subverts the counsel of the crafty  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 In the day darkness shall come upon them, and let them grope in the noon-day even as in the night:  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  015" id="5  015" >15</span>
 and let them perish in war, and let the weak escape from the hand of the mighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  016" id="5  016" >16</span>
 And let the weak have hope, but the mouth of the unjust be stopped.  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  017" id="5  017" >17</span>
 But blessed   is   the man whom the Lord has reproved; and reject not you the chastening of the Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  018" id="5  018" >18</span>
 for he causes   a man   to be in pain, and restores   him   again: he smites, and his hands heal.  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  019" id="5  019" >19</span>
 Six time he shall deliver you out of distresses: and in the seventh harm shall not touch you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  020" id="5  020" >20</span>
 In famine he shall deliver you from death: and in war he shall free you from the power of the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  021" id="5  021" >21</span>
 He shall hide you from the scourge of the tongue: and you shall not be afraid of coming evils.  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  022" id="5  022" >22</span>
 You shall laugh at the unrighteous and the lawless: and you shall not be afraid of wild beasts.  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  023" id="5  023" >23</span>
 For the wild beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  024" id="5  024" >24</span>
 Then shall you know that your house shall be at peace, and the provision for your tabernacle shall not fail.  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  025" id="5  025" >25</span>
 And you shall know that your seed   shall be   abundant; and your children shall be like the herbage of the field.  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  026" id="5  026" >26</span>
 And you shall come to the grave like ripe corn reaped in its season, or as a heap of the corn-flour collected in proper time.  <span class="verse" rel="v0185  027" id="5  027" >27</span>
 Behold, we have thus sought out these matters; these are what we have heard: but do you reflect with yourself, if you have done anything   wrong  .

<p><span class="chapter" id="6  001">6  </span> But Job answered and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  002" id="6  002" >2</span>
 Oh that one would indeed weigh the wrath that is upon me, and take up my griefs in a balance together!  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  003" id="6  003" >3</span>
 And verily they would be heavier than the sand by the seashore: but, as it seems, my words are vain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  004" id="6  004" >4</span>
 For the arrows of the Lord are in my body, whose violence drinks up my blood: whenever I am going to speak, they pierce me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  005" id="6  005" >5</span>
 What then? will the wild ass bray for nothing, if he is not seeking food? or again, will the ox low at the manger, when he has a fodder?  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  006" id="6  006" >6</span>
 Shall bread be eaten without salt? or again, is there taste in empty words?  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  007" id="6  007" >7</span>
 For my wrath can’t cease; for I perceive my food as the smell of a lion   to be   loathsome.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  008" id="6  008" >8</span>
 For oh that he would grant   my desire  , and my petition might come, and the Lord would grant my hope!  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  009" id="6  009" >9</span>
 Let the Lord begin and wound me, but let him not utterly destroy me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  010" id="6  010" >10</span>
 Let the grave be my city, upon the walls of which I have leaped: I will not shrink from it; for I have not denied the holy words of my God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  011" id="6  011" >11</span>
 For what is my strength, that I continue? what is my time, that my soul endures?  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  012" id="6  012" >12</span>
 Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  013" id="6  013" >13</span>
 Or have I not trusted in him? but help is   far   from me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  014" id="6  014" >14</span>
 Mercy has rejected me; and the visitation of the Lord has disregarded me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  015" id="6  015" >15</span>
 My nearest relations have not regarded me; they have passed me by like a failing brook, or like a wave.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  016" id="6  016" >16</span>
 They who used to reverence me, now have come against me like snow or congealed ice.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  017" id="6  017" >17</span>
 When it has melted at the approach of heat, it is not known what it was.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  018" id="6  018" >18</span>
 Thus I also have been deserted of all; and I am ruined, and become an outcast.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  019" id="6  019" >19</span>
 Behold the ways of the Thaemanites, you° that mark the paths of the Sabaeans.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  020" id="6  020" >20</span>
 They too that trust in cities and riches shall come to shame.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  021" id="6  021" >21</span>
 But you° also have come to me without pity; so that beholding my wound you° are afraid.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  022" id="6  022" >22</span>
 What? have I made any demand of you? or do I ask for strength from you,  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  023" id="6  023" >23</span>
 to deliver me from enemies, or to rescue me from the hand of the mighty ones?  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  024" id="6  024" >24</span>
 Teach you° me, and I will be silent: if in anything I have erred, tell me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  025" id="6  025" >25</span>
 But as it seems, the words of a true man are vain, because I do not ask strength of you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  026" id="6  026" >26</span>
 Neither will your reproof cause me to cease my words, for neither will I endure the sound of your speech.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  027" id="6  027" >27</span>
 Even because you° attack the fatherless, and insult your friend.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  028" id="6  028" >28</span>
 But now, having looked upon your countenances, I will not lie.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  029" id="6  029" >29</span>
 Sit down now, and let there not be unrighteousness; and unite again with the just.  <span class="verse" rel="v0186  030" id="6  030" >30</span>
 For there is no injustice in my tongue; and does not my throat meditate understanding?

<p><span class="chapter" id="7  001">7  </span> Is not the life of man upon earth a state of trial? and his existence as that of a hireling by the day?  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  002" id="7  002" >2</span>
 Or as a servant that fears his master, and one who has grasped a shadow? or as a hireling waiting for his pay?  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  003" id="7  003" >3</span>
 So have I also endured months of vanity, and nights of pain have been appointed me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  004" id="7  004" >4</span>
 Whenever I lie down, I say, When   will it be   day? and whenever I rise up, again   I say   when   will it be   evening? and I am full of pains from evening to morning.  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  005" id="7  005" >5</span>
 And my body is covered with loathsome worms; and I waste away, scraping off clods of dust from my eruption.  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  006" id="7  006" >6</span>
 And my life is lighter than a word, and has perished in vain hope.  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  007" id="7  007" >7</span>
 Remember then that my life is breath, and my eye shall not yet again see good.  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  008" id="7  008" >8</span>
 The eye of him that sees me shall not see me   again  : your eyes are upon me, and I am no more.  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  009" id="7  009" >9</span>
    I am   as a cloud that is cleared away from the sky: for if a man go down to the grave, he shall not come up again:  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  010" id="7  010" >10</span>
 and he shall surely not return to his own house, neither shall his place know him any more.  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  011" id="7  011" >11</span>
 Then neither will I refrain my mouth: I will speak being in distress; being in anguish I will disclose the bitterness of my soul.  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  012" id="7  012" >12</span>
 Am I a sea, or a serpent, that you have set a watch over me?  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  013" id="7  013" >13</span>
 I said that my bed should comfort me, and I would privately counsel with myself on my couch.  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  014" id="7  014" >14</span>
 You scare me with dreams, and do terrify me with visions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  015" id="7  015" >15</span>
 You will separate life from my spirit; and yet   keep   my bones from death.  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  016" id="7  016" >16</span>
 For I shall not live for ever, that I should patiently endure: depart from me, for my life   is   vain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  017" id="7  017" >17</span>
 For what is man, that you have magnified him? or that you give heed to him?  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  018" id="7  018" >18</span>
 Will you visit him till the morning, and judge him till   the time of   rest?  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  019" id="7  019" >19</span>
 How long do you not let me alone, nor let me go, until I shall swallow down my spittle?  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  020" id="7  020" >20</span>
 If I have sinned, what shall I be able to do, O you that understand the mind of men? why have you made me as your accuser, and   why   am I a burden to you?  <span class="verse" rel="v0187  021" id="7  021" >21</span>
 Why have you not forgotten my iniquity, and purged my sin? but now I shall depart to the earth; and in the morning I am no more.

<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> Then Baldad the Sauchite answered, and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 How long will you speak these things,   how long shall   the breath of your mouth   be   abundant in words?  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 Will the Lord be unjust when he judges; or will he that has made all things pervert justice?  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  004" id="8  004" >4</span>
 If your sons have sinned before him, he has cast them away because of their transgression.  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 But be you early in prayer to the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 If you are pure and true, he will listen to your supplication, and will restore to you the habitation of righteousness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  007" id="8  007" >7</span>
 Though then your beginning should be small, yet your end should be unspeakably great.  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  008" id="8  008" >8</span>
 For ask of the former generation, and search diligently among the race of   our   fathers:  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 (for we are of yesterday, and know nothing; for our life upon the earth is a shadow:)  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 shall not these teach you, and report   to you  , and bring out words from   their   heart?  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  011" id="8  011" >11</span>
 Does the rush flourish without water, or shall the flag grow up without moisture?  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  012" id="8  012" >12</span>
 When it is yet on the root, and   though   it has not been cut down, does not any herb wither before it has received moisture?  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 Thus then shall be the end of all that forget the Lord: for the hope of the ungodly shall perish.  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 For his house shall be without inhabitants, and his tent shall prove a spider's web.  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  015" id="8  015" >15</span>
 If he should prop up his house, it shall not stand: and when he has taken hold of it, it shall not remain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  016" id="8  016" >16</span>
 For it is moist under the sun, and his branch shall come forth out of his dung-heap.  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  017" id="8  017" >17</span>
 He lies down upon a gathering of stones, and shall live in the mist of flints.  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  018" id="8  018" >18</span>
 If   God   should destroy   him  , his place shall deny him. Hast you not seen such things,  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  019" id="8  019" >19</span>
 that such is the overthrow of the ungodly? and out of the earth another shall grow.  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  020" id="8  020" >20</span>
 For the Lord will by no means reject the harmless man; but he will not receive any gift of the ungodly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  021" id="8  021" >21</span>
 But he will fill with laughter the mouth of the sincere, and their lips with thanksgiving.  <span class="verse" rel="v0188  022" id="8  022" >22</span>
 But their adversaries shall clothe themselves with shame; and the habitation of the ungodly shall perish.

<p><span class="chapter" id="9  001">9  </span> Then Job answered and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  002" id="9  002" >2</span>
 I know of a truth that it is so: for how shall a mortal man be just before the Lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  003" id="9  003" >3</span>
 For if he would enter into judgment with him,   God   would not listen to him, so that he should answer to one of his charges of a thousand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  004" id="9  004" >4</span>
 For he is wise in mind, and mighty, and great: who has hardened himself against him and endured?  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  005" id="9  005" >5</span>
 Who wears out the mountains, and   men   know it not: who overturns them in anger.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
 Who shakes the   earth   under heaven from its foundations, and its pillars totter.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 Who commands the sun, and it rises not; and he seals up the stars.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 Who alone has stretched out the heavens, and walks on the sea as on firm ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 Who makes Pleias, and Hesperus, and Arcturus, and the chambers of the south.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  010" id="9  010" >10</span>
 Who does great and unsearchable things; glorious also and excellent things, innumerable.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  011" id="9  011" >11</span>
 If ever he should go beyond me, I shall not see him: if he should pass by me, neither thus have I known   it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  012" id="9  012" >12</span>
 If he would take away, who shall turn him back? or who shall say to him, What have you done?  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  013" id="9  013" >13</span>
 For   if   he has turned away   his   anger, the whales under heaven have stooped under him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  014" id="9  014" >14</span>
 Oh then that he would listen to me, or judge my cause.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  015" id="9  015" >15</span>
 For though I be righteous, he will not listen to me: I will entreat his judgment.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  016" id="9  016" >16</span>
 And if I should call and he should not listen, I can’t believe that he has listened to my voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  017" id="9  017" >17</span>
 Let him not crush me with a dark storm: but he has made by bruises many without cause.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  018" id="9  018" >18</span>
 For he suffers me not to take breath, but he has filled me with bitterness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  019" id="9  019" >19</span>
 For indeed he is strong in power: who then shall resist his judgment?  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  020" id="9  020" >20</span>
 For though I should seem righteous, my mouth will be profane: and though I should seem blameless, I shall be proved perverse.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  021" id="9  021" >21</span>
 For even if I have sinned, I know it not   in   my soul: but my life is taken away.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  022" id="9  022" >22</span>
 Therefore I said, Wrath slays the great and mighty man.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  023" id="9  023" >23</span>
 For the worthless die, but the righteous are laughed to scorn.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  024" id="9  024" >24</span>
 For they are delivered into the hands of the unrighteous   man  : he covers the faces of the judges   of the earth  : but if it be not he, who is it?  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  025" id="9  025" >25</span>
 But my life is swifter than a post:   my days   have fled away, and they knew it not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  026" id="9  026" >26</span>
 Or again, is there a trace of   their   path   left   by ships? or is there one of the flying eagle as it seeks   its   prey?  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  027" id="9  027" >27</span>
 And if I should say, I will forget to speak, I will bow down my face and groan;  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  028" id="9  028" >28</span>
 I quake in all my limbs, for I know that you will not leave me alone   as   innocent.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  029" id="9  029" >29</span>
 But since I am ungodly, why have I not died?  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  030" id="9  030" >30</span>
 For if I should wash myself with snow, and purge myself with pure hands,  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  031" id="9  031" >31</span>
 you had thoroughly plunged me in filth, and my garment had abhorred me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  032" id="9  032" >32</span>
 For you are not man like me, with whom I could contend, that we might come together to judgment.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  033" id="9  033" >33</span>
 Would that   he   our mediator were   present  , and a reprover, and one who should hear   the cause   between both.  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  034" id="9  034" >34</span>
 Let him remove   his   rod from me, and let not his fear terrify me:  <span class="verse" rel="v0189  035" id="9  035" >35</span>

 And I will say to the Lord, Do not teach me to be impious; and therefore have you thus judged me?  <span class="verse" rel="v01810  003" id="10  003" >3</span>
 Is it good before you if I be unrighteous? for you have disowned the work of your hands, and attended to the counsel of the ungodly.  <span class="verse" rel="v01810  004" id="10  004" >4</span>
 Or do you see as a mortal sees? or will you look as a man sees?  <span class="verse" rel="v01810  005" id="10  005" >5</span>
 Or is your life human, or your years   the years   of a man,  <span class="verse" rel="v01810  006" id="10  006" >6</span>
 that you have enquired into my iniquity, and searched out my sins?  <span class="verse" rel="v01810  007" id="10  007" >7</span>
 For you know that I have not committed iniquity: but who is he that can deliver out of your hands?  <span class="verse" rel="v01810  008" id="10  008" >8</span>
 Your hands have formed me and made me; afterwards you did change   your mind  , and strike me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01810  009" id="10  009" >9</span>
 Remember that you have made me   as   clay, and you do turn me again to earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01810  010" id="10  010" >10</span>
 Hast you not poured me out like milk, and curdled me like cheese?  <span class="verse" rel="v01810  011" id="10  011" >11</span>
 And you did clothe me with skin and flesh, and frame me with bones and sinews.  <span class="verse" rel="v01810  012" id="10  012" >12</span>
 And you did bestow upon me life and mercy, and your oversight has preserved my spirit.  <span class="verse" rel="v01810  013" id="10  013" >13</span>
 Having these things in yourself, I know that you can do all things; for nothing is impossible with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01810  014" id="10  014" >14</span>
 And if I should sin, you watch me; and you have not cleared me from iniquity.  <span class="verse" rel="v01810  015" id="10  015" >15</span>
 Or if I should be ungodly, woe is me: and if I should be righteous, I can’t lift myself up, for I am full of dishonor.  <span class="verse" rel="v01810  016" id="10  016" >16</span>

 renewing against me my torture: and you have dealt with me in great anger, and you have brought trials upon me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01810  018" id="10  018" >18</span>
 Why then did you bring me out of the womb? and why did I not die, and no eye see me,  <span class="verse" rel="v01810  019" id="10  019" >19</span>
 and I become as if I had not been? for why was I not carried from the womb to the grave?  <span class="verse" rel="v01810  020" id="10  020" >20</span>
 Is not the time of my life short? suffer me to rest a little,  <span class="verse" rel="v01810  021" id="10  021" >21</span>

 Be not a speaker of many words; for is there none to answer you?  <span class="verse" rel="v01811  004" id="11  004" >4</span>
 For say not, I am pure in my works, and blameless before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01811  005" id="11  005" >5</span>

 And if he should overthrow all things, who will say to him, What have you done?  <span class="verse" rel="v01811  011" id="11  011" >11</span>

 But man vainly buoys himself up with words; and a mortal born of woman   is   like an ass in the desert.  <span class="verse" rel="v01811  013" id="11  013" >13</span>
 For if you have made your heart pure, and lift up   your   hands towards him;  <span class="verse" rel="v01811  014" id="11  014" >14</span>
 if there is any iniquity in your hands, put if far from you, and let not unrighteousness lodge in your habitation.  <span class="verse" rel="v01811  015" id="11  015" >15</span>
 For thus shall your countenance shine again, as pure water; and you shall dive yourself of uncleanness, and shall not fear.  <span class="verse" rel="v01811  016" id="11  016" >16</span>
 And you shall forget trouble, as a wave that has passed by; and you shall not be scared.  <span class="verse" rel="v01811  017" id="11  017" >17</span>
 And your prayer   shall be   as the morning star, and life shall arise to you   as   from the noonday.  <span class="verse" rel="v01811  018" id="11  018" >18</span>

 Nevertheless I will speak to the Lord, and I will reason before him, if he will.  <span class="verse" rel="v01813  004" id="13  004" >4</span>
 But you° are all bad physicians, and healers of diseases.  <span class="verse" rel="v01813  005" id="13  005" >5</span>

 But I will tell you, listen to me; I will tell you now what I have seen;  <span class="verse" rel="v01815  018" id="15  018" >18</span>
 things wise men say, and their fathers have not hidden.  <span class="verse" rel="v01815  019" id="15  019" >19</span>
 To them alone the earth was given, and no stranger came upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01815  020" id="15  020" >20</span>
 All the life of the ungodly   is spent   in care, and the years granted to the oppressor are numbered.  <span class="verse" rel="v01815  021" id="15  021" >21</span>
 And his terror is in his ears: just when he seems to be at peace, his overthrow will come.  <span class="verse" rel="v01815  022" id="15  022" >22</span>
 Let him not trust that he shall return from darkness, for he has been already made over to the power of the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v01815  023" id="15  023" >23</span>
 And he has been appointed to be food for vultures; and he knows within himself that he is doomed to be a carcass: and a dark day shall carry him away as with a whirlwind.  <span class="verse" rel="v01815  024" id="15  024" >24</span>
 Distress also and anguish shall come upon him: he shall fall as a captain in the first rank.  <span class="verse" rel="v01815  025" id="15  025" >25</span>
 For he has lifted his hands against the Lord, and he has hardened his neck against the Almighty Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01815  026" id="15  026" >26</span>
 And he has run against him with insolence, on the thickness of the back of his shield.  <span class="verse" rel="v01815  027" id="15  027" >27</span>
 For he has covered his face with his fat, and made layers of fat upon his thighs.  <span class="verse" rel="v01815  028" id="15  028" >28</span>
 And let him lodge in desolate cities, and enter into houses without inhabitant: and what they have prepared, others shall carry away.  <span class="verse" rel="v01815  029" id="15  029" >29</span>
 Neither shall he at all grow rich, nor shall his substance remain: he shall not cast a shadow upon the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01815  030" id="15  030" >30</span>
 Neither shall he in any wise escape the darkness: let the wind blast his blossom, and let his flower fall off.  <span class="verse" rel="v01815  031" id="15  031" >31</span>
 Let him not think that he shall endure; for his end shall be vanity.  <span class="verse" rel="v01815  032" id="15  032" >32</span>
 His harvest shall perish before the time, and his branch shall not flourish.  <span class="verse" rel="v01815  033" id="15  033" >33</span>
 And let him be gathered as the unripe grape before the time, and let him fall as the blossom of the olive.  <span class="verse" rel="v01815  034" id="15  034" >34</span>
 For death is the witness of an ungodly man, and fire shall burn the houses of them that receive gifts.  <span class="verse" rel="v01815  035" id="15  035" >35</span>
 And he shall conceive sorrows, and his end shall be vanity, and his belly shall bear deceit.

<p><span class="chapter" id="16  001">16  </span> But Job answered and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  002" id="16  002" >2</span>
 I have heard many such things: poor comforters are you° all.  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  003" id="16  003" >3</span>
 What! is there any reason in vain words? or what will hinder you from answering?  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  004" id="16  004" >4</span>
 I also will speak as you°   do  : if indeed your soul were in my   soul's   stead,  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  005" id="16  005" >5</span>
 then would I insult you with words, and I would shake my head at you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  006" id="16  006" >6</span>
 And would there were strength in my mouth, and I would not spare the movement of my lips.  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  007" id="16  007" >7</span>
 For if I should speak, I shall not feel the pain of my wound: and if I should be silent, how shall I be wounded the less?  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  008" id="16  008" >8</span>
 But now he has made me weary, and a worn-out fool; and you have laid hold of me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  009" id="16  009" >9</span>
 My falsehood has become a testimony, and has risen up against me: it has confronted me to my face.  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  010" id="16  010" >10</span>
 In his anger he has cast me down; he has gnashed his teeth upon me: the weapons of his robbers have fallen upon me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  011" id="16  011" >11</span>
 He has attacked me with the keen glances of his eyes; with his sharp   spear   he has struck me   down   upon my knees; and they have run upon me with one accord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  012" id="16  012" >12</span>
 For the Lord has delivered me into the hands of unrighteous men, and thrown me upon the ungodly.  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  013" id="16  013" >13</span>
 When I was at peace he distracted me: he took me by the hair of the head, and plucked it out: he set me up as a mark.  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  014" id="16  014" >14</span>
 They surrounded me with spears, aiming at my reins: without sparing   me   they poured out my gall upon the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  015" id="16  015" >15</span>
 They overthrew me with fall upon fall: they ran upon me in   their   might.  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  016" id="16  016" >16</span>
 They sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and my strength has been spent on the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  017" id="16  017" >17</span>
 My belly has been parched with wailing, and darkness is on my eyelids.  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  018" id="16  018" >18</span>
 Yet there was no injustice in my hands, and my prayer is pure.  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  019" id="16  019" >19</span>
 Earth, cover not over the blood of my flesh, and let my cry have no place.  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  020" id="16  020" >20</span>
 And now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my advocate is on high.  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  021" id="16  021" >21</span>
 Let my supplication come to the Lord, and let my eye weep before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  022" id="16  022" >22</span>
 Oh that a man might plead before the Lord, even   as   the son of man with his neighbor!  <span class="verse" rel="v01816  023" id="16  023" >23</span>
 But my years are numbered and   their end   come, and I shall go by the way by which I shall not return.

 Weary I entreat; and what have I done? and strangers have stolen my goods.  <span class="verse" rel="v01817  003" id="17  003" >3</span>
 Who is this? let him join hands with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01817  004" id="17  004" >4</span>
 For you have hid their heart from wisdom; therefore you shall not exalt them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01817  005" id="17  005" >5</span>

 But you have made me a byword amount the nations, and I am become a scorn to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01817  007" id="17  007" >7</span>
 For my eyes are dimmed through pain; I have been grievously beset by all.  <span class="verse" rel="v01817  008" id="17  008" >8</span>
 Wonder has seized true men upon this; and let the just rise up against the transgressor.  <span class="verse" rel="v01817  009" id="17  009" >9</span>
 But let the faithful hold on his own way, and let him that is pure of hands take courage.  <span class="verse" rel="v01817  010" id="17  010" >10</span>
 Howbeit, do you° all strengthen   yourselves   and come now, for I do not find truth in you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01817  011" id="17  011" >11</span>
 My days have passed in groaning, and my heart-strings are broken.  <span class="verse" rel="v01817  012" id="17  012" >12</span>
 I have turned the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.  <span class="verse" rel="v01817  013" id="17  013" >13</span>
 For if I remain, Hades is my habitation: and my bed has been made in darkness.  <span class="verse" rel="v01817  014" id="17  014" >14</span>
 I have called upon death to be my father, and corruption   to be   my mother and sister.  <span class="verse" rel="v01817  015" id="17  015" >15</span>
 Where then is yet my hope? or   where   shall I see my good?  <span class="verse" rel="v01817  016" id="17  016" >16</span>

 How long will you continue? forbear, that we also may speak.  <span class="verse" rel="v01818  003" id="18  003" >3</span>

 But the light of the ungodly shall be quenched, and their flame shall not go up.  <span class="verse" rel="v01818  006" id="18  006" >6</span>

 Let the meanest of men spoil his goods, and let his counsel deceive   him  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01818  008" id="18  008" >8</span>
 His foot also has been caught in a snare,   and   let it be entangled in a net.  <span class="verse" rel="v01818  009" id="18  009" >9</span>
 And let snares come upon him: he shall strengthen those that thirst for his destruction.  <span class="verse" rel="v01818  010" id="18  010" >10</span>
 His snare is hid in the earth, and that which shall take him is by the path.  <span class="verse" rel="v01818  011" id="18  011" >11</span>
 Let pains destroy him round about, and let many   enemies   come about him,  <span class="verse" rel="v01818  012" id="18  012" >12</span>
    vex him   with distressing hunger: and a signal destruction has been prepared for him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01818  013" id="18  013" >13</span>
 Let the soles of his feet be devoured: and death shall consume his beauty.  <span class="verse" rel="v01818  014" id="18  014" >14</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="19  001">19  </span> Then Job answered and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  002" id="19  002" >2</span>
 How long will you° vex my soul, and destroy me with words? only know that the Lord has dealt with me thus.  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  003" id="19  003" >3</span>
 You° speak against me; you° do not feel for me, but bear hard upon me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  004" id="19  004" >4</span>
 Yes verily, I have erred in truth, (but the error abides with myself) in having spoken words which it was not right   to speak  ; and my words err, and are unreasonable.  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  005" id="19  005" >5</span>
 But alas! for you° magnify yourselves against me, and insult me with reproach.  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  006" id="19  006" >6</span>
 Know then that it is the Lord that has troubled   me  , and has raised his bulwark against me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  007" id="19  007" >7</span>
 Behold, I laugh at reproach; I will not speak:   or   I will cry out, but   there is   nowhere judgment.  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  008" id="19  008" >8</span>
 I am fenced round about, and can by no means escape: he has set darkness before my face.  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  009" id="19  009" >9</span>
 And he has stripped me of my glory, and has taken the crown from my head.  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  010" id="19  010" >10</span>
 He has torn me around about, and I am gone: and he has cut off my hope like a tree.  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  011" id="19  011" >11</span>
 And he has dreadfully handled me in anger, and has counted me for an enemy.  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  012" id="19  012" >12</span>
 His troops also came upon me with one accord, liars in wait compassed my ways.  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  013" id="19  013" >13</span>
 My brethren have stood aloof from me; they have recognized strangers   rather   than me: and my friends have become pitiless.  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  014" id="19  014" >14</span>
 My nearest of kin have not acknowledged me, and they that knew my name, have forgotten me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  015" id="19  015" >15</span>
    As for   my household, and my maidservants, I was a stranger before them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  016" id="19  016" >16</span>
 I called my servant, and he listened not; and my mouth entreated   him  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  017" id="19  017" >17</span>
 And I implored my wife, and earnestly entreated the sons of my concubines.  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  018" id="19  018" >18</span>
 But they rejected me for ever; whenever I rise up, they speak against me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  019" id="19  019" >19</span>
 They that saw me abhorred me: the very persons whom I had loved, rose up against me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  020" id="19  020" >20</span>
 My flesh is corrupt under my skin, and my bones are held in   my   teeth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  021" id="19  021" >21</span>
 Pity me, pity me, O friends; for it is the hand of the Lord that has touched me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  022" id="19  022" >22</span>
 Therefore do you° persecute me as also the Lord   does  , and are not satisfied with my flesh?  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  023" id="19  023" >23</span>
 For oh that my words were written, and that they were recorded in a book forever,  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  024" id="19  024" >24</span>
 with an iron pen and lead, or graven in the rocks!  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  025" id="19  025" >25</span>
 For I know that he is eternal who is about to deliver me,  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  026" id="19  026" >26</span>
    and   to raise up upon the earth my skin that endures these   sufferings  : for these things have been accomplished to me of the Lord;  <span class="verse" rel="v01819  027" id="19  027" >27</span>

 Like a dream that has fled away, he shall not be found; and he has fled like a vision of the night.  <span class="verse" rel="v01820  009" id="20  009" >9</span>

 Let   his   inferiors destroy his children, and let his hands kindle the fire of sorrow.  <span class="verse" rel="v01820  011" id="20  011" >11</span>

 Though evil be sweet in his mouth,   though   he will hide it under his tongue;  <span class="verse" rel="v01820  013" id="20  013" >13</span>
 though he will not spare it, and will not leave it, but will keep it in the midst of his throat:  <span class="verse" rel="v01820  014" id="20  014" >14</span>
 yet he shall not at all be able to help himself; the gall of an asp is in his belly.  <span class="verse" rel="v01820  015" id="20  015" >15</span>
    His   wealth unjustly collected shall be vomited up; a messenger   of wrath   shall drag him out of his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01820  016" id="20  016" >16</span>
 And let him suck the poison of serpents, and let the serpent's tongue kill him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01820  017" id="20  017" >17</span>
 Let him not see the milk of the pastures, nor the supplies of honey and butter.  <span class="verse" rel="v01820  018" id="20  018" >18</span>
 He has laboured unprofitably and in vain,   for   wealth of which he shall not taste:   it is   as a lean thing, unfit for food, which he can’t swallow.  <span class="verse" rel="v01820  019" id="20  019" >19</span>

 There is no security to his possessions; he shall not be saved by his desire.  <span class="verse" rel="v01820  021" id="20  021" >21</span>

 If by any means he would fill his belly, let   God   send upon him the fury of wrath; let him bring a torrent of pains upon him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01820  024" id="20  024" >24</span>
 And he shall by no means escape from the power of the sword; let the brazen bow wound him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01820  025" id="20  025" >25</span>
 And let the arrow pierce through his body; and let the stars be against his dwelling-place: let terrors come upon him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01820  026" id="20  026" >26</span>
 And let all darkness wait for him: a fire that burns not out shall consume him; and let a stranger plague his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01820  027" id="20  027" >27</span>
 And let the heaven reveal his iniquities, and the earth rise up against him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01820  028" id="20  028" >28</span>
 Let destruction bring his house to an end; let a day of wrath come upon him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01820  029" id="20  029" >29</span>
 This is the portion of an ungodly man from the Lord, and the possession of his goods   appointed him   by the all-seeing   God  .

 Hear you°, hear you° my words, that I may not have this consolation from you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  003" id="21  003" >3</span>
 Raise me, and I will speak; then you° shall not laugh me to scorn.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  004" id="21  004" >4</span>
 What! is my reproof of man? and why should I not be angry?  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  005" id="21  005" >5</span>
 Look upon me, and wonder, laying your hand upon your cheek.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  006" id="21  006" >6</span>
 For even when I remember, I am alarmed, and pains seize my flesh.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  007" id="21  007" >7</span>
 Therefore do the ungodly live, and grow old even in wealth?  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  008" id="21  008" >8</span>
 Their seed is according to   their   desire, and their children are in   their   sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  009" id="21  009" >9</span>
 Their houses are prosperous, neither   have they   any where   cause for   fear, neither is there a scourge from the Lord upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  010" id="21  010" >10</span>
 Their cow does not cast her calf, and their   beast   with young is safe, and does not miscarry.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  011" id="21  011" >11</span>
 And they remain as an unfailing flock, and their children play before   them  , taking up the lute and harp;  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  012" id="21  012" >12</span>
 and they rejoice at the voice of a song.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  013" id="21  013" >13</span>
 And they spend their days in wealth, and fall asleep in the rest of the grave.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  014" id="21  014" >14</span>
 Yet   such a man   says to the Lord, Depart from me; I desire not to know your ways.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  015" id="21  015" >15</span>
 What is the Mighty One, that we should serve him? and what profit is there that we should approach him?  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  016" id="21  016" >16</span>
 For their good things were in   their   hands, but he regards not the works of the ungodly.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  017" id="21  017" >17</span>
 Nevertheless, the lamp of the ungodly also shall be put out, and destruction shall come upon them, and pangs of vengeance shall seize them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  018" id="21  018" >18</span>
 And they shall be as chaff before the wind, or as dust which the storm has taken up.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  019" id="21  019" >19</span>
 Let his substance fail   to supply   his children:   God   shall recompense him, and he shall know it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  020" id="21  020" >20</span>
 Let his eyes see his own destruction, and let him not be saved by the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  021" id="21  021" >21</span>
 For his desire is in his house with him, and the number of his months has been suddenly cut off.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  022" id="21  022" >22</span>
 Is it not the Lord who teaches understanding and knowledge? and does not he judge murders?  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  023" id="21  023" >23</span>
 One shall die in his perfect strength, and wholly at ease and prosperous;  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  024" id="21  024" >24</span>
 and his inwards are full of fat, and his marrow is diffused   throughout him  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  025" id="21  025" >25</span>
 And another dies in bitterness of soul, not eating any good thing.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  026" id="21  026" >26</span>
 But they lie down in the earth together, and corruption covers them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  027" id="21  027" >27</span>
 So I know you, that you° presumptuously attack me:  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  028" id="21  028" >28</span>
 so that you° will say, Where is the house of the prince? and where is the covering of the tabernacles of the ungodly?  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  029" id="21  029" >29</span>
 Ask those that go by the way, and do not disown their tokens.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  030" id="21  030" >30</span>
 For the wicked hastens to the day of destruction: they shall be led away for the day of his vengeance.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  031" id="21  031" >31</span>
 Who will tell him his way to his face, whereas he has done   it  ? who shall recompense him?  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  032" id="21  032" >32</span>
 And he has been led away to the tombs, and he has watched over the heaps.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  033" id="21  033" >33</span>
 The stones of the valley have been sweet to him, and every man shall depart after him, and   there are   innumerable   ones   before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01821  034" id="21  034" >34</span>
 How then do you° comfort me in vain? whereas I have no rest from your molestation.

 Is it not the Lord that teaches understanding and knowledge?  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  003" id="22  003" >3</span>
 For what matters it to the Lord, if you were blameless in   your   works? or is it profitable that you should perfect your way?  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  004" id="22  004" >4</span>
 Will you maintain and plead your own cause? and will he enter into judgment with you?  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  005" id="22  005" >5</span>
 Is not your wickedness abundant, and your sins innumerable?  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  006" id="22  006" >6</span>
 And you have taken security of your brethren for nothing, and have taken away the clothing of the naked.  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  007" id="22  007" >7</span>
 Neither have you given water to the thirsty to drink, but have taken away the morsel of the hungry.  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  008" id="22  008" >8</span>
 And you have accepted the persons of some; and you have established those   that were already settled   on the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  009" id="22  009" >9</span>
 But you have sent widows away empty, and has afflicted orphans.  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  010" id="22  010" >10</span>
 Therefore snares have compassed you, and disastrous war has troubled you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  011" id="22  011" >11</span>
 The light has proved darkness to you, and water has covered you on your lying down.  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  012" id="22  012" >12</span>
 Does not he that dwells in the high places observe? and has he not brought down the proud?  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  013" id="22  013" >13</span>
 And you have said, What does the Mighty One know? does he judge in the dark?  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  014" id="22  014" >14</span>
 A cloud is his hiding-place, and he shall not be seen; and he passes through the circle of heaven.  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  015" id="22  015" >15</span>
 Will you   not   mark the old way, which righteous men have trodden?  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  016" id="22  016" >16</span>
 who were seized before their time: their foundations   are as   an overflowing stream.  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  017" id="22  017" >17</span>
 Who say, What will the Lord do to us? or what will the Almighty bring upon us?  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  018" id="22  018" >18</span>
 Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel for the wicked is far from him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  019" id="22  019" >19</span>
 The righteous have seen   it  , and laughed, and the blameless one has derided   them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  020" id="22  020" >20</span>
 Verily their substance has been utterly destroyed, and the fire shall devour what is left of their   property  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  021" id="22  021" >21</span>
 Be firm, I pray you, if you can endure; then your fruit shall prosper.  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  022" id="22  022" >22</span>
 And receive a declaration from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  023" id="22  023" >23</span>
 And if you shall turn and humble yourself before the Lord, you have   thus   removed unrighteousness far from your habitation.  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  024" id="22  024" >24</span>
 You shall lay up for yourself   treasure   in a heap on the rock; and Sophir   shall be   as the rock of the torrent.  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  025" id="22  025" >25</span>
 So the Almighty shall be your helper from enemies, and he shall bring you forth pure as silver that has been tried by fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  026" id="22  026" >26</span>
 Then shall you have boldness before the Lord, looking up cheerfully to heaven.  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  027" id="22  027" >27</span>
 And he shall hear you when you pray to him, and he shall grant you   power   to pay your vows.  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  028" id="22  028" >28</span>
 And he shall establish to you again a habitation of righteousness and there shall be light upon your paths.  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  029" id="22  029" >29</span>
 Because you have humbled yourself; and you shall say,   Man   has behaved proudly, but he shall save him that is of lowly eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v01822  030" id="22  030" >30</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="23  001">23  </span> Then Job answered and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v01823  002" id="23  002" >2</span>
 Yes, I know that pleading is out of my reach; and his hand has been made heavy upon my groaning.  <span class="verse" rel="v01823  003" id="23  003" >3</span>
 Who would then know that I might find him, and come to an end   of the matter  ?  <span class="verse" rel="v01823  004" id="23  004" >4</span>
 And I would plead my own cause, and he would fill my mouth with arguments.  <span class="verse" rel="v01823  005" id="23  005" >5</span>
 And I would know the remedies which he would speak to me, and I would perceive what he would tell me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01823  006" id="23  006" >6</span>
 Though he should come on me in   his   great strength, then he would not threaten me;  <span class="verse" rel="v01823  007" id="23  007" >7</span>
 for truth and reproof are from him; and he would bring forth my judgment to an end.  <span class="verse" rel="v01823  008" id="23  008" >8</span>
 For if I shall go first, and exist no longer, still what do I know   concerning   the latter end?  <span class="verse" rel="v01823  009" id="23  009" >9</span>
 When he wrought on the left hand, then I observed   it   not: his right hand shall encompass me but I shall not see   it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01823  010" id="23  010" >10</span>
 For he knows already my way; and he has tried me as gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v01823  011" id="23  011" >11</span>
 And I will go forth according to his commandments, for I have kept his ways; and I shall not turn aside from his commandments,  <span class="verse" rel="v01823  012" id="23  012" >12</span>
 neither shall I transgress; but I have hid his words in my bosom.  <span class="verse" rel="v01823  13-14" id="23  13-14" >13-14</span>
 And if too he has thus judged, who is he that has contradicted, for he has both willed   a thing   and done it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01823  015" id="23  015" >15</span>
 Therefore am I troubled at him; and when I was reproved, I thought of him. Therefore let me take good heed before him: I will consider, and be afraid of him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01823  016" id="23  016" >16</span>
 But the Lord has softened my heart, and the Almighty has troubled me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01823  017" id="23  017" >17</span>
 For I knew not that darkness would come upon me, and thick darkness has covered   me   before my face.

 while the ungodly have passed over the bound, carrying off the flock with the shepherd?  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  003" id="24  003" >3</span>
 They have led away, the ass of the fatherless, and taken the widow's ox for a pledge.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  004" id="24  004" >4</span>
 They have turned aside the weak from the right way: and the meek of the earth have hidden themselves together.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  005" id="24  005" >5</span>
 And they have departed like asses in the field, having gone forth on my account according to their own order: his bread is sweet to   his   little ones.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  006" id="24  006" >6</span>
 They have reaped a field that was not their own before the time: the poor have laboured in the vineyards of the ungodly without pay and without food.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  007" id="24  007" >7</span>
 They have caused many naked to sleep without clothes, and they have taken away the covering of their body.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  008" id="24  008" >8</span>
 They are wet with the drops of the mountains: they have embraced the rock, because they had no shelter.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  009" id="24  009" >9</span>
 They have snatched the fatherless from the breast, and have afflicted the outcast.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  010" id="24  010" >10</span>
 And they have wrongfully caused   others   to sleep without clothing, and taken away the morsel of the hungry.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  011" id="24  011" >11</span>
 They have unrighteously laid wait in narrow places, and have not known the righteous way.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  012" id="24  012" >12</span>
 Who have cast forth   the   poor from the city and their own houses, and the soul of the children has groaned aloud.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  013" id="24  013" >13</span>
 Why then has he not visited these? forasmuch as they were upon the earth, and took no notice, and they knew not the way of righteousness, neither have they walked in their   appointed   paths?  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  014" id="24  014" >14</span>
 But having known their works, he delivered them into darkness: and in the night one will be as a thief:  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  015" id="24  015" >15</span>
 and the eye of the adulterer has watched   for   the darkness, saying, Eye shall not perceive me, and he puts a covering on his face.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  016" id="24  016" >16</span>
 In darkness he digs through houses: by day they conceal themselves securely: they know not the light.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  017" id="24  017" >17</span>
 For the morning is to them all   as   the shadow of death, for   each   will be conscious of the terror of the shadow of death.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  018" id="24  018" >18</span>
 He is swift on the face of the water: let his portion be cursed on the earth; and let their plants be laid bare.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  019" id="24  019" >19</span>
    Let them be   withered upon the earth; for they have plundered the sheaves of the fatherless.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  020" id="24  020" >20</span>
 Then is his sin brought to remembrance, and he vanishes like a vapor of dew: but let what he has done be recompensed to him, and let every unrighteous one be crushed like rotten wood.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  021" id="24  021" >21</span>
 For he has not treated the barren woman well, and has had no pity on a feeble woman.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  022" id="24  022" >22</span>
 And in wrath he has overthrown the helpless: therefore when he has arisen,   a man   will not feel secure of his own life.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  023" id="24  023" >23</span>
 When he has fallen sick, let him not hope to recover: but let him perish by disease.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  024" id="24  024" >24</span>
 For his exaltation has hurt many; but he has withered as mallows in the heat, or as an ear of corn falling off of itself from the stalk.  <span class="verse" rel="v01824  025" id="24  025" >25</span>
 But if not, who is he that says I speak falsely, and will make my words of no account?

 He keeps back the face of his throne, stretching out his cloud upon it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01826  010" id="26  010" >10</span>

 Far be it from me that I should justify you till I die; for I will not let go my innocence,  <span class="verse" rel="v01827  006" id="27  006" >6</span>
 but keeping fast to   my   righteousness I will by no means let it go: for I am not conscious to myself of having done any thing amiss.  <span class="verse" rel="v01827  007" id="27  007" >7</span>
 Nay rather, but let my enemies be as the overthrow of the ungodly, and they that rise up against me, as the destruction of transgressors.  <span class="verse" rel="v01827  008" id="27  008" >8</span>
 For what is the hope of the ungodly, that he holds to it? will he indeed trust in the Lord   and   be saved?  <span class="verse" rel="v01827  009" id="27  009" >9</span>
 Will God hear his prayer? or, when distress has come upon him,  <span class="verse" rel="v01827  010" id="27  010" >10</span>
 has he any confidence before him? or will   God   hear him as he calls upon him?  <span class="verse" rel="v01827  011" id="27  011" >11</span>
 Yet now I will tell you what is in the hand of the Lord: I will not lie concerning the things which are with the Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v01827  012" id="27  012" >12</span>
 Behold, you° all know that you° are adding vanity to vanity.  <span class="verse" rel="v01827  013" id="27  013" >13</span>
 This is the portion of an ungodly man from the Lord, and the possession of oppressors shall come upon them from the Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v01827  014" id="27  014" >14</span>
 And if their children be many, they shall be for slaughter: and if they grow up, they shall beg.  <span class="verse" rel="v01827  015" id="27  015" >15</span>
 And they that survive of him shall utterly perish, and no one shall pity their widows.  <span class="verse" rel="v01827  016" id="27  016" >16</span>
 Even if he should gather silver as earth, and prepare gold as clay;  <span class="verse" rel="v01827  017" id="27  017" >17</span>
 All these things shall the righteous gain, and the true-hearted shall possess his wealth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01827  018" id="27  018" >18</span>
 And his house is gone like moths, and like a spider's web.  <span class="verse" rel="v01827  019" id="27  019" >19</span>
 The rich man shall lie down, and shall not continue: he has opened his eyes, and he is not.  <span class="verse" rel="v01827  020" id="27  020" >20</span>
 Pains have come upon him as water, and darkness has carried him away by night.  <span class="verse" rel="v01827  021" id="27  021" >21</span>
 And a burning wind shall catch him, and he shall depart, and it shall utterly drive him out of his place.  <span class="verse" rel="v01827  022" id="27  022" >22</span>
 And   God   shall cast   trouble   upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v01827  023" id="27  023" >23</span>
 He shall cause   men   to clap their hands against them, and shall hiss him out of his place.

<p><span class="chapter" id="28  001">28  </span> For there is a place for the silver, whence it comes, and a place for the gold, whence it is refined.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  002" id="28  002" >2</span>
 For iron comes out of the earth, and brass is hewn out like stone.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  003" id="28  003" >3</span>
 He has set a bound to darkness, and he searches out every limit: a stone   is   darkness, and the shadow of death.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  004" id="28  004" >4</span>
 There is a cutting off the torrent by reason of dust: so they that forget the right way are weakened; they are removed from   among   men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  005" id="28  005" >5</span>
    As for   the earth, out of it shall come bread: under it has been turned up as it were fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  006" id="28  006" >6</span>
 Her stones are the place of the sapphire: and   her   dust   supplies   man with gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  007" id="28  007" >7</span>
    There is   a path, the fowl has not known it, neither has the eye of the vulture seen it:  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  008" id="28  008" >8</span>
 neither have the sons of the proud trodden it, a lion has not passed upon it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  009" id="28  009" >9</span>
 He has stretched forth his hand on the sharp   rock  , and turned up mountains by the roots:  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  010" id="28  010" >10</span>
 and he has interrupted the whirlpools of rivers, and my eye has seen every precious thing.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  011" id="28  011" >11</span>
 And he has laid bare the depths of rivers, and has brought his power to light.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  012" id="28  012" >12</span>
 But whence has wisdom been discovered? and what is the place of knowledge?  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  013" id="28  013" >13</span>
 A mortal has not known its way, neither indeed has it been discovered among men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  014" id="28  014" >14</span>
 The depth said, It is not in me: and the sea said, It is not with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  015" id="28  015" >15</span>
 One shall not give fine gold instead of it, neither shall silver be weighed in exchange for it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  016" id="28  016" >16</span>
 Neither shall it be compared with gold of Sophir, with the precious onyx and sapphire.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  017" id="28  017" >17</span>
 Gold and crystal shall not be equalled to it, neither shall vessels of gold be its exchange.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  018" id="28  018" >18</span>
 Coral and fine pearl shall not be mentioned: but do you esteem wisdom above the most precious things.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  019" id="28  019" >19</span>
 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not be equalled to it; it shall not be compared with pure gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  020" id="28  020" >20</span>
 Whence then is wisdom found? and of what kind is the place of understanding?  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  021" id="28  021" >21</span>
 It has escaped the notice of every man, and has been hidden from the birds of the sky.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  022" id="28  022" >22</span>
 Destruction and Death said, We have heard the report of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  023" id="28  023" >23</span>
 God has well ordered the way of it, and he knows the place of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  024" id="28  024" >24</span>
 For he surveys the whole   earth   under heaven, knowing the things in the earth:  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  025" id="28  025" >25</span>
 all that he has made; the weight of the winds, the measures of the water.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  026" id="28  026" >26</span>
 When he made   them  , thus he saw and numbered them, and made a way for the pealing of the thunder.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  027" id="28  027" >27</span>
 Then he saw it, and declared it: he prepared it   and   traced it out.  <span class="verse" rel="v01828  028" id="28  028" >28</span>
 And he said to man, Behold, godliness is wisdom: and to abstain from evil is understanding.

<p><span class="chapter" id="29  001">29  </span> And Job continued and said in his parable,  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  002" id="29  002" >2</span>
 Oh that I were as in months past, wherein God preserved me!  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  003" id="29  003" >3</span>
 As when his lamp shone over my head; when by his light I walked through darkness.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  004" id="29  004" >4</span>
    As   when I steadfastly pursued my ways, when God took care of my house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  005" id="29  005" >5</span>
 When I was very fruitful, and my children were about me;  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  006" id="29  006" >6</span>
 when my ways were moistened with butter, and the mountains flowed for me with milk.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  007" id="29  007" >7</span>
 When I went forth early in the city, and the seat was placed for me in the streets.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  008" id="29  008" >8</span>
 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and all the old men stood up.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  009" id="29  009" >9</span>
 And the great men ceased speaking, and laid their finger on their mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  010" id="29  010" >10</span>
 And they that heard   me   blessed me, and their tongue clave to their throat.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  011" id="29  011" >11</span>
 For the ear heard, and blessed me; and the eye saw me, and turned aside.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  012" id="29  012" >12</span>
 For I saved the poor out of the hand of the oppressor, and helped the fatherless who had no helper.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  013" id="29  013" >13</span>
 Let the blessing of the perishing one come upon me; yes, the mouth of the widow has blessed me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  014" id="29  014" >14</span>
 Also I put on righteousness, and clothed myself with judgment like a mantle.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  015" id="29  015" >15</span>
 I was the eye of the blind, and the foot of the lame.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  016" id="29  016" >16</span>
 I was the father of the helpless; and I searched out the cause which I knew not.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  017" id="29  017" >17</span>
 And I broke the jaw teeth of the unrighteous; I plucked the spoil out of the midst of their teeth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  018" id="29  018" >18</span>
 And I said, My age shall continue as the stem of a palm tree; I shall live a long while.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  019" id="29  019" >19</span>
    My   root was spread out by the water, and the dew would lodge on my crop.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  020" id="29  020" >20</span>
 My glory was fresh in me, and by bow prospered in his hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  021" id="29  021" >21</span>
    Men   heard me, and gave heed, and they were silent at my counsel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  022" id="29  022" >22</span>
 At my word they spoke not again, and they were very gland whenever I spoke to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  023" id="29  023" >23</span>
 As the thirsty earth expecting the rain, so they   waited for   my speech.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  024" id="29  024" >24</span>
 Were I to laugh on them, they would not believe   it  ; and the light of my face has not failed.  <span class="verse" rel="v01829  025" id="29  025" >25</span>
 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and lived as a king in the midst of warriors, as one comforting mourners.

 Yes, why had I the strength of their hands? for them the full term   of life   was lost.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  003" id="30  003" >3</span>
    One is   childless in lack and famine,   such as   they that fled but lately the distress and misery of drought.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  004" id="30  004" >4</span>
 Who compass the salt places on the sounding   shore  , who had salt   herbs   for their food, and were dishonorable and of no repute, in lack of every good thing; who also ate roots of trees by reason of great hunger.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  005" id="30  005" >5</span>
 Thieves have risen up against me,  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  006" id="30  006" >6</span>
 whose houses were the caves of the rocks, who lived under the wild shrubs.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  007" id="30  007" >7</span>
 They will cry out among the rustling   bushes  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  008" id="30  008" >8</span>
    They are   sons of fools and vile men,   whose   name and glory   are   quenched from off the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  009" id="30  009" >9</span>
 But now I am their music, and they have me for a byword.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  010" id="30  010" >10</span>
 And they stood aloof and abhorred me, and spared not to spit in my face.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  011" id="30  011" >11</span>
 For he has opened his quiver and afflicted me: they also have cast off the restraint of my presence.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  012" id="30  012" >12</span>
 They have risen up against   me   on the right hand of   their   offspring; they have stretched out their foot, and directed against me the ways of their destruction.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  013" id="30  013" >13</span>
 My paths are ruined; for they have stripped off my raiment: he has shot at me with his weapons.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  014" id="30  014" >14</span>
 And he has pleaded against me as he will: I am overwhelmed with pains.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  015" id="30  015" >15</span>
 My pains return upon   me  ; my hope is gone like the wind, and my safety as a cloud.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  016" id="30  016" >16</span>

 And you have counted me as clay; my portion in dust and ashes.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  020" id="30  020" >20</span>
 And I have cried to you, but you hear me not: but they stood still, and observed me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  021" id="30  021" >21</span>
 They attacked me also without mercy: you have scourged me with a strong hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  022" id="30  022" >22</span>
 And you have put me to grief, and have cast me away from safety.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  023" id="30  023" >23</span>

 Yet I wept over every helpless man; I groaned when I saw a man in distress.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  026" id="30  026" >26</span>
 But I, when I waited for good things, behold, days of evils came the more upon me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  027" id="30  027" >27</span>
 My belly boiled, and would not cease: the days of poverty prevented me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  028" id="30  028" >28</span>
 I went mourning without restraint: and I have stood and cried out in the assembly.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  029" id="30  029" >29</span>
 I am become a brother of monsters, and a companion of ostriches.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  030" id="30  030" >30</span>
 And my skin has been greatly blackened, and my bones are burned with heat.  <span class="verse" rel="v01830  031" id="30  031" >31</span>

 And if too my handmaids have often said, Oh that we might be satisfied with his flesh; (whereas I was very kind:  <span class="verse" rel="v01831  032" id="31  032" >32</span>
 for the stranger did not lodge without, and my door was opened to every one that came:)  <span class="verse" rel="v01831  033" id="31  033" >33</span>
 or if too having sinned unintentionally, I hid my sin;  <span class="verse" rel="v01831  034" id="31  034" >34</span>
 (for I did not stand in awe of a great multitude, so as not to declare boldly before them:) and if too I permitted a poor man to go out of my door with an empty bosom:  <span class="verse" rel="v01831  035" id="31  035" >35</span>
 (Oh that I had a hearer,) and if I had not feared the hand of the Lord; and   as to   the written charge which I had against any one,  <span class="verse" rel="v01831  036" id="31  036" >36</span>
 I would place   it   as a chaplet on my shoulders, and read it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01831  037" id="31  037" >37</span>
 And if I did not read it and return it, having taken nothing from the debtor:  <span class="verse" rel="v01831  038" id="31  038" >38</span>
 If at any time the land groaned against me, and if its furrows mourned together;  <span class="verse" rel="v01831  039" id="31  039" >39</span>
 and if I ate its strength alone without price, and if I too grieved the heart of the owner of the soil, by taking   anything   from   him  :  <span class="verse" rel="v01831  040" id="31  040" >40</span>
 then let the nettle come up to me instead of wheat, and a bramble instead of barley. And Job ceased speaking.  
<!-- 32   040 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="32  001">32  </span> And his three friends also ceased any longer to answer Job: for Job was righteous before them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  002" id="32  002" >2</span>
 Then Elius the son of Barachiel, the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram, of the country of Ausis, was angered: and he was very angry with Job, because he justified himself before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  003" id="32  003" >3</span>
 And he was also very angry with   his   three friends, because they were not able to return answers to Job, yet set him down for an ungodly man.  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  004" id="32  004" >4</span>
 But Elius had forborne to give an answer to Job, because they were older than he.  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  005" id="32  005" >5</span>
 And Elius saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men; and he was angered in his wrath.  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  006" id="32  006" >6</span>
 And Elius the Buzite the son of Barachiel answered and said, I am younger in age, and you° are elder, therefore I kept silence, fearing to declare to you my own knowledge.  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  007" id="32  007" >7</span>
 And I said, It is not time that speaks, though in many years   men   know wisdom:  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  008" id="32  008" >8</span>
 but there is a spirit in mortals; and the inspiration of the Almighty is that which teaches.  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  009" id="32  009" >9</span>
 The long-lived are not wise   as such  ; neither do the aged know judgment.  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  010" id="32  010" >10</span>
 Therefore I said, Hear me, and I will tell you what I know.  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  011" id="32  011" >11</span>
 Listen to my words; for I will speak in your hearing, until you° shall have tried   the matter   with words:  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  012" id="32  012" >12</span>
 and I shall understand as far as you; and, behold, there was no one of you that answered Job his words in argument,  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  013" id="32  013" >13</span>
 lest you° should say, We have found that we have added wisdom to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  014" id="32  014" >14</span>
 And you° have commissioned a man to speak such words.  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  015" id="32  015" >15</span>
 They were afraid, they answered no longer; they gave up their speaking.  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  016" id="32  016" >16</span>
 I waited, (for I had not spoken,) because they stood still, they answered not.  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  017" id="32  017" >17</span>
 And Elius continued, and said, I will again speak,  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  018" id="32  018" >18</span>
 for I am full of words, for the spirit of my belly destroys me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  019" id="32  019" >19</span>
 And my belly is as a skin of sweet wine, bound up   and   ready to burst; or as a brazier's laboring bellows.  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  020" id="32  020" >20</span>
 I will speak, that I may open my lips and relieve myself.  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  021" id="32  021" >21</span>
 For truly I will not be awed because of man, nor indeed will I be confounded before a mortal.  <span class="verse" rel="v01832  022" id="32  022" >22</span>
 For I know not how to respect persons: and if otherwise, even the moths would eat me.  
<!-- 33   022 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="33  001">33  </span> Howbeit hear, Job, my words, and listen to my speech.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  002" id="33  002" >2</span>
 For behold, I have opened my mouth, and my tongue has spoken.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  003" id="33  003" >3</span>
 My heart   shall be found   pure by   my   words; and the understanding of my lips shall meditate purity.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  004" id="33  004" >4</span>
 The Divine Spirit is that which formed me, and the breath of the Almighty that which teaches me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  005" id="33  005" >5</span>
 If you can, give me an answer: wait therefore; stand against me, and I   will stand   against you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  006" id="33  006" >6</span>
 You are formed out of the clay as also I: we have been formed out of the same   substance  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  007" id="33  007" >7</span>
 My fear shall not terrify you, neither shall my hand be heavy upon you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  008" id="33  008" >8</span>
 But you have said in my ears, (I have heard the voice of your words;) because you say, I am pure, not having sinned;  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  009" id="33  009" >9</span>
 I am blameless, for I have not transgressed.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  010" id="33  010" >10</span>
 Yet he has discovered a charge against me, and he has reckoned me as an adversary.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  011" id="33  011" >11</span>
 And he has put my foot in the stocks, and has watched all my ways.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  012" id="33  012" >12</span>
 For how say you, I am righteous, yet he has not listened to me? for he that is above mortals is eternal.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  013" id="33  013" >13</span>
 But you say, Why has he not heard every word of my cause?  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  014" id="33  014" >14</span>
 For when the Lord speaks once, or a second time,  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  015" id="33  015" >15</span>
    sending   a dream, or in the meditation of the night; (as when a dreadful alarm happens to fall upon men, in slumberings on the bed:)  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  016" id="33  016" >16</span>
 then opens he the understanding of men: he scares them with such fearful visions:  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  017" id="33  017" >17</span>
 to turn a man from unrighteousness, and he delivers his body from a fall.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  018" id="33  018" >18</span>
 He spares also his soul from death, and   suffers   him not to fall in war.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  019" id="33  019" >19</span>
 And again, he chastens him with sickness on his bed, and the multitude of his bones is benumbed.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  020" id="33  020" >20</span>
 And he shall not be able to take any food, though his soul shall desire meat;  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  021" id="33  021" >21</span>
 until his flesh shall be consumed, and he shall show his bones bare.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  022" id="33  022" >22</span>
 His soul also draws near to death, and his life is in Hades.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  023" id="33  023" >23</span>
 Though there should be a thousand messengers of death, not one of them shall wound him: if he should purpose in his heart to turn to the Lord, and declare to man his fault, and show his folly;  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  024" id="33  024" >24</span>
 he will support him, that he should not perish, and will restore his body as   fresh   plaster upon a wall; and he will fill his bones with morrow.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  025" id="33  025" >25</span>
 And he will make his flesh tender as that of a babe, and he will restore him among men in   his   full strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  026" id="33  026" >26</span>
 And he shall pray to the Lord, and his prayer shall be accepted of him; he shall enter with a cheerful countenance, with a full expression   of praise  : for he will render to men   their   due.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  027" id="33  027" >27</span>
 Even then a man shall blame himself, saying, What kind of things have I done? and he has not punished me according to the full amount of my sins.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  028" id="33  028" >28</span>
 Deliver my soul, that it may not go to destruction, and my life shall see the light.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  029" id="33  029" >29</span>
 Behold, all these things, the Mighty One works in a threefold manner with a man.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  030" id="33  030" >30</span>
 And he has delivered my soul from death, that my life may praise him in the light.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  031" id="33  031" >31</span>
 Listen, Job, and hear me: be silent, and I will speak.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  032" id="33  032" >32</span>
 If you have words, answer me: speak, for I desire you to be justified.  <span class="verse" rel="v01833  033" id="33  033" >33</span>
 If not, do you hear me: be silent, and I will teach you.  
<!-- 34   033 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="34  001">34  </span> And Elius continued, and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  002" id="34  002" >2</span>
 Hear me, you° wise men; listen, you° that have knowledge.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  003" id="34  003" >3</span>
 For the ear tries words, and the mouth tastes meat.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  004" id="34  004" >4</span>
 Let us choose judgment to ourselves: let us know amount ourselves what is right.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  005" id="34  005" >5</span>
 For Job has said, I am righteous: the Lord has removed my judgment.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  006" id="34  006" >6</span>
 And he has erred in my judgment: my wound is severe without unrighteousness   of mine  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  007" id="34  007" >7</span>
 What man is as Job, drinking scorning like water?  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  008" id="34  008" >8</span>
    saying  , I have not sinned, nor committed ungodliness, nor had fellowship with workers of iniquity, to go with the ungodly.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  009" id="34  009" >9</span>
 For you should not say, There shall be no visitation of a man, whereas   there is   a visitation on him from the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  010" id="34  010" >10</span>
 Therefore hear me, you° that are wise in heart: far be it from me to sin before the Lord, and to pervert righteousness before the almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  011" id="34  011" >11</span>
 Yes, he renders to a man accordingly as each of them does, and in a man's path he will find him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  012" id="34  012" >12</span>
 And think you that the Lord will do wrong, or will the Almighty who made the earth wrest judgment?  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  013" id="34  013" >13</span>
 And who is he that made   the whole world   under heaven, and all things therein?  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  014" id="34  014" >14</span>
 For if he would confine, and restrain his spirit with himself;  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  015" id="34  015" >15</span>
 all flesh would die together, and every mortal would return to the earth, whence also he was formed.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  016" id="34  016" >16</span>
 Take heed lest he rebuke   you  : hear this, listen to the voice of words.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  017" id="34  017" >17</span>
 Behold then the one that hates iniquities, and that destroys the wicked, who is for ever just.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  018" id="34  018" >18</span>
    He is   ungodly that says to a king, You are a transgressor,   that says   to princes, O most ungodly one.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  019" id="34  019" >19</span>
    Such a one   as would not reverence the face of an honorable man, neither knows how to give honor to the great, so as that their persons should be respected.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  020" id="34  020" >20</span>
 But it shall turn out vanity to them, to cry and beseech a man; for they dealt unlawfully, the poor being turned aside   from their right  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  021" id="34  021" >21</span>
 For he surveys the works of men, and nothing of what they do has escaped him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  022" id="34  022" >22</span>
 Neither shall there be a place for the workers of iniquity to hide themselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  023" id="34  023" >23</span>
 For he will not lay upon a man more   than right  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  024" id="34  024" >24</span>
 For the Lord looks down upon all men, who comprehends unsearchable things, glorious also and excellent things without number.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  025" id="34  025" >25</span>
 Who discovers their works, and will bring night about   upon them  , and they shall be brought low.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  026" id="34  026" >26</span>
 And he quite destroys the ungodly, for they are seen before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  027" id="34  027" >27</span>
 Because they turned aside from the law of God, and did not regard his ordinances,  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  028" id="34  028" >28</span>
 so as to bring before him the cry of the needy; for he will hear the cry of the poor.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  029" id="34  029" >29</span>
 And he will give quiet, and who will condemn? and he will hide his face, and who shall see him? whether   it be done   against a nation, or against a man also:  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  030" id="34  030" >30</span>
 causing a hypocrite to be king, because of the waywardness of the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  031" id="34  031" >31</span>
 For   there is   one that says to the Mighty One, I have received   blessings  ; I will not take a pledge:  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  032" id="34  032" >32</span>
 I will see apart from myself: do you show me if I have done unrighteousness; I will not do   so   any more.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  033" id="34  033" >33</span>
 Will he take vengeance for it on you, whereas you will put   it   far   from you  ? for you shall choose, and not I; and what you know, speak you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  034" id="34  034" >34</span>
 Because the wise in heart shall say this, and a wise man listens to my word.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  035" id="34  035" >35</span>
 But Job has not spoken with understanding, his words are not   uttered   with knowledge.  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  036" id="34  036" >36</span>
 Howbeit do you learn, Job: no longer make answer as the foolish:  <span class="verse" rel="v01834  037" id="34  037" >37</span>
 that we add not to our sins: for iniquity will be reckoned against us, if   we   speak many words before the Lord.  
<!-- 35   037 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="35  001">35  </span> And Elius resumed and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v01835  002" id="35  002" >2</span>
 What is this that you think to be according to right? who are you that you have said, I am righteous before the Lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v01835  003" id="35  003" >3</span>
 I will answer you, and your three friends.  <span class="verse" rel="v01835  004" id="35  004" >4</span>
 Look up to the sky and see; and consider the clouds, how high   they are   above you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01835  005" id="35  005" >5</span>
 If you have sinned, what will you do?  <span class="verse" rel="v01835  006" id="35  006" >6</span>
 and if too you have transgressed much, what can you perform?  <span class="verse" rel="v01835  007" id="35  007" >7</span>
 And suppose you are righteous, what will you give him? or what shall he receive of your hand?  <span class="verse" rel="v01835  008" id="35  008" >8</span>
 Your ungodliness   may affect   a man who is like to you; or your righteousness a son of man.  <span class="verse" rel="v01835  009" id="35  009" >9</span>
 They that are oppressed of a multitude will be ready to cry out; they will call for help because of the arm of many.  <span class="verse" rel="v01835  010" id="35  010" >10</span>
 But none said, Where is God that made me, who appoints the night-watches;  <span class="verse" rel="v01835  011" id="35  011" >11</span>
 who makes me to differ from the four-footed beasts of the earth, and from the birds of the sky?  <span class="verse" rel="v01835  012" id="35  012" >12</span>
 There they shall cry, and none shall listen, even because of the insolence of wicked men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01835  013" id="35  013" >13</span>
 For the Lord desires not to look on error, for he is the Almighty One.  <span class="verse" rel="v01835  014" id="35  014" >14</span>
 He beholds them that perform lawless deeds, and he will save me: and do you plead before him, if you can praise him, as it is   possible   even now.  <span class="verse" rel="v01835  015" id="35  015" >15</span>
 For he is not   now   regarding his wrath, nor has he noticed severely any trespass.  <span class="verse" rel="v01835  016" id="35  016" >16</span>
 Yet Job vainly opens his mouth, in ignorance he multiplies words.  
<!-- 36   016 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="36  001">36  </span> And Elius further continued, and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  002" id="36  002" >2</span>
 Wait for me yet a little while, that I may teach you: for there is yet speech in me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  003" id="36  003" >3</span>
 Having fetched my knowledge from afar, and according to my works,  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  004" id="36  004" >4</span>
 I will speak just things truly, and you shall not unjustly receive unjust words.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  005" id="36  005" >5</span>
 But know that the Lord will not cast off an innocent man: being mighty in strength of wisdom,  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  006" id="36  006" >6</span>
 he will not by any means save alive the ungodly: and he will grant the judgment of the poor.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  007" id="36  007" >7</span>
 He will not turn away his eyes from the righteous, but   they shall be   with kings on the throne: and he will establish them in triumph, and they shall be exalted.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  008" id="36  008" >8</span>
 But they that are bound in fetters shall be holden in cords of poverty.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  009" id="36  009" >9</span>
 And he shall recount to them their works, and their transgressions, for such will act with violence.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  010" id="36  010" >10</span>
 But he will listen to the righteous: and he has said that they shall turn from unrighteousness.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  011" id="36  011" >11</span>
 If they should hear and serve   him  , they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in honor.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  012" id="36  012" >12</span>
 But he preserves not the ungodly; because they are not willing to know the Lord, and because when reproved they were disobedient.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  013" id="36  013" >13</span>
 And the hypocrites in heart will array wrath   against themselves  ; they will not cry, because he has bound them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  014" id="36  014" >14</span>
 Therefore let their soul die in youth, and their life be wounded by messengers   of death  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  015" id="36  015" >15</span>
 Because they afflicted the weak and helpless: and he will vindicate the judgment of the meek.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  016" id="36  016" >16</span>
 And he has also enticed you out of the mouth of the enemy:  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  017" id="36  017" >17</span>
    there is   a deep gulf   and   a rushing stream beneath it, and your table came down full of fatness. Judgment shall not fail from the righteous;  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  018" id="36  018" >18</span>
 but there shall be wrath upon the ungodly, by reason of the ungodliness of the bribes which they received for iniquities.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  019" id="36  019" >19</span>
 Let not   your   mind willingly turn you aside from the petition of the feeble that are in distress.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  020" id="36  020" >20</span>
 And draw not forth all the mighty   men   by night, so that the people should go up instead of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  021" id="36  021" >21</span>
 But take heed lest you do that which is wrong: for of this you have made choice because of poverty.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  022" id="36  022" >22</span>
 Behold, the Mighty One shall prevail by his strength: for who is powerful as he is?  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  023" id="36  023" >23</span>
 And who is he that examines his works? or who can say, he has wrought injustice?  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  024" id="36  024" >24</span>
 Remember that his works are great   beyond   those which men have attempted.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  025" id="36  025" >25</span>
 Every man has seen in himself, how many mortals are wounded.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  026" id="36  026" >26</span>
 Behold, the Mighty One is great, and we shall not know   him  : the number of his years is even infinite.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  027" id="36  027" >27</span>
 And the drops of rain are numbered by him, and shall be poured out in rain to form a cloud.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  028" id="36  028" >28</span>
 The ancient   heavens   shall flow, and the clouds overshadow innumerable mortals: he has fixed a time to cattle, and they know the order of rest.   Yet   by all these things your understanding is not astonished, neither is your mind disturbed in   your   body.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  029" id="36  029" >29</span>
 And though one should understand the outspreadings of the clouds,   or   the measure of his tabernacle;  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  030" id="36  030" >30</span>
 behold he will stretch his bow against him, and he covers the bottom of the sea.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  031" id="36  031" >31</span>
 For by them he will judge the nations: he will give food to him that has strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  032" id="36  032" >32</span>
 He has hidden the light in   his   hands, and given charge concerning it to the interposing   cloud  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01836  033" id="36  033" >33</span>
 The Lord will declare concerning this   to   his friend:   but there is   a portion also for unrighteousness.

 His dominion is under the whole heaven, and his light is at the extremities of the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01837  004" id="37  004" >4</span>
 After him shall be a cry with a   loud   voice; he shall thunder with the voice of his excellency, yet he shall not cause men to pass away, for one shall hear his voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v01837  005" id="37  005" >5</span>
 The Mighty One shall thunder wonderfully with his voice: for he has done great things which we knew not;  <span class="verse" rel="v01837  006" id="37  006" >6</span>
 commanding the snow, Be you upon the earth, and the stormy rain, and the storm of the showers of his might.  <span class="verse" rel="v01837  007" id="37  007" >7</span>
 He seals up the hand of every man, that every man may know his own weakness.  <span class="verse" rel="v01837  008" id="37  008" >8</span>
 And the wild beasts come in under the covert, and rest in   their   lair.  <span class="verse" rel="v01837  009" id="37  009" >9</span>
 Troubles come on out of the secret chambers, and cold from the mountain-tops.  <span class="verse" rel="v01837  010" id="37  010" >10</span>
 And from the breath of the Mighty One he will send frost; and he guides the water in whatever way he pleases.  <span class="verse" rel="v01837  011" id="37  011" >11</span>
 And   if   a cloud obscures   what is   precious   to him  , his light will disperse the cloud.  <span class="verse" rel="v01837  012" id="37  012" >12</span>

 this has been appointed by him on the earth, whether for correction,   or   for his land, or if he shall find him   an object   for mercy.  <span class="verse" rel="v01837  014" id="37  014" >14</span>
 Listen to this, O Job: stand still, and be admonished of the power of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01837  015" id="37  015" >15</span>
 We know that god has disposed his works, having made light out of darkness.  <span class="verse" rel="v01837  016" id="37  016" >16</span>
 And he knows the divisions of the clouds, and the signal overthrows of the ungodly.  <span class="verse" rel="v01837  017" id="37  017" >17</span>
 But your robe is warm, and there is quiet upon the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v01837  018" id="37  018" >18</span>

 Therefore teach me, what shall we say to him? and let us cease from saying much.  <span class="verse" rel="v01837  020" id="37  020" >20</span>
 Have I a book or a scribe my me, that I may stand and put man to silence?  <span class="verse" rel="v01837  021" id="37  021" >21</span>
 But the light is not visible to all: it shines afar off in the heavens, as that which is from him in the clouds.  <span class="verse" rel="v01837  022" id="37  022" >22</span>
 From the   north   come the clouds shining like gold: in these great are the glory and honor of the Almighty;  <span class="verse" rel="v01837  023" id="37  023" >23</span>

 When the stars were made, all my angels praised me with a loud voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v01838  008" id="38  008" >8</span>
 And I shut up the sea with gates, when it rushed out, coming forth out its mother's womb.  <span class="verse" rel="v01838  009" id="38  009" >9</span>
 And I made a cloud its clothing, and swathed it in mist.  <span class="verse" rel="v01838  010" id="38  010" >10</span>
 And I set bounds to it, surrounding it with bars and gates.  <span class="verse" rel="v01838  011" id="38  011" >11</span>

 The peacock has a beautiful wing: if the stork and the ostrich conceive,   it is worthy of notice  ,  <span class="verse" rel="v01839  014" id="39  014" >14</span>

 He paws exulting in the plain, and goes forth in strength into the plain.  <span class="verse" rel="v01839  022" id="39  022" >22</span>
 He laughs to scorn a king as he meets him, and will by no means turn back from the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v01839  023" id="39  023" >23</span>
 The bow and sword resound against him; and   his   rage will swallow up the ground:  <span class="verse" rel="v01839  024" id="39  024" >24</span>

 This is the chief of the creation of the Lord; made to be played with by his angels.  <span class="verse" rel="v01840  015" id="40  015" >15</span>
 And when he has gone up to a steep mountain, he causes joy to the quadrupeds in the deep.  <span class="verse" rel="v01840  016" id="40  016" >16</span>
 He lies under trees of every kind, by the papyrus, and reed, and bulrush.  <span class="verse" rel="v01840  017" id="40  017" >17</span>
 And the great trees make a shadow over him with their branches, and   so do   the bushes of the field.  <span class="verse" rel="v01840  018" id="40  018" >18</span>
 If there should be a flood, he will not perceive it; he trust that Jordan will rush up into his mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01840  019" id="40  019" >19</span>
    Yet one   shall take him in his sight;   one   shall catch   him   with a cord, and pierce his nose.  <span class="verse" rel="v01840  020" id="40  020" >20</span>
 But will you catch the serpent with a hook, and put a halter about his nose?  <span class="verse" rel="v01840  021" id="40  021" >21</span>
 Or will you fasten a ring in his nostril, and bore his lip with a clasp?  <span class="verse" rel="v01840  022" id="40  022" >22</span>
 Will he address you with a petition? softly, with the voice of a suppliant?  <span class="verse" rel="v01840  023" id="40  023" >23</span>
 And will he make a covenant with you? and will you take him for a perpetual servant?  <span class="verse" rel="v01840  024" id="40  024" >24</span>
 And will you play with him as with a bird? or bind him as a sparrow for a child?  <span class="verse" rel="v01840  025" id="40  025" >25</span>
 And do the nations feed upon him, and the nations of the Phoenicians share him?  <span class="verse" rel="v01840  026" id="40  026" >26</span>
 And all the ships come together would not be able to bear the mere skin of his tail; neither   shall they carry   his head in fishing vessels.  <span class="verse" rel="v01840  027" id="40  027" >27</span>
 But you shall lay your hand upon him   once  , remembering the war that is waged by his mouth; and let it not be done any more.

<p><span class="chapter" id="41  001">41  </span> Hast you not seen him? and have you not wondered at the things said   of him  ? Do you not fear because preparation has been made by me? for who is there that resists me?  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  002" id="41  002" >2</span>
 Or who will resist me, and abide, since the whole   world   under heaven is mine?  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  003" id="41  003" >3</span>
 I will not be silent because of him: though because of his power   one   shall pity his antagonist.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  004" id="41  004" >4</span>
 Who will open the face of his garment? and who can enter within the fold of his breastplate?  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  005" id="41  005" >5</span>
 Who will open the doors of his face? terror is round about his teeth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  006" id="41  006" >6</span>
 His inwards are as brazen plates, and the texture of his   skin   as a smyrite stone.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  007" id="41  007" >7</span>
 One   part   cleaves fast to another, and the air can’t come between them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  008" id="41  008" >8</span>
 They will remain united each to the other: they are closely joined, and can’t be separated.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  009" id="41  009" >9</span>
 At his sneezing a light shines, and his eyes are   as   the appearance of the morning star.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  010" id="41  010" >10</span>
 Out of his mouth proceed as it were burning lamps, and as it were hearths of fire are cast abroad.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  011" id="41  011" >11</span>
 Out of his nostrils proceeds smoke of a furnace burning with fire of coals.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  012" id="41  012" >12</span>
 His breath is   as   live coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  013" id="41  013" >13</span>
 And power is lodged in his neck, before him destruction runs.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  014" id="41  014" >14</span>
 The flesh also of his body is joined together:   if one   pours   violence   upon him, he shall not be moved.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  015" id="41  015" >15</span>
 His heart is firm as a stone, and it stands like an unyielding anvil.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  016" id="41  016" >16</span>
 And when he turns,   he is   a terror to the four-footed wild beasts which leap upon the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  017" id="41  017" >17</span>
 If spears should come against him,   men   will effect nothing,   either with   the spear or the breast-plate.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  018" id="41  018" >18</span>
 For he considers iron as chaff, and brass as rotten wood.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  019" id="41  019" >19</span>
 The bow of brass shall not would him, he deems a slinger as grass.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  020" id="41  020" >20</span>
 Mauls are counted as stubble; and he laughs to scorn the waving of the firebrand.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  021" id="41  021" >21</span>
 His lair is   formed of   sharp points; and all the gold of the sea under him is an immense   quantity of   clay.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  022" id="41  022" >22</span>
 He makes the deep boil like a brazen caldron; and he regards the sea as a pot of ointment,  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  023" id="41  023" >23</span>
 and the lowest part of the deep as a captive: he reckons the deep as   his   range.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  024" id="41  024" >24</span>
 There is nothing upon the earth like to him, formed to be sported with by my angels.  <span class="verse" rel="v01841  025" id="41  025" >25</span>
 He beholds every high thing: and he is king of all that are in the waters.

<p><span class="chapter" id="42  001">42  </span> Then Job answered and said to the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v01842  002" id="42  002" >2</span>
 I know that you can do all things, and nothing is impossible with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01842  003" id="42  003" >3</span>
 For who is he that hides counsel from you? or who keeps back his words, and thinks to hide them from you? and who will tell me what I knew not, great and wonderful things which I understood not?  <span class="verse" rel="v01842  004" id="42  004" >4</span>
 But hear me, O Lord, that I also may speak: and I will ask you, and do you teach me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01842  005" id="42  005" >5</span>
 I have heard the report of you by the ear before; but now my eye has seen you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01842  006" id="42  006" >6</span>
 Therefore I have counted myself vile, and have fainted: and I esteem myself dust and ashes.  <span class="verse" rel="v01842  007" id="42  007" >7</span>
 And it came to pass after the Lord had spoken all these words to Job,   that   the Lord said to Eliphaz the Thaemanite, You have sinned, and your two friends: for you° have not said anything true before me, as my servant Job   has  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01842  008" id="42  008" >8</span>
 Now then take seven bullocks, and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and he shall offer a burnt offering for you. And my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will only accept him: for but his sake, I would have destroyed you, for you° have not spoken the truth against my servant Job.  <span class="verse" rel="v01842  009" id="42  009" >9</span>
 So Eliphaz the Thaemanite, and Baldad the Sauchite, and Sophar the Minaean, went and did as the Lord commanded them: and he pardoned their sin for the sake of Job.  <span class="verse" rel="v01842  010" id="42  010" >10</span>
 And the Lord prospered Job: and when he prayed also for his friends, he forgave them   their   sin: and the Lord gave Job twice as much, even the double of what he had before.  <span class="verse" rel="v01842  011" id="42  011" >11</span>
 And all his brethren and his sisters heard all that had happened to him, and they came to him, and   so did   all that had known him from the first: and they ate and drank with him, and comforted him, and wondered at all that the Lord had brought upon him: and each one gave him a lamb, and four drachmas' weight of gold, even of unstamped   gold  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01842  012" id="42  012" >12</span>
 And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job,   more   than the beginning: and his cattle were fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, a thousand she-asses of the pastures.  <span class="verse" rel="v01842  013" id="42  013" >13</span>
 And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.  <span class="verse" rel="v01842  014" id="42  014" >14</span>
 And he called the first Day, and the second Casia, and the third Amalthaea's horn.  <span class="verse" rel="v01842  015" id="42  015" >15</span>
 And there were not found in comparison with the daughters of Job, fairer   women   than they in all the world: and their father gave them an inheritance among their brethren.  <span class="verse" rel="v01842  016" id="42  016" >16</span>
 And Job lived after   his   affliction a hundred and seventy years: and all the years he lived were two hundred and forty: and Job saw his sons and his sons' sons, the fourth generation.  <span class="verse" rel="v01842  017" id="42  017" >17</span>
 And Job died, an old man and full of days: and it is written that he will rise again with those whom the Lord raises up. This man is described in the Syriac book   as   living in the land of Ausis, on the borders of Idumea and Arabia: and his name before was Jobab; and having taken an Arabian wife, he begot a son whose name was Ennon. And he himself was the son of his father Zare, one of the sons of Esau, and of his mother Bosorrha, so that he was the fifth from Abraam. And these were the kings who reigned in Edom, which country he also ruled over: first, Balac, the son of Beor, and the name of his city was Dennaba: but after Balac, Jobab, who is called Job, and after him Asom, who was governor out of the country of Thaeman: and after him Adad, the son of Barad, who destroyed Madiam in the plain of Moab; and the name of his city was Gethaim. And   his   friends who came to him were Eliphaz, of the children of Esau, king of the Thaemanites, Baldad sovereign the Sauchaeans, Sophar king of the Minaeans.
