<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">T</span>hese   are   the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan in the desert towards the west near the Red Sea, between Pharan Tophol, and Lobon, and Aulon, and the gold works.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
    It is   a journey of eleven days from Choreb to mount Seir as far as Cades Barne.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 And it came to pass in the forties year, in the eleventh month, on the first   day   of the month, Moses spoke to all the children of Israel, according to all things which the Lord commanded him for them:  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 after he had struck Seon king of the Amorites who lived in Esebon, and Og the king of Basan who lived in Astaroth and in Edrain;  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 beyond Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 The Lord your God spoke to us in Choreb, saying, Let it suffice you  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to dwell.  </span>  to have lived   so long   in this mountain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 Turn you° and depart and enter into the mountain of the Amorites, and   go   to all that dwell near about Araba, to the mountain and the plain and to the south, and the land of the Chananites near the sea, and Antilibanus, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 Behold,   God   has delivered the land before you; go in and inherit the land, which I sware to your fathers, Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob, to give it to them and to their seed after them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I shall not be able by myself to bear you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 The Lord your God has multiplied you, and, behold, you° are today as the stars of heaven for multitude.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 The Lord God of your fathers  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   increase you.  </span>  add to you a thousand-fold more than you are, and bless you as he has spoken to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 How shall I alone be able to bear your labor, and your burden, and your gainsayings?  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   give.  </span>  Take to yourselves wise and understanding and prudent men for your tribes, and I will set your leaders over you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 And you° answered me and said, The thing which you have told us   is   good to do.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 So I took of you wise and understanding and prudent men, and I set them to rule over you as rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, and rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Perhaps, recorders:   more lit.   instructors in reading and writing.  </span>  officers to your judges.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear   causes   between your brethren, and judge rightly between a man and   his   brother, and the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   his stranger.  </span>  stranger that is with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 You shall not have respect to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a face.  </span>  persons in judgment, you shall judge  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   according to small and great.  </span>  small and great equally; you shall not shrink from before the person of a man, for the judgment is God's; and whatever matter shall be too hard for you, you° shall bring it to me, and I will hear it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 And I charged upon you at that time all the commands which you° shall perform.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 And we departed from Choreb, and went through all that great wilderness and terrible, which you° saw, by the way of the mountain of the Amorite, as the Lord our God charged us, and we came as far as Cades Barne.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 And I said to you, You° have come as far as the mountain of the Amorite, which the Lord our God gives to you:  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  021" id="1  021" >21</span>
 behold, the Lord your God has delivered to us the land before you: go up and inherit it as the Lord God of your fathers said to you; fear not, neither be afraid.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  022" id="1  022" >22</span>
 And you° all came to me, and said, Let us send men before us, and let them go up to the land for us; and let them bring back to us a report of the way by which we shall go up, and of the cities into which we shall enter.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  023" id="1  023" >23</span>
 And the saying pleased me: and I took of you twelve men, one man of a tribe.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  024" id="1  024" >24</span>
 And they turned and went up to the mountain, and they came as far as the valley of the cluster, and surveyed it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  025" id="1  025" >25</span>
 And they took in their hands of the fruit of the land, and brought it to you, and said, The land is good which the Lord our God gives us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  026" id="1  026" >26</span>
 Yet you° would not go up, but rebelled against the words of the Lord our God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  027" id="1  027" >27</span>
 And you° murmured in your tents, and said, Because the Lord hated us, he has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  028" id="1  028" >28</span>
 Whither do we go up? and your brethren drew away your heart, saying,   It is a   great nation and populous, and mightier than we; and   there are   cities great and walled up to heaven: moreover we saw there the sons of the giants.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  029" id="1  029" >29</span>
 And I said to you, Fear not, neither be you° afraid of them;  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  030" id="1  030" >30</span>
 the Lord your God who goes before your face, he shall fight against them together with you effectually, according to all that he wrought for you in the land of Egypt;  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  031" id="1  031" >31</span>
 and in this wilderness which you° saw, by the way of the mountain of the Amorite;  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See Acts 13. 18, and note in the margin of English Bible on ἐτροφόρησεν.  </span>  how the Lord your God will bear you as a nursling, as if any man should nurse his child, through all the way which you° have gone until you° came to this place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  032" id="1  032" >32</span>
 And in this matter you° believed not the Lord our God,  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  033" id="1  033" >33</span>
 who goes before you in the way to choose you a place, guiding you in fire by night, showing you the way by which you° go, and a cloud by day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  034" id="1  034" >34</span>
 And the Lord heard the voice of your words, and being greatly provoked he sware, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  035" id="1  035" >35</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   If one.  </span>  Not one of these men shall see this good land, which I sware to their fathers,  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  036" id="1  036" >36</span>
 except Chaleb the son of Jephonne, he shall see it; and to him I will give the land on which he went up, and to his sons, because he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   followed closely after the Lord.  </span>  attended to the things of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  037" id="1  037" >37</span>
 And the Lord was angry with me for your sake, saying, Neither shall you by any means enter therein.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  038" id="1  038" >38</span>
 Joshua the son of Naue, who stands by you, he shall enter in there; do you strengthen him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  039" id="1  039" >39</span>
 And every young child who this day knows not good or evil, —they shall enter therein, and to them I will give it, and they shall inherit it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  040" id="1  040" >40</span>
 And you° turned and marched into the wilderness, in the way by the Red Sea.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  041" id="1  041" >41</span>
 And you° answered and said, We have sinned before the Lord our God; we will go up and fight according to all that the Lord our God has commanded us: and having taken every one his weapons of war, and being gathered together, you°  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   go up.  </span>  went up to the mountain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  042" id="1  042" >42</span>
 And the Lord said to me, Tell them, You° shall not go up, neither shall you° fight, for I am not with you; thus shall you° not be destroyed before your enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  043" id="1  043" >43</span>
 And I spoke to you, and you° did not listen to me; and you° transgressed the commandment of the Lord; and you° forced your way and went up into the mountain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  044" id="1  044" >44</span>
 And the Amorite who lived in that mountain came out to meet you, and pursued you as bees do, and wounded you from Seir to Herma.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  045" id="1  045" >45</span>
 And you° sat down and wept before the Lord our God, and the Lord listened not to your voice, neither did he take heed to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0051  046" id="1  046" >46</span>
 And you° lived in Cades many days, as many days as you° lived   there  .  
<!-- 2   046 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> And we turned and departed into the wilderness, by the way of the Red Sea, as the Lord spoke to me, and we compassed mount Seir many days.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 And the Lord said to me,  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   Let it suffice you to compass.  </span>  You° have compassed this mount long enough; turn therefore toward the north.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 And charge the people, saying, You° are going through the borders of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they shall fear you, and dread you greatly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 Do not engage in war against them, for I will not give you of their land even enough to set your foot upon, for I have given mount Seir to the children of Esau as an inheritance.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 Buy food of them for money and eat, and you° shall receive water of them by measure for money, and drink.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 For the Lord our God has blessed you in every work of your hands. Consider how you went through that great and terrible wilderness: behold, the Lord your God   has been   with you forty years; you did not lack any thing.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 And we passed by our brethren the children of Esau, who lived in Seir, by the way of Araba from Aelon and from Gesion Gaber; and we turned and passed by the way of the desert of Moab.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 And the Lord said to me, Do not you° quarrel with the Moabites, and do not engage in war with them; for I will not give you of their land for an inheritance, for I have given Aroer to the children of Lot to inherit.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 Formerly the Ommin lived in it, a great and numerous nation and powerful, like the Enakim.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 These also shall be accounted  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. giants.  </span>  Raphain like the Enakim; and the Moabites call them Ommin.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 And the Chorrhite lived in Seir before, and the sons of Esau destroyed them, and utterly consumed them from before them; and they lived in their place, as Israel did to the land of his inheritance, which the Lord gave to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 Now then, arise you°,   said I  , and depart, and cross the valley of Zaret.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 And the days in which we traveled from Cades Barne till we crossed the valley of Zaret,   were   thirty and eight years, until the whole generation of the men of war failed, dying out of the camp, as the Lord God sware to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 And the hand of the Lord was upon them to destroy them out of the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 And it came to pass when all the men of war dying out of the midst of the people had fallen,  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 that the Lord spoke to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 You shall pass over this day the borders of Moab  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   even Aroer.  </span>  to Aroer;  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 and you° shall draw near to the children of Amman: do not quarrel with them, nor wage war with them; for I will not give you of the land of the children of Amman for an inheritance, because I have given it to the children of Lot for an inheritance.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 It shall be accounted a land of Raphain, for the Raphain lived there before, and the Ammanites call them Zochommin.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 A great nation and populous, and mightier than you, as also the Enakim: yet the Lord destroyed them from before them, and they inherited   their land  , and they lived   there   instead of them until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 As they did to the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, even as they destroyed the Chorrhite from before them, and inherited  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   them.  </span>  their country, and lived   therein   instead of them until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  023" id="2  023" >23</span>
 And the Evites who dwell in Asedoth to Gaza, and the Cappadocians who came out of Cappadocia, destroyed them, and lived in their room.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  024" id="2  024" >24</span>
 Now then arise and depart, and pass over the valley of Arnon: behold, I have delivered into your hands Seon the king of Esebon the Amorite, and his land: begin to inherit   it  : engage in war with him this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  025" id="2  025" >25</span>
 Begin to put your terror and your fear on the face of all the nations under heaven, who shall be troubled when they have heard your name, and shall be in anguish  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   for fear of you.

 And I sent ambassadors from the wilderness of Kedamoth to Seon king of Esebon with peaceful words, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  027" id="2  027" >27</span>
 I will pass through your land: I will go by the road, I will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  028" id="2  028" >28</span>
 You shall give me food for money, and I will eat; and you shall give me water for money, and I will drink; I will only go through on my feet:  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  029" id="2  029" >29</span>
 as the sons of Esau did to me, who lived in Seir, and the Moabites who lived in Aroer, until I shall have passed Jordan into the land which the Lord our God gives us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  030" id="2  030" >30</span>
 And Seon king of Esebon would not that we should pass by him, because the Lord our God hardened his spirit, and made his heart stubborn, that he might be delivered into your hands, as on this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  031" id="2  031" >31</span>
 And the Lord said to me, Behold, I have begun to deliver before you Seon the king of Esebon the Amorite, and his land, and do you begin to inherit his land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  032" id="2  032" >32</span>
 And Seon the king of Esebon came forth to meet us, he and all his people to war at Jassa.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  033" id="2  033" >33</span>
 And the Lord our God delivered him before our face, and we struck him, and his sons, and all his people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  034" id="2  034" >34</span>
 And we took possession of all his cities at that time, and we utterly destroyed every city in succession, and their wives, and their children; we left no living prey.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  035" id="2  035" >35</span>
 Only we took the cattle captive, and took the spoil of the cities.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  036" id="2  036" >36</span>
 From Aroer, which is by the brink of the brook of Arnon, and the city which is in the valley, and as far as the mount of Galaad; there was not a city which escaped us: the Lord our God delivered all of them into our hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v0052  037" id="2  037" >37</span>
 Only we did not draw near to the children of Amman, even all the parts bordering on the brook Jaboc, and the cities in the mountain country, as the Lord our God charged us.

<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> And we turned and went by the way leading to Basan; and Og the king of Basan came out to meet us, he and all his people, to battle at Edraim.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 And the Lord said to me, Fear him not, for I have delivered him, and all his people, and all his land, into your hands; and you shall do to him as you did to Seon king of the Amorites who lived in Esebon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 And the Lord our God delivered him into our hands, even Og the king of Basan, and all his people; and we struck him until we left none of his seed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 And we mastered all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we took not from them; sixty cities, all the country round about Argob, belonging to king Og in Basan:  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 all strong cities, lofty walls, gates and bars; besides the very many cities of the Pherezites.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 We utterly destroyed   them   as we dealt with Seon the king of Esebon, so we utterly destroyed every city in order, and the women and the children,  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 and all the cattle; and we took for a prey to ourselves the spoil of the cities.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 And we took at that time the land out of the hands of the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan,   extending   from the brook of Arnon even to Aermon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 The Phoenicians call Aermon Sanior, but the Amorite has called it Sanir.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 All the cities of Misor, and all Galaad, and all Basan as far as Elcha and Edraim, cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 For only Og the king of Basan was left of the Raphain: behold, his bed   was   a bed of iron; behold,   it is   in the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   acropolis, citadel: or extremity of the land of the Ammonites.  </span>  chief city of the children of Ammon; the length of it   is   nine cubits, and the breadth of it four cubits, according to the cubit of a man.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 And we inherited that land at that time from Aroer, which is by the border of the torrent Arnon, and half the mount of Galaad; and I gave his cities to Ruben and to Gad.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 And the rest of Galaad, and all Basan the kingdom of Og I gave to the half-tribe of Manasse, and all the country round about Argob, all that Basan; it shall be accounted the land of Raphain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 And Jair the son of Manasse took all the country round about Argob as far as the borders of Gargasi and Machathi: he called them by his name Basan Thavoth Jair until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 And to Machir I gave Galaad.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 And to Ruben and to Gad I gave   the land   under Galaad as far as the brook of Arnon, the border between the brook and as far as Jaboc; the brook   is   the border to the children Amman.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 And Araba and Jordan   are   the boundary of Machanareth, even to the sea of Araba, the salt sea under Asedoth Phasga eastward.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 And I charged you at that time, saying, The Lord your God has given you this land by lot; arm yourselves, every one   that is   powerful, and go before your brethren the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  019" id="3  019" >19</span>
 Only your wives and your children and your cattle (I know that you° have much cattle), let them dwell in your cities which I have given you;  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  020" id="3  020" >20</span>
 until the Lord your God give your brethren rest, as also he has given to you, and they also shall inherit the land, which the Lord our God gives them on the other side of Jordan; then you° shall return, each one to his inheritance which I have given you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  021" id="3  021" >21</span>
 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen all things, which the Lord our God did to these two kings: so shall the Lord our God do to all the kingdoms against which you cross over there.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  022" id="3  022" >22</span>
 You° shall not be afraid of them, because the Lord our God himself shall fight for you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  023" id="3  023" >23</span>
 And I implored the Lord at that time, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  024" id="3  024" >24</span>
 Lord God, you have begun to show to your servant your strength, and your power, and your mighty hand, and your high arm: for what God is there in heaven or on the earth, who will do as you have done, and according to your might?  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  025" id="3  025" >25</span>
 I will therefore go over and see this good land that is beyond Jordan, this good mountain and Antilibanus.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  026" id="3  026" >26</span>
 And the Lord because of you did not regard me, and listened not to me; and the Lord said to me, Let it suffice you, speak not of this matter to me any more.  <span class="verse" rel="v0053  027" id="3  027" >27</span>

 Your eyes have seen all that the Lord our God did in   the case of   Beel-phegor; for every man that went after Beel-phegor, the Lord your God has utterly destroyed him from among you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0054  004" id="4  004" >4</span>

 Take heed to yourself, and keep your  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   soul.  </span>  heart diligently: forget not any of the things, which your eyes have seen, and let them not depart from your heart all the days of your life; and you shall teach your sons and your sons' sons,  <span class="verse" rel="v0054  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
    even the things that happened in   the day in which you° stood before the Lord our God in Choreb in the day of the assembly; for the Lord said to me, Gather the people to me, and let them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days which they live upon the earth, and they shall teach their sons.  <span class="verse" rel="v0054  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 And you° drew near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire up to heaven:   there was   darkness, blackness,   and   tempest.  <span class="verse" rel="v0054  012" id="4  012" >12</span>

 And I stood between the Lord and you at that time to report to you the words of the Lord, (because you° were afraid before the fire, and you° went not up to the mountain) saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0055  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.  <span class="verse" rel="v0055  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 You shall have no other gods before my face.  <span class="verse" rel="v0055  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 You shall not make to yourself an image, nor likeness of any thing, whatever things   are   in the heaven above, and whatever   are   in the earth beneath, and whatever   are   in the waters under the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0055  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 You shall not bow down to them, nor shall you serve them; for I am the Lord your God, a jealous God, visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation to them that hate me,  <span class="verse" rel="v0055  010" id="5  010" >10</span>

 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the Lord your God commanded you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0055  013" id="5  013" >13</span>
 Six days you shall work, and you shall do all your works;  <span class="verse" rel="v0055  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 but on the seventh day   is   the sabbath of the Lord your God: you shall do in it no work, you, and your son, and your daughter, your man-servant, and your maidservant, your ox, and your ass, and all your cattle, and the stranger that sojourns in the midst of you; that your man-servant may rest, and your maid, and your ox, as well as you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0055  015" id="5  015" >15</span>
 And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out thence with a mighty hand, and a high arm: therefore the Lord appointed you to keep the sabbath day and to sanctify it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0055  016" id="5  016" >16</span>

 You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0055  021" id="5  021" >21</span>
 You shall not covet your neighbor's wife; you shall not covet your neighbor's house, nor his field, nor his man-servant, nor his maid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any beast of his, nor any thing that is your neighbor's.  <span class="verse" rel="v0055  022" id="5  022" >22</span>
 These words the Lord spoke to all the assembly of you in the mountain out of the midst of the fire—  there was   darkness, blackness, storm, a loud voice—and he added no more, and he wrote them on two tables of stone, and he gave them to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0055  023" id="5  023" >23</span>

 and the Lord your God shall deliver them into your hands, then you shall strike them: you shall utterly destroy them: you shall not make a covenant with them, neither shall you° pity them:  <span class="verse" rel="v0057  003" id="7  003" >3</span>

 For you are a holy people to the Lord your God; and the Lord your God chose you to be to him a peculiar people beyond all nations that   are   upon the face of the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0057  007" id="7  007" >7</span>
 It was not because you° are more numerous than all   other   nations that the Lord preferred you, and the Lord made choice of you: for you° are fewer in number than all   other   nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0057  008" id="7  008" >8</span>
 But because the Lord loved you, and as keeping the oath which he sware to your fathers, the Lord brought you out with a strong hand, and the Lord redeemed you from the house of bondage, out of the hand of Pharao king of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v0057  009" id="7  009" >9</span>

 And you shall remember all the way which the Lord your God led you in the wilderness, that he might afflict you, and try you, and that the things in your heart might be made manifest, whether you would keep his commandments or no.  <span class="verse" rel="v0058  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 And he afflicted you and straitened you with hunger, and fed you with manna, which your fathers knew not; that he might teach you that          Matt 4:4    man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God shall man live.  <span class="verse" rel="v0058  004" id="8  004" >4</span>

 And you shall know today, that the Lord your God he shall go before your face: he is a consuming fire; he shall destroy them, and he shall turn them back before you, and shall destroy them quickly, as the Lord said to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  004" id="9  004" >4</span>
 Speak not in your heart, when the Lord your God has destroyed these nations before your face, saying, For my righteousness the Lord brought me in to inherit this good land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  005" id="9  005" >5</span>
 Not for your righteousness, nor for the holiness of your heart, do you go in to inherit their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations the Lord will destroy them from before you, and that he may establish the covenant, which the Lord sware to our fathers, to Abraam, and to Isaac, and to Jacob.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
 And you shall know today, that   it is   not for your righteousnesses the Lord your God gives you this good land to inherit, for you are a stiff-necked people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 Remember, forget not, how much you provoked the Lord your God in the wilderness: from the day that you° came forth out of Egypt, even till you° came into this place, you° continued to be disobedient toward the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 Also in Choreb you° provoked the Lord, and the Lord was angry with you to destroy you;  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 when I went up into the mountain to receive the tables of stone, the tables of the covenant, which the Lord made with you, and I was in the mountain forty days and forty nights, I ate no bread and drank no water.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  010" id="9  010" >10</span>
 And the Lord gave me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God, and on them there had been written all the words which the Lord spoke to you in the mountain in the day of the assembly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  011" id="9  011" >11</span>
 And it came to pass after forty days and forty nights, the Lord gave me the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  012" id="9  012" >12</span>
 And the Lord said to me, Arise, go down quickly from hence, for your people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt have transgressed; they have gone aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them, and have made themselves a molten image.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  013" id="9  013" >13</span>
 And the Lord spoke to me, saying, I have spoken to you once and again, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  014" id="9  014" >14</span>
 And now suffer me utterly to destroy them, and I will blot out their name from under heaven, and will make of you a nation great and strong, and more numerous than this.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  015" id="9  015" >15</span>
 And I turned and went down from the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to heaven; and the two tables of the testimonies   were    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   on.  </span>  in my two hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  016" id="9  016" >16</span>
 And when I saw that you° had sinned against the Lord your God, and had made to yourselves a molten image, and had gone astray out of the way, which the Lord commanded you to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to do.  </span>  keep;  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  017" id="9  017" >17</span>
 then I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  018" id="9  018" >18</span>
 And I made my petition before the Lord as also at the first forty days and forty nights: I ate no bread and drank no water, on account of all your sins which you° sinned in doing evil before the Lord God to provoke him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  019" id="9  019" >19</span>
 And I  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   am.  </span>  was greatly terrified because of the wrath and anger, because the Lord was provoked with you utterly to destroy you; yet the Lord listened to me at this time also.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  020" id="9  020" >20</span>
 And he was angry with Aaron to destroy him utterly, and I prayed for Aaron also at that time.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  021" id="9  021" >21</span>
 And your sin which you° had made,   even   the calf, I took, and burnt it with fire, and pounded it and ground it down till it became fine; and it became like dust, and I cast the dust into the brook that descended from the mountain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  022" id="9  022" >22</span>
 Also in the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. Taberah, Massah, and Kibroth Hattavah.  </span>  burning, and in the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. Taberah, Massah, and Kibroth Hattavah.  </span>  temptation, and at the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. Taberah, Massah, and Kibroth Hattavah.  </span>  graves of lust, you° provoked the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  023" id="9  023" >23</span>
 And when the Lord sent you forth from Cades Barne, saying, Go up and inherit the land which I give to you, then you° disobeyed the word of the Lord your God, and believed him not, and listened not to his voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  024" id="9  024" >24</span>
 You° were disobedient  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   towards the Lord.  </span>  in the things relating to the Lord from the day in which he became known to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  025" id="9  025" >25</span>
 And I prayed before the Lord forty days and forty nights, the number that I prayed   before  , for the Lord said that he would utterly destroy you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  026" id="9  026" >26</span>
 And I prayed to God, and said, O Lord, King of gods, destroy not your people and your  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   portion or part.  </span>  inheritance, whom you did redeem, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with your great power, and with your strong hand, and with your high arm.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  027" id="9  027" >27</span>
 Remember Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob your servants, to whom you sware by yourself: look not upon the hardness of heart of this people, and their impieties, and their sins.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  028" id="9  028" >28</span>
 Lest the inhabitants of the land whence you brought us out speak, saying, Because the Lord could not bring them into the land of which he spoke to them, and because he hated them, has he brought them forth to kill them in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0059  029" id="9  029" >29</span>
 And these   are   your people and your portion, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with your great strength, and with your mighty hand, and with your high arm.  
<!-- 10   029 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="10  001">10  </span> At that time the Lord said to me, Hew for yourself two stone tables as the first, and come up to me into the mountain, and you shall make for yourself an ark of wood.  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  002" id="10  002" >2</span>
 And you shall write upon the tables the words which were on the first tables which you did break, and you shall put them into the ark.  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  003" id="10  003" >3</span>
 So I made an ark of boards of incorruptible wood, and I hewed tables of stone like the first, and I went up to the mountain, and the two tables were in my hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  004" id="10  004" >4</span>
 And he wrote upon the tables according to the first writing the ten commandments, which the Lord spoke to you in the mountain out of the midst of the fire, and the Lord gave them to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  005" id="10  005" >5</span>
 And I turned and came down from the mountain, and I put the tables into the ark which I had made; and there they were, as the Lord commanded me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  006" id="10  006" >6</span>
 And the children of Israel departed from Beeroth of the sons of Jakim   to   Misadai: there Aaron died, and there he was buried, and Eleazar his son was priest in his stead.  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  007" id="10  007" >7</span>
 Thence they departed to Gadgad; and from Gadgad to Etebatha, a land   wherein are   torrents of water.  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  008" id="10  008" >8</span>
 At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand near before the Lord, to minister and bless in his name to this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  009" id="10  009" >9</span>
 Therefore the Levites have no part nor inheritance among their brethren; the Lord himself   is   their inheritance, as he said to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  010" id="10  010" >10</span>
 And I  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   stood.  </span>  remained in the mount forty days and forty nights: and the Lord heard me at that time also, and the Lord would not destroy you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  011" id="10  011" >11</span>
 And the Lord said to me, Go, set out before this people, and let them go in and inherit the land, which I sware to their fathers to give to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  012" id="10  012" >12</span>
 And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you, but to fear the Lord your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul;  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  013" id="10  013" >13</span>
 to keep the commandments of the Lord your God, and his ordinances, all that I charge you today, that it may be well with you?  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  014" id="10  014" >14</span>
           1 Cor 10:26,28    Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens belong to the Lord your God, the earth and all things that are in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  015" id="10  015" >15</span>
 Only the Lord chose your fathers to love them, and he chose out their seed after them,   even   you, beyond all nations, as at this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  016" id="10  016" >16</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and.  </span>  Therefore you° shall circumcise the hardness of your heart, and you° shall not harden your neck.  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  017" id="10  017" >17</span>
 For the Lord your God, he   is   God of gods, and the Lord of lords, the great, and strong, and terrible God, who does not  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   wonder at or admire a face.  </span>  accept persons, nor will he by any means accept a bribe:  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  018" id="10  018" >18</span>
 executing judgment for the stranger and orphan and widow, and he loves the stranger to give him food and raiment.  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  019" id="10  019" >19</span>
 And you° shall love the stranger; for you° were strangers in the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  020" id="10  020" >20</span>
 You shall fear the Lord your God, and serve him, and shall cleave to him, and shall swear by his name.  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  021" id="10  021" >21</span>
 He   is   your boast, and he   is   your God, who has wrought in the midst of you these great and glorious things, which your eyes have seen.  <span class="verse" rel="v00510  022" id="10  022" >22</span>
 With seventy souls your fathers went down into Egypt; but the Lord your God has made you as the stars of heaven in multitude.

<p><span class="chapter" id="11  001">11  </span> Therefore you shall love the Lord your God, and shall observe his appointments, and his ordinances, and his commandments, and his judgments, always.  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  002" id="11  002" >2</span>
 And you° shall know this day; for   I speak   not to your children, who know not and have not seen the discipline of the Lord your God, and his wonderful works, and his strong hand, and his high arm,  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  003" id="11  003" >3</span>
 and his miracles, and his wonders, which he wrought in the midst of Egypt on Pharao king of Egypt, and all his land;  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  004" id="11  004" >4</span>
 and what he did to the host of the Egyptians, and to their chariots, and their cavalry, and their host; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overwhelm the face of them as they pursued after you, and the Lord destroyed them until this day;  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  005" id="11  005" >5</span>
 and all the things which he did to you in the wilderness until you° came into this place;  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  006" id="11  006" >6</span>
 and all the things that he did to Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab the son of Ruben, whom the earth opening her mouth swallowed up, and their houses, and their tents, and all their substance that was with them, in the midst of all Israel:  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  007" id="11  007" >7</span>
 for your eyes have seen all the mighty works of the Lord, which he wrought among you today.  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  008" id="11  008" >8</span>
 And you° shall keep all his commandments, as many as I command you today, that you° may live, and be multiplied, and that you° may go in and inherit the land, into which you° go across Jordan to inherit it:  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  009" id="11  009" >9</span>
 that you° may live long upon the land, which the Lord sware to your fathers to give to them, and to their seed after them, a land flowing with milk and honey.  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  010" id="11  010" >10</span>
 For the land into which you go to inherit it, is not as the land of Egypt, whence you° came out, whenever they sow the seed, and water it with their feet, as a garden of herbs:  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  011" id="11  011" >11</span>
 but the land into which you go to inherit it, is a land of mountains and plains; it shall drink water of the rain of heaven.  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  012" id="11  012" >12</span>
 A land which the Lord your God surveys continually, the eyes of the Lord your God are upon it from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  013" id="11  013" >13</span>
 Now if you° will indeed listen to all the commands which I charge you this day, to love the Lord your God, and to serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul,  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  014" id="11  014" >14</span>
 then he shall give to your land the early and latter rain in its season, and you shall bring in your corn, and your wine, and your oil.  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  015" id="11  015" >15</span>
 And he shall give food in your fields to your cattle; and when you have eaten and are full,  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  016" id="11  016" >16</span>
 take heed to yourself that your heart be not  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">           Gr.    made broad.  </span>  puffed up, and you° transgress, and serve other gods, and worship them:  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  017" id="11  017" >17</span>
 and the Lord be angry with you, and restrain the heaven; and there shall not be rain, and the earth shall not yield its fruit, and you° shall perish quickly from off the good land, which the Lord has given you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  018" id="11  018" >18</span>
 And you° shall store these words in your heart and in your soul, and you° shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and it shall be fixed before your eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  019" id="11  019" >19</span>
 And you° shall teach them to your children, so as to speak about them when you sit in the house, and when you walk by the way, and when you sleep, and when you rise up.  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  020" id="11  020" >20</span>
 And you° shall write them on the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   thresholds.  </span>  lintels of your houses, and on your gates;  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  021" id="11  021" >21</span>
 that your days may be long, and the days of your children, upon the land which the Lord sware to your fathers to give to them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  022" id="11  022" >22</span>
 And it shall come to pass that if you° will indeed listen to all these commands, which I charge you to observe this day, to love the Lord our God, and to walk in all his ways, and to cleave close to him;  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  023" id="11  023" >23</span>
 then the Lord shall cast out all these nations before you, and you° shall inherit great nations and stronger than yourselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  024" id="11  024" >24</span>
 Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be your; from the wilderness and Antilibanus, and from the great river, the river Euphrates, even as far as the west sea shall be your coasts.  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  025" id="11  025" >25</span>
 No one shall stand before you; and the Lord your God will put the fear of you and the dread of you on the face of all the land, on which you° shall tread, as he told you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  026" id="11  026" >26</span>
 Behold, I set before you this day the blessing and the curse;  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  027" id="11  027" >27</span>
 the blessing, if you° listen to the commands of the Lord your God, all that I command you this day;  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  028" id="11  028" >28</span>
 and the curse, if you° do not listen to the commands of the Lord our God, as many as I command you this day, and you° wander from the way which I have commanded you, having gone to serve other gods, which you° know not.  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  029" id="11  029" >29</span>
 And it shall come to pass when the Lord your God shall have brought you into the land into which you go over to inherit it, then you shall put blessing on mount Garizin, and the curse upon mount Gaebal.  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  030" id="11  030" >30</span>
 Behold! are not these beyond Jordan, behind, westward in the land of Chanaan, which lies westward near Golgol, by the high oak?  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  031" id="11  031" >31</span>
 For you° are passing over Jordan, to go in and inherit the land, which the Lord our God gives you to inherit always, and you° shall dwell in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00511  032" id="11  032" >32</span>
 And you° shall take heed to do all his ordinances, and these judgments, as many as I set before you today.

<p><span class="chapter" id="12  001">12  </span> And these   are   the ordinances and the judgments, which you° shall observe to do in the land, which the Lord God of your fathers gives you for an inheritance, all the days which you° live upon the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00512  002" id="12  002" >2</span>
 You° shall utterly destroy all the places in which they served their gods, whose   land   you° inherit, on the high mountains and on the hills, and under the thick tree.  <span class="verse" rel="v00512  003" id="12  003" >3</span>
 And you° shall destroy their altars, and break in pieces their pillars, and you° shall cut down their groves, and you° shall burn with fire the graven images of their gods, and you° shall abolish their name out of that place.  <span class="verse" rel="v00512  004" id="12  004" >4</span>
 You° shall not do so to the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00512  005" id="12  005" >5</span>
 But in the place which the Lord your God shall choose in one of your cities to name his name there, and to be called upon, you° shall even seek   him   out and go there.  <span class="verse" rel="v00512  006" id="12  006" >6</span>
 And you° shall carry there your whole burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your first fruits, and your  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   vows.  </span>  vowed-offerings, and your free will offerings, and your offerings of thanksgiving, the firstborn of your herds, and of your flocks.  <span class="verse" rel="v00512  007" id="12  007" >7</span>
 And you° shall eat there before the Lord your God, and you° shall rejoice in all the things on which you° shall lay your hand, you° and your houses, as the Lord your God has blessed you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00512  008" id="12  008" >8</span>
 You° shall not do altogether as we do here today, every man that which is pleasing in his own sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v00512  009" id="12  009" >9</span>
 For hitherto you° have not arrived at the rest and the inheritance, which the Lord our God gives you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00512  010" id="12  010" >10</span>
 And you° shall go over Jordan, and shall dwell in the land, which the Lord our God takes as an inheritance for you; and he shall give you rest from all your enemies round about, and you° shall dwell safely.  <span class="verse" rel="v00512  011" id="12  011" >11</span>
 And there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose for his name to be called there, there shall you° bring all things that I order you today; your whole burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the first fruits of your hands, and every choice gift of yours, whatever you° shall vow to the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00512  012" id="12  012" >12</span>
 And you° shall rejoice before the Lord your God, you° and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants and your maidservants, and the Levite that is at your gates; because he has no portion or inheritance with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00512  013" id="12  013" >13</span>
 Take heed to yourself that you offer not your whole burnt offerings in any place which you shall see;  <span class="verse" rel="v00512  014" id="12  014" >14</span>
 save in the place which the Lord your God shall choose, in one of your tribes, there shall you° offer your whole burnt offerings, and there shall you do all things whatever I charge you this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00512  015" id="12  015" >15</span>
 But you shall kill according to all your desire, and shall eat flesh according to the blessing of the Lord your God, which he has given you in every city; the unclean that is within you and the clean shall eat it on equal terms, as the doe or the stag.  <span class="verse" rel="v00512  016" id="12  016" >16</span>

 And if the Lord your God shall utterly destroy the nations, to whom you go in there to inherit their land, from before you, and you shall inherit it, and dwell in their land;  <span class="verse" rel="v00512  030" id="12  030" >30</span>

 And   these things   shall be signs in you, and wonders among your seed for ever;  <span class="verse" rel="v00528  047" id="28  047" >47</span>

 And you shall serve your enemies, which the Lord will send forth against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in the lack of all things; and you shall wear upon your neck a yoke of iron until he shall have destroyed you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00528  049" id="28  049" >49</span>
 The Lord shall bring upon you a nation from the extremity of the earth, like the swift flying of an eagle, a nation whose voice you shall not  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   bear.  </span>  understand;  <span class="verse" rel="v00528  050" id="28  050" >50</span>

 And you shall eat the fruit of your  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   belly.  </span>  body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, all that he has given you, in your straitness and your affliction, with which your enemy shall afflict you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00528  054" id="28  054" >54</span>

 so as   not   to give to one of them of the flesh of his children, whom he shall eat, because of his having nothing left him in your straitness, and in your affliction, with which your enemies shall afflict you in all your cities.  <span class="verse" rel="v00528  056" id="28  056" >56</span>
 And she that is tender and delicate among you, whose foot has not assayed to go upon the earth for delicacy and tenderness, shall look with an evil eye on her husband in her bosom, and her son and her daughter,  <span class="verse" rel="v00528  057" id="28  057" >57</span>
 and her  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   afterbirth.  </span>  offspring that comes out between her feet, and the child which she shall bear; for she shall eat them because of the lack of all things, secretly in your straitness, and in your affliction, with which your enemy shall afflict you in your cities.  <span class="verse" rel="v00528  058" id="28  058" >58</span>
 If you will not listen to do all the words of this law, which have been written in this book, to fear this glorious and wonderful name, the Lord your God;  <span class="verse" rel="v00528  059" id="28  059" >59</span>

 And the Lord your God shall scatter you among all nations, from one end of the earth to the other; and you shall there serve other gods, wood and stone, which you have not known, nor your fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v00528  065" id="28  065" >65</span>
 Moreover among those nations he will not give you quiet, neither by any means shall the sole of your foot have rest; and the Lord shall give you there another and a misgiving heart, and failing eyes, and a wasting soul.  <span class="verse" rel="v00528  066" id="28  066" >66</span>
 And your life shall be in suspense before your eyes; and you shall be afraid by day and by night, and you shall have no assurance of your life.  <span class="verse" rel="v00528  067" id="28  067" >67</span>
 In the morning you shall say, Would it were evening! and in the evening you shall say, Would it were morning! for the fear of your heart with which you shall fear, and for the sights of your eyes which you shall see.  <span class="verse" rel="v00528  068" id="28  068" >68</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="29  001">29  </span> These   are   the words of the covenant, which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them in Choreb.  <span class="verse" rel="v00529  002" id="29  002" >2</span>
 And Moses called all the sons of Israel and said to them, You° have seen all things that the Lord did in the land of Egypt before you to Pharao and his servants, and all his land;  <span class="verse" rel="v00529  003" id="29  003" >3</span>
 the great temptations which your eyes have seen, the signs, and those great wonders.  <span class="verse" rel="v00529  004" id="29  004" >4</span>
 Yet the Lord God has not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00529  005" id="29  005" >5</span>
 And he led you forty years in the wilderness; your garments did not grow old, and your sandals were not worn away off your feet.  <span class="verse" rel="v00529  006" id="29  006" >6</span>
 You° did not eat bread, you° did not drink wine or strong drink, that you° might know that I   am   the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00529  007" id="29  007" >7</span>
 And you° came as far as this place; and there came forth Seon king of Esebon, and Og king of Basan, to meet us in war.  <span class="verse" rel="v00529  008" id="29  008" >8</span>
 And we struck them and took their land, and I gave it for an inheritance to Ruben and Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasse.  <span class="verse" rel="v00529  009" id="29  009" >9</span>
 And you° shall take heed to do all the words of this covenant, that you° may understand all things that you° shall do.  <span class="verse" rel="v00529  010" id="29  010" >10</span>
 You° all stand today before the Lord your God, the heads of your tribes, and your elders, and your judges, and your officers, every man of Israel,  <span class="verse" rel="v00529  011" id="29  011" >11</span>

 that you should enter into the covenant of the Lord your God and into his oaths, as many as the Lord your God appoints you this day;  <span class="verse" rel="v00529  013" id="29  013" >13</span>

 And you° [*]saw their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which are among them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00529  018" id="29  018" >18</span>
 Lest there be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart has turned aside from the Lord your God, having gone to serve the gods of these nations; lest there be in you a root springing up with gall and bitterness.  <span class="verse" rel="v00529  019" id="29  019" >19</span>
 And it shall be if one shall hear the words of this curse, and shall flatter himself in his heart, saying,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.

 God shall by no means be willing to pardon him, but then the wrath of the Lord and his jealousy shall flame out against that man; and all the curses of this covenant shall attach themselves to him, which are written in this book, and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven.  <span class="verse" rel="v00529  021" id="29  021" >21</span>

 And   men   shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord God of their fathers, the things which he appointed to their fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt:  <span class="verse" rel="v00529  026" id="29  026" >26</span>
 and they went and served other gods, which they knew not, neither did he assign   them   to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00529  027" id="29  027" >27</span>
 And the Lord was exceedingly angry with that land to bring upon it according to all the curses which are written in the book of this law.  <span class="verse" rel="v00529  028" id="29  028" >28</span>
 And the Lord removed them from their land in anger, and wrath, and very great indignation, and cast them out into another land as at present.  <span class="verse" rel="v00529  029" id="29  029" >29</span>

 The Lord your God who goes before you, he shall destroy these nations before you, and you shall inherit them: and   it shall be   Joshua that goes before your face, as the Lord has spoken.  <span class="verse" rel="v00531  004" id="31  004" >4</span>

 Be courageous and strong, fear not, neither be cowardly neither be afraid before them; for   it is   the Lord your God that advances with you in the midst of you,          Heb 13:5    neither will he by any means forsake you, nor desert you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00531  007" id="31  007" >7</span>

 For I will bring them into the good land, which I sware to their fathers, to give to them a land flowing with milk and honey: and they shall eat and be filled and satisfy   themselves  ; then will they turn aside after other gods, and serve them, and they will provoke me, and break my covenant.  <span class="verse" rel="v00531  021" id="31  021" >21</span>
 And this song shall stand up to witness against them; for they shall not forget it out of their mouth, or out of the mouth of their seed; for I know their wickedness, what they are doing here this day, before I have brought them into the good land, which I sware to their fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v00531  022" id="31  022" >22</span>

 And the Lord said to Moses, This   is   the land of which I sware to Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob, saying, To your seed will I give it: and I have showed it to your eyes, but you shall not go in there.  <span class="verse" rel="v00534  005" id="34  005" >5</span>
