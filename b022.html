<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Song of songs, which is Solomon's.  <span class="verse" rel="v0221  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for your breasts are better than wine.  <span class="verse" rel="v0221  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 And the smell of your ointments is better than all spices: your name is ointment poured forth; therefore do the young maidens love you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0221  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 They have drawn you: we will run after you, for the smell of your ointments: the king has brought me into closet: let us rejoice and be glad in you; we will love your breasts more than wine: righteousness loves you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0221  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 I am black, but beautiful, you° daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0221  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 Look not upon me, because I am dark, because the sun has looked unfavourably upon me: my mother's sons strove with me; they made me keeper in the vineyards; I have not kept my own vineyard.  <span class="verse" rel="v0221  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 Tell me,   you   whom my soul loves, where you tend your flock, where you cause   them   to rest at noon, lest I become as one that is veiled by the flocks of your companions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0221  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 If you know not yourself, you fair one among women, go you forth by the footsteps of the flocks, and feed your kids by the shepherd's tents.  <span class="verse" rel="v0221  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 I have likened you, my companion, to my horses in the chariots of Pharao.  <span class="verse" rel="v0221  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 How are your cheeks beautiful as   those   of a dove, your neck as chains!  <span class="verse" rel="v0221  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 We will make you figures of gold with studs of silver.  <span class="verse" rel="v0221  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 So long as the king was at table, my spikenard gave forth its smell.  <span class="verse" rel="v0221  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 My kinsman is to me a bundle of myrrh; he shall lie between my breasts.  <span class="verse" rel="v0221  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 My kinsman is to me a cluster of camphor in the vineyards of Engaddi.  <span class="verse" rel="v0221  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 Behold, you are fair, my companion; behold, you are fair; your eyes are doves.  <span class="verse" rel="v0221  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 Behold, you are fair, my kinsman, yes, beautiful, overshadowing our bed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0221  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 The beams of our house are cedars, our ceilings are of cypress.

<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> I am a flower of the plain, a lily of the valleys.  <span class="verse" rel="v0222  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 As a lily among thorns, so is my companion among the daughters.  <span class="verse" rel="v0222  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 As the apple among the trees of the wood, so is my kinsman among the sons. I desired his shadow, and sat down, and his fruit was sweet in my throat.  <span class="verse" rel="v0222  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 Bring me into the wine house; set love before me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0222  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 Strengthen me with perfumes, stay me with apples: for I   am   wounded with love.  <span class="verse" rel="v0222  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 His left   hand shall be   under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0222  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 I have charged you, you° daughters of Jerusalem, by the powers and by the virtues of the field, that you° do not rouse or wake   my   love, until he please.  <span class="verse" rel="v0222  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 The voice of my kinsman! behold, he comes leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills.  <span class="verse" rel="v0222  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 My kinsman is like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Baethel: behold, he is behind our wall, looking through the windows, peeping through the lattices.  <span class="verse" rel="v0222  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 My kinsman answers, and says to me, Rise up, come, my companion, my fair one, my dove.  <span class="verse" rel="v0222  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 For, behold, the winter is past, the rain is gone, it has departed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0222  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 The flowers are seen in the land; the time of pruning has arrived; the voice of the turtle-dove has been heard in our land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0222  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 The fig tree has put forth its young figs, the vines put forth the tender grape, they yield a smell: arise, come, my companion, my fair one, my dove; yes, come.  <span class="verse" rel="v0222  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
    You are   my dove, in the shelter of the rock, near the wall: show me your face, and cause me to hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your countenance is beautiful.  <span class="verse" rel="v0222  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 Take us the little foxes that spoil the vines: for our vines put forth tender grapes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0222  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 My kinsman is mine, and I am his: he feeds   his flock   among the lilies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0222  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 Until the day dawn, and the shadows depart, turn, my kinsman, be you like to a roe or young hart on the mountains of the ravines.

<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but found him not; I called him, but he listened not to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0223  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 I will rise now, and go about in the city, in the marketplaces, and in the streets, and I will seek him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0223  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 The watchmen who go their rounds in the city found me.   I said  , Have you° seen him whom my soul loves?  <span class="verse" rel="v0223  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
    It was   as a little   while   after I parted from them, that I found him whom my soul loves: I held him, and did not let him go, until I brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0223  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 I have charged you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the powers and by the virtues of the field, that you° rouse not nor awake   my   love, until he please.  <span class="verse" rel="v0223  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 Who is this that comes up from the wilderness as pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the perfumer?  <span class="verse" rel="v0223  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 Behold Solomon's bed; sixty mighty men of the mighty ones of Israel are round about it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0223  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 They all hold a sword, being expert in war: every man   has   his sword upon his thigh because of fear by night.  <span class="verse" rel="v0223  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 King Solomon made himself a litter of woods of Lebanon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0223  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 He made the pillars of it silver, the bottom of it gold, the covering of it scarlet, in the midst of it a pavement of love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0223  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 Go forth, you° daughters of Sion, and behold king Solomon, with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him, in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.  
<!-- 4   011 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> Behold, you are fair, my companion; behold, you are fair; your eyes are doves, beside your veil: your hair is as flocks of goats, that have appeared from Galaad.  <span class="verse" rel="v0224  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 Your teeth are as flocks of shorn   sheep  , that have gone up from the washing; all of them bearing twins, and there is not a barren one among them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0224  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 Your lips are as a thread of scarlet, and your speech is comely: like the rind of a pomegranate is your cheek without your veil.  <span class="verse" rel="v0224  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 Your neck is as the tower of David, that was built for an armory: a thousand shields hang upon it,   and   all darts of mighty men.  <span class="verse" rel="v0224  005" id="4  005" >5</span>
 Your two breasts are as two twin fawns, that feed among the lilies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0224  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 Until the day dawn, and the shadows depart, I will betake me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.  <span class="verse" rel="v0224  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 You are all fair, my companion, and there is no spot in you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0224  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 Come from Libanus,   my   bride, come from Libanus: you shall come and pass from the top of Faith, from the top of Sanir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.  <span class="verse" rel="v0224  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 My sister,   my   spouse, you have ravished my heart; you have ravished my heart with one of your eyes, with one chain of your neck.  <span class="verse" rel="v0224  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 How beautiful are your breasts, my sister, my spouse! how much more beautiful are your breasts than wine, and the smell of your garments than all spices!  <span class="verse" rel="v0224  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 Your lips drop honeycomb, my spouse: honey and milk are under your tongue; and the smell of your garments is as the smell of Libanus.  <span class="verse" rel="v0224  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 My sister,   my   spouse is a garden enclosed; a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0224  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 Your shoots are a garden of pomegranates, with the fruit of choice berries; camphor, with spikenard:  <span class="verse" rel="v0224  014" id="4  014" >14</span>
 spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon; with all woods of Libanus, myrrh, aloes, with all chief spices:  <span class="verse" rel="v0224  015" id="4  015" >15</span>
 a fountain of a garden, and a well of water springing and gurgling from Libanus.  <span class="verse" rel="v0224  016" id="4  016" >16</span>
 Awake, O north wind; and come, O south; and blow through my garden, and let my spices flow out.  
<!-- 5   016 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> Let my kinsman come down into his garden, and eat the fruit of his choice berries. I am come into my garden, my sister,   my   spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spices; I have eaten my bread with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends, and drink; yes, brethren, drink abundantly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0225  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 I sleep, but my heart is awake: the voice of my kinsman knocks at the door,   saying  , Open, open to me, my companion, my sister, my dove, my perfect one: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.  <span class="verse" rel="v0225  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them?  <span class="verse" rel="v0225  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 My kinsman put forth his hand by the hole   of the door  , and my belly moved for him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0225  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 I rose up to open to my kinsman; my hands dropped myrrh, my fingers choice myrrh, on the handles of the lock.  <span class="verse" rel="v0225  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 I opened to my kinsman; my kinsman was gone: my soul failed at his speech: I sought him, but found him not; I called him, but he answered me not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0225  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 The watchman that go their rounds in the city found me, they struck me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0225  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 I have charged you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the powers and the virtues of the field: if you° should find my kinsman, what are you° to say to him? That I am wounded with love.  <span class="verse" rel="v0225  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 What is your kinsman   more   than   another   kinsman, O you beautiful among women? what is your kinsman   more   than   another   kinsman, that you have so charged us?  <span class="verse" rel="v0225  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 My kinsman is white and ruddy, chosen out from myriads.  <span class="verse" rel="v0225  011" id="5  011" >11</span>
 His head is   as   very fine gold, his locks are flowing, black as a raven.  <span class="verse" rel="v0225  012" id="5  012" >12</span>
 His eyes are as doves, by the pools of waters, washed with milk, sitting by the pools.  <span class="verse" rel="v0225  013" id="5  013" >13</span>
 His cheeks are as bowls of spices pouring forth perfumes: his lips are lilies, dropping choice myrrh.  <span class="verse" rel="v0225  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 His hands are as turned gold set with beryl: his belly is an ivory tablet on a sapphire stone.  <span class="verse" rel="v0225  015" id="5  015" >15</span>
 His legs are marble pillars set on golden sockets: his form is as Libanus, choice as the cedars.  <span class="verse" rel="v0225  016" id="5  016" >16</span>
 His throat is most sweet, and altogether desirable. This is my kinsman, and this is my companion, O daughters of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0225  017" id="5  017" >17</span>
 Whither is your kinsman gone, you beautiful among women? whither has your kinsman turned aside?   tell us  , and we will seek him with you.

 I am my kinsman's, and my kinsman is mine, who feeds among the lilies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0226  003" id="6  003" >3</span>

 Turn away your eyes from before me, for they have ravished me: your hair is as flocks of goats which have appeared from Galaad.  <span class="verse" rel="v0226  005" id="6  005" >5</span>
 Your teeth are as flocks of shorn   sheep  , that have gone up from the washing, all of them bearing twins, and there is none barren among them: your lips are as a thread of scarlet, and your speech is comely.  <span class="verse" rel="v0226  006" id="6  006" >6</span>
 Your cheek is like the rind of a pomegranate,   being seen   without your veil.  <span class="verse" rel="v0226  007" id="6  007" >7</span>
 There are sixty queens, and eighty concubines, and maidens without number.  <span class="verse" rel="v0226  008" id="6  008" >8</span>
 My dove, my perfect one is one; she is the   only   one of her mother; she is the choice of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and the queens will pronounce her blessed, yes, and the concubines, and they will praise her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0226  009" id="6  009" >9</span>
 Who is this that looks forth as the morning, fair as the moon, choice as the sun, terrible as   armies   set in array?  <span class="verse" rel="v0226  010" id="6  010" >10</span>
 I went down to the garden of nuts, to look at the fruits of the valley, to see if the vine flowered,   if   the pomegranates blossomed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0226  011" id="6  011" >11</span>
 There I will give you my breasts: my soul knew   it   not: it made me as the chariots of Aminadab.  <span class="verse" rel="v0226  012" id="6  012" >12</span>
 Return, return, O Sunamite; return, return, and we will look at you. What will you° see in the Sunamite? She comes as bands of armies.

<p><span class="chapter" id="7  001">7  </span> Your steps are beautiful in shoes, O daughter of the prince: the joints of   your   thighs are like chains, the work of the craftsman.  <span class="verse" rel="v0227  002" id="7  002" >2</span>
 Your navel is   as   a turned bowl, not lacking liquor; your belly is   as   a heap of wheat set about with lilies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0227  003" id="7  003" >3</span>
 Your two breasts are as two twin fawns.  <span class="verse" rel="v0227  004" id="7  004" >4</span>
 Your neck is as an ivory tower; your eyes are as pools in Esebon, by the gates of the daughter of many: your nose is as the tower of Libanus, looking toward Damascus.  <span class="verse" rel="v0227  005" id="7  005" >5</span>
 Your head upon you is as Carmel, and the curls of your hair like scarlet; the king is bound in the galleries.  <span class="verse" rel="v0227  006" id="7  006" >6</span>
 How beautiful are you, and how sweet are you,   my   love!  <span class="verse" rel="v0227  007" id="7  007" >7</span>
 This is your greatness in your delights: you were made like a palm tree, and your breasts to cluster.  <span class="verse" rel="v0227  008" id="7  008" >8</span>
 I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of its high boughs: and now shall your breasts be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of your nose of apples;  <span class="verse" rel="v0227  009" id="7  009" >9</span>
 and your throat as good wine, going well with my kinsman, suiting my lips and teeth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0227  010" id="7  010" >10</span>
 I am my kinsman's, and his desire is toward me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0227  011" id="7  011" >11</span>
 Come, my kinsman, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.  <span class="verse" rel="v0227  012" id="7  012" >12</span>
 Let us go early into the vineyards; let us see if the vine has flowered,   if   the blossoms have appeared, if the pomegranates have blossomed; there will I give you my breasts.  <span class="verse" rel="v0227  013" id="7  013" >13</span>
 The mandrakes have given a smell, and at our doors   are   all kinds of choice fruits, new and old. O my kinsman, I have kept   them   for you.

<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> I would that you, O my kinsman, were he that sucked the breasts of my mother; when I found you without, I would kiss you; yes, they should not despise me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0228  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 I would take you, I would bring you into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me; I would make you to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranates.  <span class="verse" rel="v0228  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 His left hand   should be   under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0228  004" id="8  004" >4</span>
 I have charged you, you° daughters of Jerusalem, by the virtues of the field, that you° stir not up, nor awake   my   love, until he please.  <span class="verse" rel="v0228  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 Who is this that comes up all white, leaning on her kinsman? I raised you up under an apple tree; there your mother brought you forth; there she that bore you brought you forth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0228  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm; for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave, her shafts are shafts of fire,   even   the flames thereof.  <span class="verse" rel="v0228  007" id="8  007" >7</span>
 Much water will not be able to quench love, and rivers shall not drown it; if a man would give all his substance for love,   men   would utterly despise it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0228  008" id="8  008" >8</span>
 Our sister is little, and has no breasts; what shall we do for our sister, in the day wherein she shall be spoken for?  <span class="verse" rel="v0228  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 If she is a wall, let us build upon her silver bulwarks; and if she is a door, let us carve for her cedar panels.  <span class="verse" rel="v0228  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 I am a wall, and my breasts are as towers; I was in their eyes as one that found peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0228  011" id="8  011" >11</span>
 Solomon had a vineyard in Beelamon; he let his vineyard to keepers; every one was to bring for its fruit a thousand   pieces   of silver.  <span class="verse" rel="v0228  012" id="8  012" >12</span>
 My vineyard, even mine, is before me; Solomon   shall have   a thousand, and they that keep its fruit two hundred.  <span class="verse" rel="v0228  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 You that dwell in the gardens, the companions listen to your voice: make me hear   it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0228  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 Away, my kinsman, and be like a doe or a fawn on the mountains of spices.
