<h2>(1 Samuel) </h2>
<!-- 1   001 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">T</span>here was a man of Armathaim Sipha, of mount Ephraim, and his name   was   Helkana, a son of Jeremeel the son of Elias the son of Thoke, in Nasib Ephraim.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 And he   had   two wives; the name of the one   was   Anna, and the name of the second Phennana. And Phennana had children, but Anna had no child.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 And the man went up  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from days to days.  </span>  from year to year from his city, from Armathaim, to worship and sacrifice to the Lord God of Sabaoth at Selom: and   there were   Heli and his two sons Ophni and Phinees, the priests of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And the day came, and Helkana sacrificed, and gave portions to his wife Phennana and her children.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 And to Anna he gave  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   one portion.  </span>  a prime portion, because she had no child, only Helkana loved Anna more than the other; but the Lord   had   closed her womb.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 For the Lord gave her no child in her affliction, and according to the despondency of her affliction; and she was dispirited on this account, that the Lord shut up her womb so as not to give her a child.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 So she did year by year, in going up to the house of the Lord; and she was dispirited, and wept, and did not eat.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 And Helkana her husband said to her, Anna: and she said to him, Here   am   I, my lord: and he said to her, What ails you that you weep? and why do you not eat? and why does your heart strike you?   am   I not better to you than ten children?  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 And Anna rose up after they had eaten in Selom, and stood before the Lord: and Heli the priest   was   on a seat by the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   lintels.  </span>  threshold of the temple of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 And she   was   very much grieved in spirit, and prayed to the Lord, and wept abundantly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 And she vowed a vow to the Lord, saying, O Lord God of Sabaoth, if you welt indeed look upon the humiliation of your handmaid, and remember me, and give to your handmaid a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   seed of men.  </span>  boy, then will I indeed dedicate him to you till the day of his death; and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink, and no  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   iron.  </span>  razor shall come upon his head.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 And it came to pass, while she was long praying before the Lord, that Heli the priest marked her mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 And she was speaking in her heart, and her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: and Heli accounted her a drunken woman.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 And the servant of Heli said to her, How long will you be drunken? take away your wine from you, and go out from the presence of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 And Anna answered and said, Nay, my lord,   I live    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Comp.   ἐν σκληρᾳ ἡμέρᾳ.  </span>  in a hard day, and I have not drunk wine or strong drink, and I pour out my soul before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   give not.  </span>  Count not your handmaid for a pestilent woman, for by reason of the abundance of my importunity I have continued   my prayer   until now.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 And Heli answered and said to her, Go in peace: the God of Israel give you all your petition, which you have asked of him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 And she said, Your handmaid has found favor in your eyes: and the woman went her way, and entered into her lodging, and ate and drank with her husband, and her countenance was no more sad.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 And they rise early in the morning, and worship the Lord, and they go their way: and Helkana went into his house at Armathaim, and knew his wife Anna; and the Lord remembered her, and she conceived.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 And it came to pass  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in the season of days.  </span>  when the time was come, that she brought forth a son, and called his name Samuel, and said, Because I asked him of the Lord God of Sabaoth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  021" id="1  021" >21</span>
 And the man Helkana and all his house went up to offer in Selom the yearly sacrifice, and his vows, and all the tithes of his land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  022" id="1  022" >22</span>
 But Anna did not go up with him, for she said to her husband,   I will not go up   until the child goes up, when I have weaned him, and he shall be presented before the Lord, and he shall abide there continually.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  023" id="1  023" >23</span>
 And Helkana her husband said to her, Do that which is good in your eyes, abide still until you shall have weaned him; but may the Lord establish that which comes out of your mouth: and the woman tarried, and suckled her son until she had weaned him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  024" id="1  024" >24</span>
 And she went up with him to Selom with a calf  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   in its third year.  </span>  of three years old, and loaves, and an ephah of fine flour, and a bottle of wine: and she entered into the house of the Lord in Selom, and the child with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  025" id="1  025" >25</span>
 And they brought him before the Lord; and his father killed his offering which he offered from year to year to the Lord; and he brought near the child, and killed the calf; and Anna the mother of the child brought him to Heli.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  026" id="1  026" >26</span>
 And she said, I pray you, my lord, as your soul lives, I   am   the woman that stood in your presence with you while praying to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  027" id="1  027" >27</span>
 For this child I prayed; and the Lord has given me my request that I asked of him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0091  028" id="1  028" >28</span>
 And I lend him to the Lord all his days that he lives, a loan to the Lord: and she said,  
<!-- 2   028 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> My heart is established in the Lord, my horn is exalted in my God; my mouth is enlarged over my enemies, I have rejoiced in your salvation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 For there is none holy as the Lord, and there is none righteous as our God; there is none holy besides you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 Boast not, and utter not high things; let not high-sounding words come out of your mouth, for the Lord   is   a God of knowledge, and God prepares his own designs.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 The bow of the mighty has waxed feeble, and the weak have girded themselves with strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 They that were full of bread are brought low; and the hungry have forsaken the land; for the barren has born seven, and she that abounded in children has waxed feeble.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 The Lord kills and makes alive; he brings down to the grave, and brings up.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 The Lord makes poor, and makes rich; he brings low, and lifts up.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 He lifts up the poor from the earth, and raises the needy from the dunghill; to seat him with the princes of the people, and causing them to inherit the throne of glory:  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 granting his petition to him that prays; and he blesses the years of the righteous, for by strength can’t man prevail.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 The Lord will weaken his adversary; the Lord   is   holy. Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, nor let the mighty man boast in his strength, and let not the rich man boast in his wealth; but let him that boasts boast in this, to understand and know the Lord,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Perhaps   'and the Lord executes,' etc. Comp. Jer. 9. 24. </span>  and to execute judgment and justice in the midst of the earth. The Lord has gone up to the heavens, and has thundered: he will judge the extremities of the earth, and he gives strength to our kings, and will exalt the horn of his Christ. And she left him there before the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 and departed to Armathaim: and the child ministered in the presence of the Lord before Heli the priest.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 And the sons of Heli the priest   were   evil sons, not knowing the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 And the priest's claim from every one of the people that sacrificed   was this:   the servant of the priest came when the flesh was in seething, and a flesh-hook of three teeth   was   in his hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 And he struck it into the great caldron, or into the brazen vessel, or into the pot, and whatever came up with the flesh-hook, the priest took for himself: so they did to all Israel that came to sacrifice to the Lord in Selom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 And before the fat was burnt for a sweet savor, the servant of the priest would come, and say to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, and I will by no means take of you sodden flesh out of the caldron.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 And   if   the man that sacrificed said, First let the fat be burned, as it is fit, and take for yourself of all things which your soul desires: then he would say, Nay, for you shall give it me now; and if not I will take it by force.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 So the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord, for they set at nothing the offering of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 And Samuel ministered before the Lord, a child girded with a linen ephod.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 And his mother made him a little doublet, and brought it to him from  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   days to days.  </span>  year to year, in her going up in company with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 And Heli blessed Helcana and his wife, saying The Lord recompense to you seed of this woman, in return for the loan which you have lent to the Lord: and the man returned to his place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 And the Lord visited Anna, and she bore yet three sons, and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 And Heli   was   very old, and he heard what his sons did to the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  023" id="2  023" >23</span>
 And he said to them, Why do you° according to this thing, which I hear from the mouth of all the people of the Lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  024" id="2  024" >24</span>
 Nay   my   sons, for the report which I hear   is   not good; do not so, for  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   the reports which I hear of the people not serving, etc. Comp. 1 Ch. 13. .4 </span>  the reports which I hear   are   not good, so that the people do not serve God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  025" id="2  025" >25</span>
 If a man should at all sin against another, then shall they pray for him to the Lord; but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him? But they listened not to the voice of their father, because the Lord would by all means destroy them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  026" id="2  026" >26</span>
 And the child Samuel advanced, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   was good.  </span>  was in favor with God and with men.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  027" id="2  027" >27</span>
 And a man of God came to Heli, and said, Thus says the Lord, I plainly revealed myself to the house of your father, when they were servants in Egypt to the house of Pharao.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  028" id="2  028" >28</span>
 And I chose the house of your father out of all the tribes of Israel to minister to me in the priest's office, to go up to my altar, and to burn incense, and to wear an ephod. And I gave to the house of your father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel for food.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  029" id="2  029" >29</span>
 And therefore have you looked upon my incense-offering and my meat-offering with a shameless eye, and have honored your sons above me, so that they should bless themselves with the first fruits of every sacrifice of Israel before me?  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  030" id="2  030" >30</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord God of Israel, I said, Your house and the house of your father shall pass before me for ever: but now the Lord says, That be far from me; for I will only honor them that honor me, and he that sets me at nothing shall be despised.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  031" id="2  031" >31</span>
 Behold, the days come when I will destroy your seed and the seed of your father's house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  032" id="2  032" >32</span>
 And you shall not have an old man in my house for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  033" id="2  033" >33</span>
 And   if   I do not destroy a man of your from my altar,   it shall be   that his eyes may fail and his soul may perish; and every one that remains in your house shall fall by the sword of men.  <span class="verse" rel="v0092  034" id="2  034" >34</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> And the child Samuel ministered to the Lord before Heli the priest: and the word of the Lord was precious in those days, there was no  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   distinguishing.  </span>  distinct vision.  <span class="verse" rel="v0093  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 And it came to pass at that time that Heli was sleeping in his place; and his eyes began to fail, and could not see.  <span class="verse" rel="v0093  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 And the lamp of God   was burning   before it was trimmed, and Samuel slept in the temple, where   was   the ark of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0093  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 And the Lord called, Samuel, Samuel; and he said, Behold,   here am   I.  <span class="verse" rel="v0093  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 And he ran to Heli, and said,   Here am   I, for you did call me: and he said, I did not call you; return, go to sleep; and he returned and went to sleep.  <span class="verse" rel="v0093  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 And the Lord  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   added and called.  </span>  called again, Samuel, Samuel: and he went to Heli the second time, and said, Behold   here am   I, for you did call me: and he said, I called you not; return, go to sleep.  <span class="verse" rel="v0093  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 And   it was   before Samuel knew the Lord, and   before   the word of the Lord was revealed to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0093  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 And the Lord called Samuel again for the third time: and he arose and went to Heli, and said, Behold, I   am here  , for you did call me: and Heli perceived that the Lord   had   called the child.  <span class="verse" rel="v0093  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 And he said, Return, child, go to sleep; and it shall come to pass if he shall call you, that you shall say, Speak for your servant hears: and Samuel went and lay down in his place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0093  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 And the Lord came, and stood, and called him as  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   once and once.  </span>  before: and Samuel said, Speak, for your servant hears.  <span class="verse" rel="v0093  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 And the Lord said to Samuel, Behold, I execute my words in Israel; whoever hears them, both his ears shall tingle.  <span class="verse" rel="v0093  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 In that day I will raise up against Heli all things that I have said against his house; I will begin, and I will make an end.  <span class="verse" rel="v0093  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 And I have told him that I will be avenged on his house perpetually for the iniquities of his sons, because his sons spoke evil against God, and he did not admonish them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0093  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 And   it shall   not   go on   so; I have sworn to the house of Eli, the iniquity of the house of Eli shall not be atoned for with incense or sacrifices for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0093  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 And Samuel  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   sleeps   or   lies down.  </span>  slept till morning, and rose early in the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the Lord; and Samuel feared to tell   Heli   the vision.  <span class="verse" rel="v0093  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 And Heli said to Samuel, Samuel,   my   son; and he said, Behold,   here am   I.  <span class="verse" rel="v0093  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 And he said, What   was   the word that was spoken to you?

 And Samuel reported all the words, and hid them not from him. And Heli said, He   is   the Lord, he shall do that which is good in his sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v0093  019" id="3  019" >19</span>
 And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and there did not fall one of his words to the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v0093  020" id="3  020" >20</span>
 And all Israel knew from Dan even to Bersabee, that Samuel   was   faithful as a prophet to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0093  021" id="3  021" >21</span>
 And the Lord manifested himself again in Selom, for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel; and Samuel was accredited to all Israel as a prophet to the Lord from one end of the land to the other: and Heli   was   very old, and his sons kept advancing   in wickedness  , and their way   was   evil before the Lord.

 And the people came to the camp, and the elders of Israel said, Why has the Lord caused us to fall this day before the Philistines? let us take the ark of our God out of Selom, and let it proceed from the midst of us, and it shall save us from the hand of our enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0094  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 And the people sent to Selom, and they take thence the ark of the Lord who dwells between the cherubs: and both the sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees,   were   with the ark.  <span class="verse" rel="v0094  005" id="4  005" >5</span>

 Woe to us, O Lord, deliver us today for such a thing has not happened aforetime: woe to us, who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these   are   the Gods that struck Egypt with every plague, and in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0094  009" id="4  009" >9</span>

 And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the battle, and he came to Selom on that day: and his clothes   were   tore, and earth   was   upon his head.  <span class="verse" rel="v0094  013" id="4  013" >13</span>

 And Heli heard the sound of the cry, and said, What   is   the voice of this cry? and the men hasted and went in, and reported to Heli.  <span class="verse" rel="v0094  015" id="4  015" >15</span>

 And the Philistines took the ark of the Lord, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0095  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 And the people of Azotus rose early, and entered into the house of Dagon; and looked, and behold, Dagon had fallen on his face before the ark of the Lord: and they lifted up Dagon, and set him in his place. And the hand of the Lord was heavy upon the Azotians, and he plagued them, and he struck them in their secret parts, Azotus and her coasts.  <span class="verse" rel="v0095  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 And it came to pass when they rose early in the morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face before the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands   were   cut off each before the threshold, and both the wrists of his hands had fallen on the floor of the porch; only the stump of Dagon was left.  <span class="verse" rel="v0095  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 Therefore the priests of Dagon, and every one that enters into the house of Dagon, do not tread upon the threshold of the house of Dagon in Azotus until this day, for they step over.  <span class="verse" rel="v0095  006" id="5  006" >6</span>

 And it came to pass after it went about to Geth, that the hand of the Lord comes upon the city, a very great confusion; and he struck the men of the city small and great, and struck them in their secret parts: and the Gittites made to themselves images of tumors.  <span class="verse" rel="v0095  010" id="5  010" >10</span>

 So the Lord humbled the Philistines, and they did not anymore come into the border of Israel; and the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0097  014" id="7  014" >14</span>
 And the cities which the Philistines took from the children of Israel were restored; and they restored them to Israel from  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.   from Accaron to Geth. So the   Heb.  </span>  Ascalon to Azob: and they took the coast of Israel out of the hand of the Philistines; and there was peace between Israel and the Amorite.  <span class="verse" rel="v0097  015" id="7  015" >15</span>
 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.  <span class="verse" rel="v0097  016" id="7  016" >16</span>
 And he went year by year, and went round Baethel, and Galgala, and Massephath; and he judged Israel in all these consecrated places.  <span class="verse" rel="v0097  017" id="7  017" >17</span>
 And his return was to Armathaim, because there was his house; and there he judged Israel, and built there an altar to the Lord.

<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> And it came to pass when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 And these   are   the names of his sons; Joel the firstborn, and the name of the second Abia, judges in Bersabee.  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 And his sons did not walk in his way; and they turned aside after gain, and took gifts, and perverted judgments.  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  004" id="8  004" >4</span>
 And the men of Israel gather themselves together, and come to Armathaim to Samuel,  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 and they said to him, Behold, you are grown old, and your sons walk not in your way; and now set over us a king to judge us, as also the other nations   have  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 And the thing   was   evil in the eyes of Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us: and Samuel prayed to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  007" id="8  007" >7</span>
 And the Lord said to Samuel, Hear the voice of the people, in whatever they shall say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from reigning over them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  008" id="8  008" >8</span>
 According to all their doings which they have done to me, from the day that I brought them out of Egypt until this day, even   as   they have deserted me, and served other gods, so they do also to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 And now listen to their voice; only you shall solemnly testify to them, and you shall  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   report.  </span>  describe to them the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   judgment.  </span>  manner of the king who shall reign over them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 And Samuel spoke every word of the Lord to the people who asked of him a king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  011" id="8  011" >11</span>
 And he said, This shall be the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   judgment.  </span>  manner of the king that shall rule over you: he shall take your sons, and put them in his chariots, and among his horsemen, and running before his chariots,  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  012" id="8  012" >12</span>
 and   his manner shall be   to make them to himself captains of hundreds and captains of thousands; and to reap his harvest, and gather his vintage, and prepare his instruments of war, and the implements of his chariots.  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and cooks, and bakers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your good olive yards, and give them to his servants.  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  015" id="8  015" >15</span>
 And he will take the tithe of your seeds and your vineyards, and give   it   to his eunuchs, and to his servants.  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  016" id="8  016" >16</span>
 And he will take your servants, and your handmaids, and your good herds and your asses, and will take the tenth of them for his works.  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  017" id="8  017" >17</span>
 And he will tithe your flocks; and you° shall be his servants.  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  018" id="8  018" >18</span>
 And you° shall cry out in that day because of your king whom you° have chosen to yourselves, and the Lord shall not hear you in those days, because you° have chosen to yourselves a king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  019" id="8  019" >19</span>
 But the people would not listen to Samuel; and they said to him, Nay, but there shall be a king over us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  020" id="8  020" >20</span>
 An we also will be like all the nations; and our king shall judge us, and shall go out before us, and fight our  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   war.  </span>  battles.  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  021" id="8  021" >21</span>
 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and spoke them in the ears of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0098  022" id="8  022" >22</span>
 And the Lord said to Samuel, Listen to their voice, and appoint them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Let each man depart to his city.

<p><span class="chapter" id="9  001">9  </span> And   there was   a man of the sons of Benjamin, and his name   was   Kis, the son of Abiel, the son of Jared, the son of Bachir, the son of Aphec, the son of a Benjamite, a man of might.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  002" id="9  002" >2</span>
 And this man   had   a son, and his name was Saul, of great stature, a goodly man; and there was not among the sons of Israel a goodlier than he, high above all the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   land.  </span>  people  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from above his shoulders.  </span>  from his shoulders and upward.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  003" id="9  003" >3</span>
 And the asses of Kis the father of Saul were lost; and Kis said to Saul his son, Take with you one of the young men, and arise you°, and go seek the asses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  004" id="9  004" >4</span>
 And they went through mount Ephraim, and they went through the land of Selcha, and found them not: and they passed through the land of Segalim, and they were not there: and they passed through the land of Jamin, and found them not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  005" id="9  005" >5</span>
 And when they came to Siph, then Saul said to his young man that was with him, Come and let us return, lest my father leave the asses, and take care for us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
 And the young man said to him, Behold now,   there is   a man of God in this city, and the man   is   of high repute; all that he shall speak will surely come to pass: now then let us go, that he may tell us our way on which we have set out.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 And Saul said to his young man that was with him, Behold, then, we will go; but what shall we bring the man of God? for the loaves are spent out of our vessels, and we have nothing more with us that belongs to us to bring to the man of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 And the young man answered Saul again, and said, Behold, there is found in my hand a fourth part of a shekel of silver; and you shall give it to the man of God, and he shall tell us our way.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 Now before time in Israel every one in going to enquire of God said, Come and let us go to the seer; for the people beforetime called the prophet, the seer.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  010" id="9  010" >10</span>
 And Saul said to his servant, Well said, come and let us go: and they went to the city where the man of God was.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  011" id="9  011" >11</span>
 As they went up the ascent to the city, they find damsels come out to draw water, and they say to them, Is the seer here?  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  012" id="9  012" >12</span>
 And the virgins answered them, and they say to them, He is: behold,   he is   before you: now he is coming to the city, because of the day, for today   there is   a sacrifice for the people in Bama.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  013" id="9  013" >13</span>
 As soon as you° shall enter into the city, so shall you° find him in the city, before he goes up to Bama to eat; for the people will not eat until he comes in, for he blesses the sacrifice, and afterwards the guests eat; now then go up, for you° shall find him because of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   day.  </span>  holiday.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  014" id="9  014" >14</span>
 And they go up to the city; and as they were entering into the midst of the city, behold, Samuel came out to meet them, to go up to Bama.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  015" id="9  015" >15</span>
 And the Lord uncovered the ear of Samuel  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   the day before.  </span>  one day before Saul came to him, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  016" id="9  016" >16</span>
 At this time to-morrow I will send to you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be ruler over my people Israel, and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon the humiliation of my people, for their cry is come to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  017" id="9  017" >17</span>
 And Samuel looked upon Saul, and the Lord answered him, Behold the man of whom I spoke to you, this one shall rule over my people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  018" id="9  018" >18</span>
 And Saul  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   brought near.  </span>  drew near to Samuel into the midst of the city, and said, Tell me now  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   of what kind?  </span>  which   is   the house of the seer?  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  019" id="9  019" >19</span>
 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am he: go up before me to Bama, and eat with me today, and I will send you away in the morning, and I will tell you all that is in your heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  020" id="9  020" >20</span>
 And concerning your asses that have been lost now these three days, care not for them, for they are found. And to whom does the excellency of Israel belong? does it not to you and to your father's house?  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  021" id="9  021" >21</span>
 And Saul answered and said, Am not I the son of a Benjamite, the least tribe of the people of Israel? and of the least family of the whole tribe of Benjamin? and why have you spoken to me according to this word?  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  022" id="9  022" >22</span>
 And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them to the inn, and set them there a place among the chief of those that were called, about seventy men.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  023" id="9  023" >23</span>
 And Samuel said to the cook, Give me the portion which I gave you, which I told you to set by you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  024" id="9  024" >24</span>
 Now the cook   had   boiled the shoulder, and he set it before Saul; and Samuel said to Saul, Behold that which is left: set before you, an eat; for it is set you for a testimony in preference to the others;  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   pinch.  </span>  take   of it  : and Saul ate with Samuel on that day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  025" id="9  025" >25</span>
 And he went down from Bama into the city; and they prepared a lodging for Saul on the roof, and he lay down.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  026" id="9  026" >26</span>
 An it came to pass when the morning  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   went up.  </span>  dawned, that Samuel called Saul on the roof, saying, Rise up, and I will dismiss you. And Saul arose, and he and Samuel went out.  <span class="verse" rel="v0099  027" id="9  027" >27</span>
 As they went down to a part of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Speak to the young man, and let him pass on before us; and do you stand as today, and listen to the word of God.

<p><span class="chapter" id="10  001">10  </span> And Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured   it   on his head, and kissed him, and said to him, Has not the Lord anointed you for a ruler over his people, over Israel? and you shall rule among the people of the Lord, and you shall save them out of the hand of their enemies; and this   shall be   the sign to you that the Lord has anointed you for a ruler over his inheritance.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  002" id="10  002" >2</span>
    As soon   as you shall have departed this day from me, you shall find two men by the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   burial places.  </span>  burial-place of Rachel on the mount of Benjamin, exulting greatly; and they shall say to you, The asses are found which you° went to seek; and, behold, your father has given up the matter of the asses, and he is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  003" id="10  003" >3</span>
 And you shall depart thence, and shall go beyond that as far as the oak of Thabor, and you shall find there three men going up to God to Baethel, one bearing three kids, and another bearing three vessels of bread, and another bearing a bottle of wine.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  004" id="10  004" >4</span>
 And they shall ask you how you do, and shall give you two presents of bread, and you shall receive them of their hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  005" id="10  005" >5</span>
 And afterward you shall go to the hill of God, where is the encampment of the Philistines; there   is   Nasib the Philistine: an it shall come to pass when you° shall have entered into the city, that you shall meet a band of prophets coming down from the Bama; and before them will be lutes, and a drum, and a pipe, and a harp, and they  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   prophesying.  </span>  shall prophesy.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  006" id="10  006" >6</span>
 And the Spirit of the Lord shall  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   leap upon you.  </span>  come upon you, and you shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  007" id="10  007" >7</span>
 And it shall come to pass when these signs shall come upon you, —  then   do you whatever your hand shall find, because God   is   with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  008" id="10  008" >8</span>
 And you shall go down in front of Galgal, and behold, I come down to you to offer a whole burnt offering and peace-offerings: seven days shall you wait until I shall come to you, and I will make known to you what you shall do.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  009" id="10  009" >9</span>
 And it came to pass when he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   was turned with his shoulder.  </span>  turned his back to depart from Samuel, God  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   turned to him.  </span>  gave him another heart; and all these signs came to pass in that day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  010" id="10  010" >10</span>
 And he comes thence to the hill, and behold a band of prophets opposite to him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied in the midst of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  011" id="10  011" >11</span>
 And all that had known him before came, and saw, and behold, he   was   in the midst of the prophets: and the people said every one to his neighbor, What   is   this that has happened to the son of Kis?   is   Saul also among the prophets?  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  012" id="10  012" >12</span>

 And he ceased prophesying, and comes to the hill.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  014" id="10  014" >14</span>
 And his kinsman said to him and to his servant, Whither went you°? and they said, To seek the asses; and we saw that they were lost, and we went in to Samuel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  015" id="10  015" >15</span>
 And his kinsman said to Saul, Tell me, I pray you, What did Samuel say to you?  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  016" id="10  016" >16</span>
 And Saul said to his kinsman, he verily told me that the asses were found. But the matter of the kingdom he told him not.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  017" id="10  017" >17</span>
 And Samuel summoned all the people before the Lord to Massephath.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  018" id="10  018" >18</span>
 And he said to the children of Israel, Thus has the Lord God of Israel spoken, saying, I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, and I rescued you out of the hand of Pharao king of Egypt, and out of all the kingdoms that afflicted you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  019" id="10  019" >19</span>
 And you° have this day rejected God, who is himself your Deliverer out of all your evils and afflictions; and you° said, Nay, but you shall set a king over us: and now stand before the Lord according to your tribes, and according to your families.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  020" id="10  020" >20</span>
 And Samuel brought near all the tribes of Israel, and the tribe of Benjamin is taken by lot.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  021" id="10  021" >21</span>
 And he brings near the tribe of Benjamin by families, and the family of Mattari is taken by lot: and they bring near the family of Mattari, man by man, and Saul the son of Kis is taken; and he sought him, but he was not found.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  022" id="10  022" >22</span>
 And Samuel asked yet again of the Lord,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   does?.  </span>  Will the man come here? and the Lord said, Behold, he is hid among the stuff.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  023" id="10  023" >23</span>
 And he ran and took him thence, and he set him in the midst of the people; and he was higher than all the people by his shoulders and upwards.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  024" id="10  024" >24</span>
 And Samuel said to all the people, Have you° seen whom the Lord has chosen to himself, that there is none like to him among you all? And all the people took notice, and said, Let the king live!  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  025" id="10  025" >25</span>
 And Samuel told the people the manner of the king, and wrote it in a book, and set it before the Lord: and Samuel sent away all the people, and each went to his place.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  026" id="10  026" >26</span>
 And Saul departed to his house to Gabaa; and there went with Saul mighty men whose hearts God had touched.  <span class="verse" rel="v00910  027" id="10  027" >27</span>
 But evil men said, Who   is   this man   that   shall save us? and they despised him, and brought him no gifts.

 And the people said to Samuel, Who has said that Saul shall not reign over us? Give up the men, and we will put them to death.  <span class="verse" rel="v00911  013" id="11  013" >13</span>
 And Saul said, No man shall die this day, for today the Lord has wrought deliverance in Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00911  014" id="11  014" >14</span>
 And Samuel spoke to the people, saying, Let us go to Galgala, and there renew the kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v00911  015" id="11  015" >15</span>
 And all the people went to Galgala, and Samuel anointed Saul there to be king before the Lord in Galgala, and there he offered meat-offerings and peace-offerings before the Lord: and Samuel and all Israel rejoiced exceedingly.

<p><span class="chapter" id="12  001">12  </span> And Samuel said to all Israel, Behold, I have listened to your voice in all things that you° have said to me, and I have set a king over you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  002" id="12  002" >2</span>
 And now, behold, the king goes before you; and I am grown old and shall rest; and, behold, my sons   are   among you; and, behold, I have gone about before you from my youth to this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  003" id="12  003" >3</span>
 Behold,   here am   I, answer against me before the Lord and before his anointed: whose calf have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom of you have I oppressed? or from whose hand have I taken a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   propitiation.  </span>  bribe, even   to   a sandal? bear witness against me, and I will make restitution to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  004" id="12  004" >4</span>
 And they said to Samuel, You have not injured us, and you have not oppressed us; and you have not afflicted us, and you have not taken anything from any one's hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  005" id="12  005" >5</span>
 And Samuel said to the people, The Lord   is   witness among you, and his anointed   is   witness this day, that you° have not found anything in my hand: and they said,   He is   witness.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  006" id="12  006" >6</span>
 And Samuel spoke to the people, saying, The Lord who appointed Moses and Aaron   is   witness, who brought our fathers up out of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  007" id="12  007" >7</span>
 And now stand still, and I will judge you before the Lord; and I will relate to you all the righteousness of the Lord, the things which he has wrought among you and your fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  008" id="12  008" >8</span>
 When Jacob and his sons went into Egypt, and Egypt humbled them, then our fathers cried to the Lord, and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron; and they brought our fathers out of Egypt, and he made them to dwell in this place.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  009" id="12  009" >9</span>
 And they forgot the Lord their God, and he sold them into the hands of Sisara captain of the host of Jabis king of Asor, and into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the king of Moab; and he fought with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  010" id="12  010" >10</span>
 And they cried to the Lord, and said, We have sinned, for we have forsaken the Lord, and have served Baalim and the groves: and now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  011" id="12  011" >11</span>
 And he sent Jerobaal, and Barac, and Jephthae, and Samuel, and rescued us out of the hand of our enemies round about, and you° lived in security.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  012" id="12  012" >12</span>
 And you° saw that Naas king of the children of Ammon came against you, and you° said, Nay, none but a king shall reign over us; whereas the Lord our God   is   our king.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  013" id="12  013" >13</span>
 And now behold the king  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.+   'whom you° asked for,' nearer the   Heb.  </span>  whom you° have chosen; and behold, the Lord has set a king over you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  014" id="12  014" >14</span>
 If you° should fear the Lord, and serve him, and listen to his voice, and not resist the mouth of the Lord, and you° and your king that reigns over you should follow the Lord,   well  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  015" id="12  015" >15</span>
 But if you° should not listen to the voice of the Lord, and you° should resist the mouth of the Lord, then shall the hand of the Lord be upon you and upon your king.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  016" id="12  016" >16</span>
 And now stand still, and see this great thing, which the Lord will do before your eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  017" id="12  017" >17</span>
    Is it   not wheat harvest today? I will call upon the Lord, and he shall send thunder and rain; and know you° and see, that your wickedness   is   great which you° have wrought before the Lord, having asked for yourselves a king.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  018" id="12  018" >18</span>
 And Samuel called upon the Lord, and the Lord sent thunders and rain in that day; and all the people feared greatly the Lord and Samuel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  019" id="12  019" >19</span>
 And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for your servants to the Lord your God, and let us not die; for we have added to all our sins this iniquity, in asking for us a king.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  020" id="12  020" >20</span>
 And Samuel said to the people, Fear not: you° have   indeed   wrought all this iniquity; only turn not from following the Lord, and serve the Lord with all your heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  021" id="12  021" >21</span>
 And turn not aside after the   gods   that are nothing, who will do nothing, and will not deliver   you  , because they are nothing.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  022" id="12  022" >22</span>
 For the Lord will not cast off his people for his great name's sake, because the Lord graciously took you to himself for a people.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  023" id="12  023" >23</span>
 And far be it from me to sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you: but I will serve the Lord, and show you the good and the right way.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  024" id="12  024" >24</span>
 Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth and with all your heart, for you° see what great things he has wrought with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00912  025" id="12  025" >25</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="13  001">13  </span><span class="verse" rel="v00913  1-2" id="13  1-2" >1-2</span>
 And Saul chooses for himself three thousand men of the men of Israel: and there were with Saul two thousand who were in Machmas, and in mount Baethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gabaa of Benjamin: and he sent the rest of the people every man to his tent.  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  003" id="13  003" >3</span>
 And Jonathan struck Nasib the Philistine that lived in the hill; and the Philistines hear of it, and Saul sounds the trumpet through all the land, saying,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. העכיס as if העכריס.  </span>  The servants have despised   us  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  004" id="13  004" >4</span>
 And all Israel heard say, Saul has struck Nasib the Philistine; now Israel had been put to shame before the Philistines; and the children of Israel went up after Saul in Galgala.  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  005" id="13  005" >5</span>
 And the Philistines gather together to war with Israel; and then come up against Israel thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand by the seashore for multitude: and they come up, and encamp in Machmas, opposite Baethoron southward.  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  006" id="13  006" >6</span>
 And the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait so that they could not draw  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to battle.  </span>  near, and the people hid themselves in caves, and sheepfolds, and rocks, and ditches, and pits.  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  007" id="13  007" >7</span>
 And they that went over went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Galaad: and Saul was yet in Galgala, and all the people  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   was amazed.  </span>  followed after him in amazement.  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  008" id="13  008" >8</span>
 And he continued seven days for the appointed  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   set time.  </span>  testimony, as Samuel told him, and Samuel came not to Galgala, and his people were dispersed from him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  009" id="13  009" >9</span>
 And Saul said, Bring hither   victims  , that I may offer whole burnt offerings and peace-offerings: and he offered the whole burnt offering.  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  010" id="13  010" >10</span>
 And it came to pass when he had finished offering the whole burnt offering, that Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to meet him,   and   to bless him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  011" id="13  011" >11</span>
 And Samuel said, What have you done? and Saul said, Because I saw how the people were scattered from me, and you was not present as you purposed according to the set time of the days, and the Philistines were gathered to Machmas.  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  012" id="13  012" >12</span>
 Then I said, Now will the Philistines come down to me to Galgala, and I have not sought the face of the Lord: so I forced myself and offered the whole burnt offering.  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  013" id="13  013" >13</span>
 And Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly; for you have not kept my command, which the Lord commanded you, as now the Lord would have confirmed your kingdom over Israel for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  014" id="13  014" >14</span>
 But now your kingdom shall not stand to you, and the Lord shall seek for himself a man after his own heart; and the Lord shall appoint him to be a ruler over his people, because you have not kept all that the Lord commanded you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  015" id="13  015" >15</span>
 And Samuel arose, and departed from Galgala, and the remnant of the people went after Saul to meet   him   after the men of war, when they had come out of Galgala to Gabaa of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were found with him, about six hundred men.  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  016" id="13  016" >16</span>
 And Saul and Jonathan his son, and the people that were found with them, halted in Gabaa, of Benjamin; and they wept: and the Philistines had encamped in Machmas.  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  017" id="13  017" >17</span>
 And men came forth to destroy out of the land of the Philistines in three companies; one company turning by the way of Gophera toward the land of Sogal,  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  018" id="13  018" >18</span>
 and another company turning the way of Baethoron, and another company turning by the way of Gabae that turns aside to Gai of Sabim.  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  019" id="13  019" >19</span>
 And there was not found a smith in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make themselves sword or spear.  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  020" id="13  020" >20</span>
 And all Israel went down to the Land of the Philistines to forge every one his reaping-hook and his tool, and every one his axe and his sickle.  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  021" id="13  021" >21</span>
 And it was near the time of vintage: and their tools were   valued at   three shekels for a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   Such is the meaning of ὀδοὺς according to the old interpretors.  </span>  plowshare, and there was the same rate for the axe and the sickle.  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  022" id="13  022" >22</span>
 And it came to pass in the days of the war of Machmas, that there was not a sword or spear found in the hand of all the people, that were with Saul and Jonathan; but with Saul and Jonathan his son was there found.  <span class="verse" rel="v00913  023" id="13  023" >23</span>
 And there went out some from the camp of the Philistines to the place beyond Machmas.

<p><span class="chapter" id="14  001">14  </span> And when a certain day arrived, Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to Messab of the Philistines that is on the other side yonder; but he told not his father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  002" id="14  002" >2</span>
 And Saul sat on the top of the hill under the pomegranate tree that is in Magdon, and there were with him about six hundred men.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  003" id="14  003" >3</span>
 And Achia son of Achitob, the brother of Jochabed the son of Phinees, the son of Heli,   was   the priest of God in Selom wearing an ephod: and the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  004" id="14  004" >4</span>
 And in the midst of the passage whereby Jonathan sought to pass over to the encampment of the Philistines, there was both a sharp rock on this side, and a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   tooth of a rock.  </span>  sharp rock on the other side: the name of the one   was   Bases, and the name of the other Senna.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  005" id="14  005" >5</span>
 The one way   was   northward to one coming to Machmas, and the other way   was   southward to one coming to Gabae.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  006" id="14  006" >6</span>
 And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, let us go over to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. מצב 'garrison.'  </span>  Messab of these uncircumcised, if   perhaps   the Lord may do something for us; for the Lord is not straitened to save by many or by few.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  007" id="14  007" >7</span>
 And his armor-bearer said to him, Do all that your heart inclines toward: behold, I   am   with you, my heart   is   as your heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  008" id="14  008" >8</span>
 And Jonathan said, Behold, we  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   do go over.  </span>  will go over to the men, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   will be rolled down suddenly, etc.  </span>  will come down suddenly upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  009" id="14  009" >9</span>
 If they should say thus to us, Stand aloof there until we shall send you word; then we will stand still by ourselves, and will not go up against them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  010" id="14  010" >10</span>
    But   if they should say thus to us, Come up to us; then will we go up, for the Lord has delivered them into our hands; this   shall be   a sign to us.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  011" id="14  011" >11</span>
 And they both went in to Messab of the Philistines; and the Philistines  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   say.  </span>  said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of their Caves, where they had hidden themselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  012" id="14  012" >12</span>
 And the men of Messab answered Jonathan and his armor-bearer, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   say.  </span>  said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing: and Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, Come up after me, for the Lord has delivered them into the hands of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  013" id="14  013" >13</span>
 And Jonathan went up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer with him; and they looked on the face of Jonathan, and he struck them, and his armor-bearer did strike   them   after him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  014" id="14  014" >14</span>
 And the first  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   stroke.  </span>  slaughter which Jonathan and his armor-bearer effected was twenty men, with darts and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   casters of stones.  </span>  slings, and pebbles of the field.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  015" id="14  015" >15</span>
 And there was dismay in the camp, and in the field; and all the people in Messab, and the spoilers were amazed; and they would not act, and the land was terror-struck, and there was dismay from the lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  016" id="14  016" >16</span>
 And the watchmen of Saul [*]saw in Gabaa of Benjamin, and, behold, the army was thrown into confusion on every side.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  017" id="14  017" >17</span>
 And Saul said to the people with him, Number yourselves now, and see who has gone out from you: and they numbered themselves, and behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not found.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  018" id="14  018" >18</span>
 And Saul said to Achia, Bring the ephod; for he wore the ephod in that day before Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  019" id="14  019" >19</span>
 And it came to pass while Saul  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   is speaking.  </span>  was speaking to the priest, that the sound in the camp of the Philistines continued to increase greatly; and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw your hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  020" id="14  020" >20</span>
 And Saul went up and all the people that were with him, and they come to the battle: and, behold,   every   man's sword was against his neighbor, a very great confusion.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  021" id="14  021" >21</span>
 And the servants who had been  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   yesterday and the third day.  </span>  before with the Philistines, who had gone up to the army, turned themselves also to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  022" id="14  022" >22</span>
 And all the Israelites who were hidden in mount Ephraim heard also that the Philistines fled; and they also gather themselves after them to battle: and the Lord saved Israel in that day; and the war passed through Bamoth; and all the people with Saul were about ten thousand men.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  023" id="14  023" >23</span>
 And  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   the war was dispersed.  </span>  the battle extended itself to every city in the mount Ephraim.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  024" id="14  024" >24</span>
 And Saul committed a great trespass of ignorance in that day, and he lays a curse on the people, saying, Cursed   is   the man who shall eat bread before the evening; so I will avenge myself on my enemy: and none of the people tasted bread,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The true reading seems to be οὐκ ἠρίστα.   Tertullian   quotes 'et tota terra   non   prandebat.'  </span>  though all the land was dining.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  025" id="14  025" >25</span>
 And Jaal was a wood  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   of a swarm, etc.  </span>  abounding in swarms of bees on the face of the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  026" id="14  026" >26</span>
 And the people went into the place of the bees, and, behold,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. הלך רבש 'the honey ran.'  </span>  they continued speaking; and, behold, there was none that put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  027" id="14  027" >27</span>
 And Jonathan had not heard when his father adjured the people; and he reached forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, an dipped it into the honeycomb, and returned his hand to his mouth, and his eyes recovered their sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  028" id="14  028" >28</span>
 And one of the people answered and said, Your father solemnly adjured the people, saying, Cursed   is   the man who shall eat bread today. And the people were very faint,  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  029" id="14  029" >29</span>
 and Jonathan knew it, and said, My father has  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        E medio sustulit. עכר probably read as עבר.  </span>  destroyed the land: see how my eyes have received sight   now   that I have tasted a little of this honey.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  030" id="14  030" >30</span>
 Surely if the people had this day eaten freely of the spoils of their enemies which they found, the slaughter among the Philistines would have been greater.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  031" id="14  031" >31</span>
 And on that day he struck some of the Philistines in Machmas; and the people were very weary.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  032" id="14  032" >32</span>
 And the people turned to the spoil; and the people took flocks, and herds, and calves, and killed them on the ground, and the people ate with the blood.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  033" id="14  033" >33</span>
 And it was reported to Saul, saying, The people have sinned against the Lord, eating with the blood: and Saul said, Out of Getthaim roll a great stone to me hither.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  034" id="14  034" >34</span>
 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them to bring hither every one his calf, and every one his sheep: and let them kill it on this   stone   and sin not against the Lord in eating with the blood: and the people brought each one that which was in his hand, and they killed   them   there.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  035" id="14  035" >35</span>
 And Saul built an altar there to the Lord: this was the first altar that Saul built to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  036" id="14  036" >36</span>
 And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines this night, and let us plunder among them till the day break, and let us not leave a man among them. And they said, Do all that is good in your sight: and the priest said, let us draw near hither to God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  037" id="14  037" >37</span>
 And Saul enquired of God, If I go down after the Philistines, will you deliver them into the hands of Israel? And he answered him not in that day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  038" id="14  038" >38</span>
 And Saul said, Bring hither all the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   corners. See Zech. 10. 4.  </span>  chiefs of Israel, and know and see by whom this sin has been committed this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  039" id="14  039" >39</span>
 For as the Lord lives who has saved Israel,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   if he should answer or give sentence.  </span>  if answer should be against my son Jonathan, he shall surely die. And there was no one that answered out of all the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  040" id="14  040" >40</span>
 And he said to all the men of Israel, You° shall be under subjection, and I an Jonathan my son will be  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   become slaves, if proved guilty; but the LXX. might easily read לעבר as if לעבב.  </span>  under subjection: and the people said to Saul, Do that which is good in your sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  041" id="14  041" >41</span>
 And Saul said, O Lord God of Israel, why have you not answered your servant this day?   is   the iniquity in me, or in Jonathan my son? Lord God of Israel, give  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. חמיס   scil.   'that I or Jonathan are guilty, then let the people be considered guiltless.'  </span>  clear   manifestations  ; and if   the lot   should declare this, give, I pray you, to your people of Israel, give, I pray, holiness. And Jonathan and Saul are taken, and the people escaped.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  042" id="14  042" >42</span>
 And Saul said, Cast   lots   between me and my son Jonathan: whoever the Lord shall cause to be taken by lot, let him die: and the people said to Saul, This thing is not   to be done  : and Saul prevailed against the people, and they cast   lots   between him and Jonathan his son, and Jonathan is taken by lot.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  043" id="14  043" >43</span>
 And Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done: and Jonathan told him, and said, I did indeed taste a little honey, with the end of my staff that was in my hand, and, behold! I   am to   die.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  044" id="14  044" >44</span>
 And Saul said to him, God do so to me, and more also, you shall surely die today.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  045" id="14  045" >45</span>
 And the people said to Saul, Shall he that has wrought this great salvation in Israel be put to death this day?   As   the Lord lives, there shall not fall to the ground one of the hairs of his head; for the people of God have wrought successfully this day. And the people prayed for Jonathan in that day, and he died not.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  046" id="14  046" >46</span>
 And Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines departed to their place.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  047" id="14  047" >47</span>
 And Saul received the kingdom, by lot he inherits the office   of ruling   over Israel: and he fought against all his enemies round about, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against the children of Edom, and against Baethaeor, and against the king of Suba, and against the Philistines: wherever he turned, he was victorious.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  048" id="14  048" >48</span>
 And he wrought valiantly, and struck Amalec, and rescued Israel out of the hand of them that trampled on him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  049" id="14  049" >49</span>
 And the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Jessiu, and Melchisa: and   these were   the names of his two daughters, the name of the firstborn Merob, and the name of the second Melchol.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  050" id="14  050" >50</span>
 And the name of his wife was Achinoom, the daughter of Achimaa: and the name of his captain of the host was Abenner, the son of Ner, son of a kinsman of Saul.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  051" id="14  051" >51</span>
 And Kis   was   the father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abenezer,   was   son of Jamin, son of Abiel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00914  052" id="14  052" >52</span>
 And the war was vehement against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man, and any valiant man, then he took them to himself.

<p><span class="chapter" id="15  001">15  </span> And Samuel said to Saul, The Lord sent me to anoint you king over Israel: and now hear the voice of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  002" id="15  002" >2</span>
 Thus said the Lord of hosts, Now will I take vengeance for what Amalec did to Israel, when he met him in the way as he came up out of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  003" id="15  003" >3</span>
 And now go, and you shall strike Amalec and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See v 8.  </span>  Hierim and all that belongs to him, and you shall not save anything of him alive, but you shall utterly destroy him: and you shall devote him and all his to   destruction  , and you shall spare nothing belonging to him; and you shall kill both man and woman, and infant and suckling, and calf and sheep, and camel and ass.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  004" id="15  004" >4</span>
 And Saul summoned the people, and he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   numbers.  </span>  numbered them in Galgala, four hundred thousand  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   of ranks.  </span>  regular troops, and Juda thirty thousand regular troops.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  005" id="15  005" >5</span>
 And Saul came to the cities of Amalec, and laid wait in the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   brook.  </span>  valley.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  006" id="15  006" >6</span>
 And Saul said to the Kinite, Go, and depart out of the midst of the Amalekites, lest I put you with them; for you dealt mercifully with the children of Israel when they went up out of Egypt. So the Kinite departed from the midst of Amalec.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  007" id="15  007" >7</span>
 And Saul struck Amalec from Evilat to Sur fronting Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  008" id="15  008" >8</span>
 And he took Agag the king of Amalec alive, and he killed all the people and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        This is strangely given as the rendering of החריס 'he destroyed.'  </span>  Hierim with the edge of the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  009" id="15  009" >9</span>
 And Saul and all the people saved Agag alive, and the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   good.  </span>  best of the flocks, and of the herds, and of the fruits, of the vineyards, and of all the good things; and they would not destroy them: but every worthless and refuse  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   work.  </span>  thing they destroyed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  010" id="15  010" >10</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  011" id="15  011" >11</span>
 I have  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   'been comforted.' The word has been rendered the same way before.  </span>  repented that I have made Saul to be king: for he has turned back from following me, and has not kept my word. And Samuel was grieved, and cried to the Lord all night.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  012" id="15  012" >12</span>
 And Samuel rose early and went to meet Israel in the morning, and it was told  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. and   Alex.   Samuel.  </span>  Saul,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. and   Alex.   Saul.  </span>  saying, Samuel has come to Carmel, and he has  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   set up a hand.  </span>  raised up help for himself: and he turned his chariot, and came down to Galgala to Saul; and, behold, he was offering up a whole burnt offering to the Lord, the chief of the spoils which he brought out of Amalec.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  013" id="15  013" >13</span>
 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said to him, Blessed   are   you  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to the Lord.  </span>  of the Lord: I have  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   established.  </span>  performed all that the Lord said.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  014" id="15  014" >14</span>
 And Samuel said, What then   is   the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   voice.  </span>  bleating of this flock in my ears, and the sound of the oxen which I hear?  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  015" id="15  015" >15</span>
 And Saul said, I have brought them out of Amalec, that which the people preserved, even the best of the sheep, and of the cattle, that it might be sacrificed to the Lord your God, and the rest have I utterly destroyed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  016" id="15  016" >16</span>
 And Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell you what the Lord has said to me this night: and he said to him, Say on.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  017" id="15  017" >17</span>
 And Samuel said to Saul, Are you not little in his eyes,   though   a leader of  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   staff of a tribe. A double rendering of שבט   i.e.   both staff and tribe.  </span>  one of the tribes of Israel? and   yet   the Lord anointed you to be king over Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  018" id="15  018" >18</span>
 And the Lord sent you on a journey, and said to you, Go, and utterly destroy: you shall kill the sinners against me,   even   the Amalekites; and you shall war against them until you have consumed them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  019" id="15  019" >19</span>
 And why did not you listen to the voice of the Lord, but did haste to fasten upon the spoils, and did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  020" id="15  020" >20</span>
 And Saul said to Samuel, Because I listened to the voice of the people: yet I went the way by which the Lord sent me, and I brought Agag the king of Amalec, and I destroyed Amalec.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  021" id="15  021" >21</span>
 But the people took of the spoils the best flocks and herds   out   of that which was destroyed, to sacrifice before the Lord our God in Galgal.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  022" id="15  022" >22</span>
 And Samuel said, Does the Lord take pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in hearing the words of the Lord? behold, obedience   is   better than a good sacrifice, and hearkening than the fat of rams.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  023" id="15  023" >23</span>
 For sin is   as   divination; idols bring on pain and grief. Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord also shall reject you from being king over Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  024" id="15  024" >24</span>
 And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned, in that I have transgressed the word of the Lord and your direction; for I feared the people, and I listened to their voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  025" id="15  025" >25</span>
 And now remove, I pray you, my sin, and turn back with me, and I will worship the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  026" id="15  026" >26</span>
 And Samuel said to Saul, I will not turn back with you, for you have rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord will reject you from being king over Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  027" id="15  027" >27</span>
 And Samuel turned his face to depart, and Saul caught hold of the skirt of his  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   doublet, or mantle.  </span>  garment, and tore it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  028" id="15  028" >28</span>
 And Samuel said to him, The Lord has tore your kingdom from Israel out of your hand this day, and will give it to your neighbor who is better than you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  029" id="15  029" >29</span>
 And  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Wide variation from the   Heb.  </span>  Israel shall be divided to two: and   God   will not turn nor repent, for he is not as a man to repent.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  030" id="15  030" >30</span>
 And Saul said, I have sinned; yet honor me, I pray you, before the elders of Israel, and before my people; and turn back with me, and I will worship the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  031" id="15  031" >31</span>
 So Samuel turned back after Saul, and he worshipped the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  032" id="15  032" >32</span>
 And Samuel said, Bring me Agag the king of Amalec: and Agag came to him trembling; and Agag said  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   'If it be thus, bitter is death.'  </span> Is death thus bitter?  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  033" id="15  033" >33</span>
 And Samuel said to Agag, As your sword has bereaved women of their children, so shall your mother be made childless among women: and Samuel killed Agag before the Lord in Galgal.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  034" id="15  034" >34</span>
 And Samuel departed to Armathaim, and Saul went up to his house at Gabaa.  <span class="verse" rel="v00915  035" id="15  035" >35</span>
 And Samuel did not see Saul again till the day of his death, for Samuel mourned after Saul, and the Lord repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.  
<!-- 16   035 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="16  001">16  </span> And the Lord said to Samuel, How long do you mourn for Saul, whereas I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and come, I will send you to Jessae, to Bethleem; for I have seen among his sons a king for me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  002" id="16  002" >2</span>
 And Samuel said, How can I go? whereas Saul will hear of it, and kill me: and the Lord said, Take a heifer in your hand and you shall say, I am come to sacrifice to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  003" id="16  003" >3</span>
 And you shall call Jessae to the sacrifice, and I will make known to you what you shall do; and you shall anoint him whom I shall mention to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  004" id="16  004" >4</span>
 And Samuel did all that the Lord told him; and he came to Bethleem: and the elders of the city were amazed at meeting him, and said,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   is 'your coming in peace.'  </span>  Do you come peaceably, you Seer?  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  005" id="16  005" >5</span>
 And he said,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   peace.  </span>  Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice to the Lord. Sanctify yourselves, and rejoice with me this day: and he sanctified Jessae and his sons, and he called them to the sacrifice.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  006" id="16  006" >6</span>
 And it came to pass when they came in, that he saw Eliab, and said, Surely the Lord's anointed   is   before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  007" id="16  007" >7</span>
 But the Lord said to Samuel, Look not on his  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   face.  </span>  appearance, nor on his stature, for I have rejected him; for God  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   will not see.  </span>  sees not as man looks; for man looks at the outward appearance, but God looks at the heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  008" id="16  008" >8</span>
 And Jessae called Aminadab, and he passed before Samuel: and he said, Neither has God chosen this one.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  009" id="16  009" >9</span>
 And Jessae caused Sama to pass by: and he said, Neither has God chosen  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in this one.  </span>  this one.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  010" id="16  010" >10</span>
 And Jessae caused his seven sons to pass before Samuel: and Samuel said, the Lord has not chosen these.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  011" id="16  011" >11</span>
 And Samuel said to Jessae,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   Are your sons come to an end?  </span>  Hast you no more sons? And Jessae said,   There is   yet  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   the youngest.  </span>  a little one; behold, he tends the flock. And Samuel said to Jessae, Send and fetch him for we may not sit down till he comes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  012" id="16  012" >12</span>
 And he sent and fetched him: and he was ruddy, with beauty of eyes, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   goodly in the sight of the Lord.  </span>  very goodly to behold. And the Lord said to Samuel, Arise, and anoint David, for he is good.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  013" id="16  013" >13</span>
 And Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   leapt upon.  </span>  came upon David from that day forward: and Samuel arose, and departed to Armathaim.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  014" id="16  014" >14</span>
 And the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   choked him.  </span>  tormented him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  015" id="16  015" >15</span>
 And Saul's servants said to him, Behold now, and evil spirit from the Lord torments you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  016" id="16  016" >16</span>
 Let now your servants speak before you, and let them seek for our lord a man skilled to play on the harp; and it shall come to pass when an evil spirit comes upon you and he shall play on his harp, that you shall be well, and he shall refresh you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  017" id="16  017" >17</span>
 And Saul said to his servants, Look now out for me a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   man playing skilfully.  </span>  skillful player, and bring him to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  018" id="16  018" >18</span>
 And one of his servants answered and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jessae the Bethleemite, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   him understanding.  </span>  he understands playing   on the harp  , and the man   is   prudent, and a warrior, and wise in speech, and the man   is   handsome, and the Lord   is   with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  019" id="16  019" >19</span>
 And Saul sent messengers to Jessae, saying, Send to me your son David who is with your flock.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  020" id="16  020" >20</span>
 And Jessae took a homer of bread, and a bottle of wine, and one kid of the goats, and sent them by the hand of his son David to Saul.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  021" id="16  021" >21</span>
 And David went in to Saul, and stood before him; and he loved him greatly; and he became his armor-bearer.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  022" id="16  022" >22</span>
 And Saul sent to Jessae, saying, Let David, I pray you, stand before me, for he has found grace in my eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00916  023" id="16  023" >23</span>
 And it came to pass when the evil spirit was upon Saul, that David took his harp, and played with his hand: and Saul was refreshed, and   it was   well with him, and the evil spirit departed from him.

 And the Philistines stand on the mountain on one side, and Israel stands on the mountain on the other side, and the valley was between them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00917  004" id="17  004" >4</span>
 And there went forth a mighty man out of the army of the Philistines, Goliath, by name, out of Geth, his height   was   four cubits and a span.  <span class="verse" rel="v00917  005" id="17  005" >5</span>

 And greaves of grass   were   upon his legs, and a brazen target   was   between his shoulders.  <span class="verse" rel="v00917  007" id="17  007" >7</span>

    And Eliab his elder brother heard as he spoke to the men, and Eliab was very angry with David and said, Why have you thus come down, and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness?

 Your servant struck both the lion and the bear, and the uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them: shall I not go and strike him, and remove this day a reproach from Israel?

 The Lord who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this uncircumcised Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and the Lord shall be with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00917  038" id="17  038" >38</span>
 And Saul clothed David with a military coat, and   put   his brazen helmet on his head.  <span class="verse" rel="v00917  039" id="17  039" >39</span>

 And Jonathan called David, and told him all these words; and Jonathan brought David in to Saul, and he was before him as in former times.  <span class="verse" rel="v00919  008" id="19  008" >8</span>
 And  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   war added to be.  </span>  there was again war against Saul; and David did valiantly, and fought against the Philistines, and struck them with a very great slaughter, and they fled from before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00919  009" id="19  009" >9</span>
 And an evil spirit  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   of God.  </span>  from God was upon Saul, and he was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   sleeping.   Heb. sitting, perhaps ישך read for ישב.  </span>  resting in his house, and a spear   was   in his hand, and David was playing on the harp with his hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v00919  010" id="19  010" >10</span>
 And Saul sought  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to strike the spear into David.  </span>  to strike David with the spear; and David withdrew   suddenly   from the presence of Saul; and he drove the spear into the wall; and David retreated and escaped.  <span class="verse" rel="v00919  011" id="19  011" >11</span>
 And it came to pass in that night, that Saul sent messengers to the house of David to watch him, in order to kill him in the morning; and Melchol  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   his wife sent to David.  </span>  David's wife told him, saying, Unless you save your life this night, to-morrow you shall be slain.  <span class="verse" rel="v00919  012" id="19  012" >12</span>
 So Melchol lets David down by the window, and he departed, and fled, and escaped.  <span class="verse" rel="v00919  013" id="19  013" >13</span>
 And Melchol took  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. teraphim, probably such images as were put on monuments.  </span>  images, and laid them on the bed, and she put the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        כבר liver, has evidently been read here for כביר a quilt, or perhaps a pillow.  </span>  liver of a goat by his head, and covered them with clothes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00919  014" id="19  014" >14</span>
 And Saul sent messengers to take David; and they say that he is sick.  <span class="verse" rel="v00919  015" id="19  015" >15</span>
 And he sends to David, saying, Bring him to me on the bed, that I may kill him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00919  016" id="19  016" >16</span>
 And the messengers come, and, behold, the images   were   on the bed, and the goat's liver at his head.  <span class="verse" rel="v00919  017" id="19  017" >17</span>
 And Saul said to Melchol, Why have you thus deceived me, and suffered my enemy to depart, and he has escaped? and Melchol said to Saul, He said, let me go, and if not, I will kill you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00919  018" id="19  018" >18</span>
 So David fled, and escaped, and comes to Samuel to Armathaim, and tells him all that Saul had done to him: and Samuel and David went, and lived in Navath in Rama.  <span class="verse" rel="v00919  019" id="19  019" >19</span>
 And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David   is   in Navath in Rama.  <span class="verse" rel="v00919  020" id="19  020" >20</span>
 And Saul sent messengers to take David, and they saw the assembly of the prophets, and Samuel stood   as   appointed over them; and the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they prophesy.  <span class="verse" rel="v00919  021" id="19  021" >21</span>
 And it was told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied: and Saul sent again a third set of messengers, and they also prophesied.  <span class="verse" rel="v00919  022" id="19  022" >22</span>
 And Saul was very angry, and went himself also to Armathaim, and he comes as far as the well of the threshing floor that is in Sephi; and he asked and said, Where   are   Samuel and David? And they said, Behold, in Navath in Rama.  <span class="verse" rel="v00919  023" id="19  023" >23</span>
 And he went thence to Navath in Rama: and there came the Spirit of God upon him also, and he went on prophesying till he came to Navath in Rama.  <span class="verse" rel="v00919  024" id="19  024" >24</span>
 And he took off his clothes, and prophesied before them; and lay down naked all that day and all that night: therefore they said,   Is   Saul also among the prophets?

<p><span class="chapter" id="20  001">20  </span> And David fled from Navath in Rama, and comes into the presence of Jonathan; and he said, What have I done, and what   is   my fault, and wherein have I sinned before your father, that he seeks my life?  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  002" id="20  002" >2</span>
 And Jonathan said to him, Far be it from you: you shall not die: behold, my father will not do any thing great or small  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and will not uncover my ear.  </span>  without discovering it to me; and why should my father hide this matter from me? This thing is not   so  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  003" id="20  003" >3</span>
 And David answered Jonathan, and said, Your father knows surely that I have found grace in your sight, and he said, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he refuse his consent: but   as   the Lord lives and your soul lives, as I said,   the space   is filled up between me and death.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  004" id="20  004" >4</span>
 And Jonathan said to David, What does your soul desire, and what shall I do for you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  005" id="20  005" >5</span>
 And David said to Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow   is   the new moon, and I shall not on any account sit down to eat, but you shall let me go, and I will hide in the plain till the evening.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  006" id="20  006" >6</span>
 And if your father do in anyway  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   notice me as present or absent.  </span>  enquire for me, then shall you say, David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethleem his city, for   there is   there, a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   sacrifice of days.   Hebraism. </span>  yearly sacrifice for all the family.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  007" id="20  007" >7</span>
 If he shall say thus, Well, —  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   peace to your servant.  </span>    all is   safe for your servant: but if he shall answer harshly to you, know that evil is determined by him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  008" id="20  008" >8</span>
 And you shall deal mercifully with your servant; for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the Lord with yourself: and if there is iniquity in your servant, kill me yourself; but why do you thus bring me to your father?  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  009" id="20  009" >9</span>
 And Jonathan said, That be far from you: for if I surely know that evil is determined by my father to come upon you, although it should not be against your cities, I will tell you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  010" id="20  010" >10</span>
 And David said to Jonathan, Who can tell me if your father should answer roughly?  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  011" id="20  011" >11</span>
 And Jonathan said to David, Go, and abide in the field. And they went out both into the field.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  012" id="20  012" >12</span>
 And Jonathan said to David, the Lord God of Israel knows that I will sound my father as I have an opportunity,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. השליח the third day.  </span>  three several times, and, behold,   if good   should be determined concerning David, and I do not send to you to the field,  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  013" id="20  013" >13</span>
 God do so to Jonathan and more also: as I shall   also   report the evil to you, and make it known to you, and I will let you go; and you shall depart in peace, and the Lord shall be with you, as he was with my father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  014" id="20  014" >14</span>
 And if indeed  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   I yet being alive.  </span>  I continue to live, then shall you deal mercifully with me; and if I indeed die,  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  015" id="20  015" >15</span>
 you shall not withdraw your mercy from my house for ever: and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   The meaning of the   Heb. is here greatly obscured.  </span>  if you do not, when the Lord cuts off the enemies of David each from the face of the earth,  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  016" id="20  016" >16</span>
    should it happen   that the name of Jonathan be discovered by the house of David, then let the Lord seek out the enemies of David.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  017" id="20  017" >17</span>
 And Jonathan swore yet again to David, because he loved the soul of him that loved him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  018" id="20  018" >18</span>
 And Jonathan said, To-morrow   is   the new moon, and you will be enquired for, because your seat will be observed as vacant.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  019" id="20  019" >19</span>
 And you shall  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   act thrice.  </span>  stay three days, and watch an opportunity, and shall come to your place where you may hide yourself in the day of your business, and you shall wait by that  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        A corruption of the   Heb. ezel.  </span>  stone Ezel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  020" id="20  020" >20</span>
 And I will shoot  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   with.  </span>  three arrows, aiming them at  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The   Heb. has been turned into a proper name.  </span>  a mark.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  021" id="20  021" >21</span>
 And behold, I   will   send a lad, saying, Go find me the arrow.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  022" id="20  022" >22</span>
 If I should expressly say to the lad, The arrow   is   here, and on this side of you, take it;   then   come, for it is well with you, and there is no reason   for fear, as   the Lord lives:   but   if I should say thus to the young man, The arrow   is   on that side of you, and beyond; go, for the Lord has sent you away.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  023" id="20  023" >23</span>
 And as for the word which you and I have spoken, behold, the Lord   is   witness between me and you for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  024" id="20  024" >24</span>
 So David hides himself in the field, and the   new    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   moon.  </span>  month arrives, and the king comes to the table to eat.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  025" id="20  025" >25</span>
 And he sat upon his seat as  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   once and once.  </span>  in former times, even on his seat by the wall, and he went before Jonathan; and Abenner sat on one side of Saul, and the place of David was empty.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  026" id="20  026" >26</span>
 And Saul said nothing on that day, for he said, It seems to have fallen out that he is not clean, because he has not purified himself.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  027" id="20  027" >27</span>
 And it came to pass on the morrow, on the second day of the month, that the place of David was empty; and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why has not the son of Jessae attended both yesterday and today at the table?  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  028" id="20  028" >28</span>
 And Jonathan answered Saul, and said to him, David asked leave of me to go as far as Bethleem his city;  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  029" id="20  029" >29</span>
 and he said, Let me go, I pray you, for we have a family sacrifice in the city, and my brethren have  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   given a charge for me.  </span>  sent for me; and now, if I have found grace in your eyes, I will even go over and see my brethren: therefore he is not present at the table of the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  030" id="20  030" >30</span>
 And Saul was exceedingly angry with Jonathan, and said to him, You son of  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   deserting in a military sense.  </span>  traitorous damsels! for do I not know that you are an accomplice with the son of Jessae to your same, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  031" id="20  031" >31</span>
 For  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   all the days that.  </span>  so long as the son of Jessae lives upon the earth, your kingdom shall not be established: now then send and take the young man, for he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   is a son of death.  </span>  shall surely die.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  032" id="20  032" >32</span>
 And Jonathan answered Saul, Why  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   does he die.  </span>  is he to die? What has he done?  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  033" id="20  033" >33</span>
 And Saul lifted up his spear against Jonathan to kill him: so Jonathan knew that this evil was determined on by his father to kill David.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  034" id="20  034" >34</span>
 And Jonathan sprang up from the table in great anger, and did not eat bread on the second   day   of the month, for he grieved bitterly for David, because his father determined   on mischief   against him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  035" id="20  035" >35</span>
 And morning came, and Jonathan went out to the field, as he appointed   to do   for a signal to David, and a little boy   was   with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  036" id="20  036" >36</span>
 And he said to the boy, Run, find me the arrows which I shoot: and the boy ran, and   Jonathan   shot an arrow, and sent it beyond   him  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  037" id="20  037" >37</span>
 And the boy came to the place where the arrow was which Jonathan shot; and Jonathan cried out after the lad, and said, The arrow   is   on that side of you and beyond you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  038" id="20  038" >38</span>
 And Jonathan cried out after his boy, saying, Make all speed, and stay not. And Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows, and brought the arrows to his master.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  039" id="20  039" >39</span>
 And the boy knew nothing, only Jonathan and David   knew  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  040" id="20  040" >40</span>
 And Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to his boy, Go, enter into the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  041" id="20  041" >41</span>
 And when the lad went in, then David arose from the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   See v. 19.  </span>  south, and fell upon his face, and did obeisance to him three times, and they kissed each other, and wept for each other, for a great while.  <span class="verse" rel="v00920  042" id="20  042" >42</span>
 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, and as we have both sworn in the name of the Lord, saying, The Lord shall be witness between me and you, and between my seed and your seed for ever—  even so let it be  . And David arose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city.

<p><span class="chapter" id="21  001">21  </span> And David comes to Nomba to Abimelech the priest: and Abimelech was amazed at meeting him, and said to him, Why   are   you alone, and nobody with you?  <span class="verse" rel="v00921  002" id="21  002" >2</span>
 And David said to the priest, The king gave me a command today, and said to me, Let no one know the matter on which I send you, an concerning which I have charged you: and I have charged my servants   to be   in the place that is called,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        This is another instance of double translation, מקוצ suggesting probably both the idea of place and faithfulness.  </span>  The faithfulness of God,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Phellani maemoni,   a corruption of פלכי אלמבי.  </span>  Phellani Maemoni.  <span class="verse" rel="v00921  003" id="21  003" >3</span>
 And now if there are under your hand five loaves, give into my hand what is ready.  <span class="verse" rel="v00921  004" id="21  004" >4</span>
 And the priest answered David, and said, There are no common loaves under my hand, for I have none but holy loaves: if the young men have been kept at least from women, then they shall eat   them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00921  005" id="21  005" >5</span>
 And David answered the priest, and said to him, Yes, we have been kept from women for three days: when I came forth for the journey all the young men were purified; but this expedition is unclean, therefore it shall be sanctified this day because of my weapons.  <span class="verse" rel="v00921  006" id="21  006" >6</span>
 So Abimelech the priest gave him the show bread; for there were no loaves there, but only the presence loaves which had been removed from the presence of the Lord, in order that hot bread should be set on, on the day on which he took them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00921  007" id="21  007" >7</span>
 And there was there on that day one of Saul's servants  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The word Νεεσσαρὰν is another repitition.

 And David said to Abimelech, See if there is here under your hand spear or sword, for I have not  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   taken.  </span>  brought in my hand my sword or my weapons, for the word of the king was urgent.  <span class="verse" rel="v00921  009" id="21  009" >9</span>
 And the priest said, Behold the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck in the valley of Ela; and it is wrapt in a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.+   behind the ephod (or shoulder-piece) —so the   Heb.  </span>  cloth: if you will take it, take it for yourself, for there is no other except it here. And David said, Behold, there is none like it; give it me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00921  010" id="21  010" >10</span>
 And he gave it him; and David arose, and fled in that day from he presence of Saul: and David came to Anchus king of Geth.  <span class="verse" rel="v00921  011" id="21  011" >11</span>
 And the servants of Anchus said to him,   Is   not this David the king of the land? Did not the dancing women begin the son to him, saying, Saul has struck his thousand, and David his ten thousands?  <span class="verse" rel="v00921  012" id="21  012" >12</span>
 And David  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   put.  </span>  laid up the words in his heart, and was greatly afraid of Anchus king of Geth.  <span class="verse" rel="v00921  013" id="21  013" >13</span>
 And he changed his appearance before him, and feigned himself a false character in that day; and drummed upon the doors of the city, and used extravagant gestures with his hands, and fell against the doors of the gate, and his spittle ran down upon his beard.  <span class="verse" rel="v00921  014" id="21  014" >14</span>
 And Anchus said to his servants, Behold! you° see the man   is    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   or man epileptic.  </span>  mad: why have you° brought him in to me?  <span class="verse" rel="v00921  015" id="21  015" >15</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="22  001">22  </span> And David departed thence, and escaped; and he comes to the cave of Odollam, and his brethren hear, and the house of his father, and they go down to him there.  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  002" id="22  002" >2</span>
 And there gathered to him every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was troubled in mind; and he was a leader over them, and there were with him about four hundred men.  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  003" id="22  003" >3</span>
 And David departed thence to Massephath of Moab, and said to the king of Moab, Let, I pray you, my father and my mother be with you, until I know what God will do to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  004" id="22  004" >4</span>
 And he persuaded  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the face of the king.  </span>  the King of Moab, and they dwell with him continually, while David was in the hold.  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  005" id="22  005" >5</span>
 And Gad the prophet said to David, Dwell not in the hold: go, and you shall enter the land of Juda. So David went, and came and lived in the city of Saric.  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  006" id="22  006" >6</span>
 And Saul heard that David was discovered, and his men with him: now Saul lived in the hill below the field that is in Rama, and his spear   was   in his hand, and all his servants stood near him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  007" id="22  007" >7</span>
 And Saul said to his servants that stood by him, Hear now, you° sons of Benjamin, will the son of Jessae indeed give all of you fields and vineyards, and will he make you all captains of hundreds and captains of thousands?  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  008" id="22  008" >8</span>
 That you° are conspiring against me, and there is no one that informs me, whereas my son has made a covenant with the son of Jessae, and there is no one of you that  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   labors.  </span>  is sorry for me, or informs me, that my son has stirred up my servant against me for an enemy, as   it is   this day?  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  009" id="22  009" >9</span>
 And Doec the Syrian who was over the mules of Saul  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   answers.  </span>  answered and said, I saw the son of Jessae as he came to Nomba to Abimelech son of Achitob the priest.  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  010" id="22  010" >10</span>
 And   the priest   enquired of God for him, and gave him provision, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  011" id="22  011" >11</span>
 And the king sent to call Abimelech son of Achitob and all his father's sons, the priests that were in Nomba; and they all came to the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  012" id="22  012" >12</span>
 And Saul said, Hear now, you son of Achitob. And he said, Behold! I   am here  , speak,   my   lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  013" id="22  013" >13</span>
 And Saul said to him, Why have you and the son of Jessae conspired against me, that you should give him bread and a sword, and should enquire of God for him, to raise him up against me as an enemy, as   he is   this day?  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  014" id="22  014" >14</span>
 And he answered the king, and said, And who   is   there among all your servants faithful as David, and   he is   a son-in-law of the king, and   he is   executor of all your commands, and   is   honorable in your house?  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  015" id="22  015" >15</span>
 Have I begun today to enquire of God for him? By no means: let not the king bring a charge against his servant, and against you whole of my father's house; for your servant knew not in all these matters anything great or small.  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  016" id="22  016" >16</span>
 And king Saul said, You shall surely die, Abimelech, you, and all your father's house.  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  017" id="22  017" >17</span>
 And the king said to the footmen that attended on him, Draw near and kill the priests of the Lord, because their hand   is   with David, and because they knew that he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   flees.  </span>  fled, and they did not inform me. But the servants of the king would not lift their hands to fall upon the priest of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  018" id="22  018" >18</span>
 And the king said to Doec, Turn you, and fall upon the priests: and Doec the Syrian turned, and killed the priests of the Lord in that day, three hundred and five men, all wearing  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.   a linen ephod.  </span>  an ephod.  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  019" id="22  019" >19</span>
 And he struck Nomba the city of the priest with the edge of the sword, both man, and woman, infant and suckling, and calf, and ox, and sheep.  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  020" id="22  020" >20</span>
 And one son of Abimelech son of Achitob escapes, and his name   was   Abiathar, and he fled after David.  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  021" id="22  021" >21</span>
 And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain all the priests of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  022" id="22  022" >22</span>
 And David said to Abiathar, I knew it in that day, that Doec the Syrian would surely tell Saul: I am guilty of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   souls   or   lives.  </span>  death of the house of your father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00922  023" id="22  023" >23</span>
 Dwell with me; fear not, for wherever I shall seek a place   of safety   for my life, I will also seek a place for your life, for you are safely guarded   while   with me.

<p><span class="chapter" id="23  001">23  </span> And it was told David, saying, behold, the Philistines war in Keila, and they rob, they trample on the threshing-floors.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  002" id="23  002" >2</span>
 And David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go and strike these Philistines? And the Lord said, Go, and you shall strike these Philistines, and shall save Keila.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  003" id="23  003" >3</span>
 And the men of David said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judea; and how shall it be if we go to Keila? Shall we go after the spoils of the Philistines?  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  004" id="23  004" >4</span>
 And David enquired yet again of the Lord; and the Lord answered him, and said to him, Arise and go down to Keila, for I will deliver the Philistines into your hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  005" id="23  005" >5</span>
 So David and his men with him went to Keila, and fought with the Philistines; and they fled from before him, and he carried off their cattle, and struck them with a great slaughter, and David rescued the inhabitants of Keila.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  006" id="23  006" >6</span>
 And it came to pass when Abiathar the son of Achimelech fled to David, that he went down with David to Keila, having and ephod in his hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  007" id="23  007" >7</span>
 And it was told Saul that David was come to Keila: and Saul said, God has sold him into my hands, for he is shut up, having entered into a city that has gates and bars.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  008" id="23  008" >8</span>
 And Saul charged all the people to go down to war to Keila, to besiege David and his men.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  009" id="23  009" >9</span>
 And David knew that Saul  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   is not silent concerning.  </span>  spoke openly of mischief against him: and David said to Abiathar the priest, Bring the ephod of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  010" id="23  010" >10</span>
 And David said, Lord God of Israel, your servant has indeed heard, that Saul seeks to come against Keila to destroy the city on my account.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  011" id="23  011" >11</span>
 Will   the place    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        i.e.   besieged.  </span>  be shut up? And now will Saul come down, as your  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Verse 12 is here supplied by   Alex. </span>  servant has heard? Lord God of Israel, tell your servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  012" id="23  012" >12</span>
 And the Lord said, It will be shut up.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  013" id="23  013" >13</span>
 And David arose, and the men with him, in number about four hundred, and they went forth from Keila, and went wherever they could go: and it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keila, and he forbore to come.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  014" id="23  014" >14</span>
 And he lived in Maserem in the wilderness, in the narrow   passes  ; and lived in the wilderness in mount Ziph, in the dry country. And Saul sought him continually, but the Lord delivered him not into his hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  015" id="23  015" >15</span>
 And David perceived that Saul went forth to seek David; and David was in the dry mountain in the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The Hebrew הוש has here been read as if חוש  </span>  New Ziph.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  016" id="23  016" >16</span>
 And Jonathan son of Saul rose, and went to David to Caene, and strengthened his hands in the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  017" id="23  017" >17</span>
 And he said to him, Fear not, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you; and you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be second to you; and Saul my father knows it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  018" id="23  018" >18</span>
 So they both made a covenant before the Lord; and David lived in Caene, and Jonathan went to his home.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  019" id="23  019" >19</span>
 And the Ziphites came up out of the dry country to Saul to the hill, saying, Behold, is not David hidden with us in Messara, in the narrows in Caene in the hill of Echela, which is on the right of Jessaemon?  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  020" id="23  020" >20</span>
 And now   according to   all the king's desire to come down, let him come down to us; they have shut him up into the hands of the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  021" id="23  021" >21</span>
 And Saul said to them, Blessed   be   you° of the Lord, for you° have been grieved on my account.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  022" id="23  022" >22</span>
 Go, I pray you, and make preparations yet, and notice his place where his foot shall be, quickly, in that place which you° spoke of, lest by any means he should deal craftily.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  023" id="23  023" >23</span>
 Take notice, then, and learn, and I will go with you; and it shall come to pass that if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  024" id="23  024" >24</span>
 And the Ziphites arose, and went before Saul: and David and his men   were   in the wilderness of Maon, westward, to the right of Jessaemon.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  025" id="23  025" >25</span>
 And Saul and his men went to seek him: and they brought word to David, and he went down to the rock that was in the wilderness of Maon: and Saul heard, and followed after David to the wilderness of Maon.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  026" id="23  026" >26</span>
 And Saul and his men go on one side of the mountain, and David and his men are on the other side of the mountain: and David was hiding himself to escape from Saul: and Saul and his men encamped against David and his men, in order to take them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  027" id="23  027" >27</span>
 And there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste you, and come here, for the Philistines have invaded the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00923  028" id="23  028" >28</span>
 So Saul returned from following after David, and went to meet the Philistines: therefore that place was called The divided Rock.  
<!-- 24   028 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="24  001">24  </span> And David rose up from thence, and lived in the narrow passes of Engaddi.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  002" id="24  002" >2</span>
 And it came to pass when Saul returned from pursuing after the Philistines, that it was reported to him, saying, David   is   in the wilderness of Engaddi.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  003" id="24  003" >3</span>
 And he took with him three thousand men, chosen out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men in front of Saddaeem.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  004" id="24  004" >4</span>
 And he came to the flocks of sheep that were by the way, and there was a cave there; and Saul went in to make preparation, and David and his men were sitting in the inner part of the cave.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  005" id="24  005" >5</span>
 And the men of David said to him, Behold, this   is   the day of which the Lord spoke to you, that he would deliver your enemy into your hands; and you shall do to him as   it is   good in your sight. So David arose and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   took away.  </span>  cut off the skirt of Saul's garment secretly.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  006" id="24  006" >6</span>
 And it came to pass after this that David's heart struck him, because he had cut off the skirt of his garment.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  007" id="24  007" >7</span>
 And David said to his men, The Lord forbid it me, that I should do this ting to my lord the anointed of the Lord, to lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  008" id="24  008" >8</span>
 So David persuaded his men by   his   words, and did not suffer them to arise and kill Saul: and Saul arose and went his way.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  009" id="24  009" >9</span>
 And David rose up   and went   after him out of the cave: and David cried after Saul, saying,   My   lord,   O   king! and Saul looked behind him, and David  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   stooped.  </span>  bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  010" id="24  010" >10</span>
 And David said to Saul, Why do you listen to the words of the people, saying, Behold, David seeks your life?  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  011" id="24  011" >11</span>
 Behold, your eyes have seen this day how that the Lord has delivered you this day into my hands in the cave; and I would not kill you, but spared you, and said, I will not lift up my hand against my lord, for he is the Lord's anointed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  012" id="24  012" >12</span>
 And behold, the skirt of your mantle   is   in my hand, I cut off the skirt, and did not kill you: know then and see today, there is no evil in my hand, nor impiety, nor rebellion; and I have not sinned against you, yet you  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   bindest my soul.  </span>  lay snares for my soul to take it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  013" id="24  013" >13</span>
 The Lord judge between me and you, and the Lord requite you on yourself: but my hand shall not be upon you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  014" id="24  014" >14</span>
 As the old proverb  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   is said.  </span>  says, Transgression will proceed from the wicked ones: but my hand shall not be upon you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  015" id="24  015" >15</span>
 And now after whom do you come forth, O king of Israel? After whom do you pursue? After a dead dog, and after a flea?  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  016" id="24  016" >16</span>
 The Lord be judge and umpire between me and you, the Lord look upon and judge my cause, and rescue me out of your hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  017" id="24  017" >17</span>
 And it came to pass when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said,   Is   this your voice, Son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  018" id="24  018" >18</span>
 And Saul said to David, You   are   more righteous that I, for you have recompensed me good, but I have recompensed you evil.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  019" id="24  019" >19</span>
 And you have told me today what good you have done me, how the Lord shut me up into your hands today, and you did not kill me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  020" id="24  020" >20</span>
 And if any one should find his enemy in distress, and should send him forth in a good way, then the Lord will reward him good, as you have done this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  021" id="24  021" >21</span>
 And now, behold, I know that you shall surely reign, and the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  022" id="24  022" >22</span>
 Now then swear to me by the Lord, that you will not destroy my seed after me, that you will not blot out my name from the house of my father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00924  023" id="24  023" >23</span>
 So David swore to Saul: and Saul departed to his place, and David and his men went up to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   narrow Messera.  </span>  the strong-hold of Messera.

Paran.  </span>  Maon.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  002" id="25  002" >2</span>
 And there was a man in Maon, and his flocks were in Carmel, and   he was   a very great man; and he had  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   3,000 flocks; as we say in English, 3,000 troops, meaning men formed into troops.  </span>  three thousand sheep, and a thousand she-goats: and he happened to be shearing his flock in Carmel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  003" id="25  003" >3</span>
 And the man's name   was   Nabal, and his wife's name   was   Abigaia: and his wife   was   of good understanding and very beautiful in person: but the man   was   harsh, and evil in his doings, and the man   was   churlish.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  004" id="25  004" >4</span>
 And David heard in the wilderness, that Nabal the Carmelite was shearing his sheep.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  005" id="25  005" >5</span>
 And David sent ten young men, and he said to the young men, Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and ask him in my name how  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   concerning peace.  </span>  he is.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  006" id="25  006" >6</span>
 And thus shall you° say, May you and your house seasonably prosper, and all your be  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in health.  </span>  in prosperity.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  007" id="25  007" >7</span>
 And now, behold, I have heard that your shepherds who were with is in the wilderness are shearing  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   for you.  </span>  your sheep, and we hindered them not, neither did we demand any thing from them all the time they were in Carmel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  008" id="25  008" >8</span>
 Ask your servants, and they will tell you. Let then your servants find grace in your eyes, for we are come on a good day; give we pray you, whatever your hand may find, to your son David.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  009" id="25  009" >9</span>
 So the servants come and speak these words to Nabal, according to all these words in the name of David.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  010" id="25  010" >10</span>
 And Nabal sprang up, and answered the servants of David, and said, Who   is   David? and who   is   the son of Jessae? Now-a-days there is abundance of servants who depart every one from his master.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  011" id="25  011" >11</span>
 And shall I take my bread, and my wine, and my  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   slaying.  </span>  beasts that I have slain for  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   them that shear my sheep.  </span>  my shearers, and shall I give them to men of whom I know not whence they are?  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  012" id="25  012" >12</span>
 So the servants of David turned  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to their way.  </span>  back, and returned, and came and reported to David according to these words.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  013" id="25  013" >13</span>
 And David said to his men, Gird on every man his sword.  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.   and   Heb.+ 'and they girded on every man his sword, and David also girded on his sword.'  </span>  And they went up after David, about four hundred men: and two hundred abode with the stuff.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  014" id="25  014" >14</span>
 And one of the servants reported to Abigaia the wife of Nabal, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our lord; but he turned away from them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  015" id="25  015" >15</span>
 And the men were very good to us; they did not hinder us, neither did they demand from us any thing all the days that we were with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  016" id="25  016" >16</span>
 And when we were in the field, they were as a wall round about us, both by night and by day, all the days that we were with them feeding the flock.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  017" id="25  017" >17</span>
 And now do you consider, and see what you will do; for mischief is determined against our lord and against his house; and he   is   a vile character, and one can’t speak to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  018" id="25  018" >18</span>
 And Abigaia hasted, and took two hundred loaves, and two vessels of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five ephahs of fine flour, and one homer of dried grapes, and two hundred cakes of figs, and put them upon asses.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  019" id="25  019" >19</span>
 And she said to her servants, Go on before me, and behold I come after you: but she told not her husband.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  020" id="25  020" >20</span>
 And it came to pass when she had mounted her ass and was going down by the covert of the mountain, behold, David and his men came down to meet her, and she met them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  021" id="25  021" >21</span>
 And David said, Perhaps I have kept all his possessions in the wilderness that he should wrong me, and we did not order the taking anything of all his goods; yet he has rewarded me evil for good.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  022" id="25  022" >22</span>
 So God do to David and more also, if I leave one male of all that belong to Nabal until the morning.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  023" id="25  023" >23</span>
 And Abigaia saw David, and she hasted and alighted from her ass; and she felt before David on her face, and did obeisance to him,   bowing   to the ground  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  024" id="25  024" >24</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. and   Alex.+   and she fell.  </span>    even   to his feet, and said, On me, my lord, be my wrong: let, I pray you, your servant speak in your ears, and hear you the words of your servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  025" id="25  025" >25</span>
 Let not my lord, I pray you, take to heart this pestilent man,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. and   Alex.+      'even    Nabal'  </span>  for according to his name, so is he; Nabal   is   his name, and folly   is   with him: but I your handmaid saw not the servants of my lord whom you did send.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  026" id="25  026" >26</span>
 And now, my lord,   as   the Lord lives, and your soul lives, as the Lord has kept you from coming against innocent blood, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   saving your hand for yourself.  </span>  from executing vengeance for yourself, now therefore let your enemies, and those that seek evil against my lord, become as Nabal.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  027" id="25  027" >27</span>
 And now accept this  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   blessing.  </span>  token of goodwill, which your servant has brought to my lord, and you shall give it to the servants that wait on my lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  028" id="25  028" >28</span>
 Remove, I pray you, the trespass of your servant; for the Lord will surely make for my lord a sure house, for the Lord fights the battles of my lord, and there shall no evil be ever found in you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  029" id="25  029" >29</span>
 And   if   a man shall rise up persecuting you and seeking your life, yet shall the life of my lord be bound up in the bundle of life with the Lord God, and you shall whirl the life of your enemies   as   in the midst of a sling.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  030" id="25  030" >30</span>
 And it shall be when the Lord shall have wrought for my lord all the good things he has spoken concerning you, and shall appoint you to be ruler over Israel;  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  031" id="25  031" >31</span>
 then this shall not be an abomination and offense to my lord, to have shed innocent blood without cause, and for my lord to have avenged himself: and so may the Lord do good to my lord, and you shall remember your handmaid to do her good.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  032" id="25  032" >32</span>
 And David said to Abigaia, Blessed   be   the Lord God of Israel, who sent you this very day to meet me:  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  033" id="25  033" >33</span>
 and blessed   be   your conduct, and blessed   be   you, who have hindered me this very day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  034" id="25  034" >34</span>
 But surely as the Lord God of Israel lives, who hindered me this day from doing you harm, if you had not hasted and come to meet me, then I said, There shall   surely   not be left to Nabal till the morning one male.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  035" id="25  035" >35</span>
 And David took of her hand all that she brought to him, and said to her, Go in peace to your house: see, I have listened to your voice, and accepted your  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   face.  </span>  petition.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  036" id="25  036" >36</span>
 And Abigaia came to Nabal: and, behold, he had a banquet in this house, as the banquet of a king, and the heart of Nabal   was   merry  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   upon him.  </span>  within him, and he   was   very drunken: and she told him nothing great or small till the morning light.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  037" id="25  037" >37</span>
 And it came to pass in the morning, when Nabal recovered from his wine, his wife told him these words; and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  038" id="25  038" >38</span>
 And  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   there were about ten days, etc.  </span>  it came to pass after about ten days, that the Lord struck Nabal, and he died.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  039" id="25  039" >39</span>
 And David heard it  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. and   Alex.   insert 'that Nabal was dead.  </span>  and said, Blessed   be   the Lord, who has judged the cause of my reproach at the hand of Nabal, and has delivered his servant  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   from the hand of wicked men.  </span>  from the power of evil; and the Lord has returned the mischief of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and spoke concerning Abigaia, to take her to himself for a wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  040" id="25  040" >40</span>
 So the servants of David came to Abigaia to Carmel, and spoke to her, saying, David has sent us to you, to take you to himself for a wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  041" id="25  041" >41</span>
 And she arose, and did reverence with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, your servant   is   for an handmaid to wash the feet of your servants.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  042" id="25  042" >42</span>
 And Abigaia arose, and mounted her ass, and five damsels followed her: and she went after the servants of David, and became his wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  043" id="25  043" >43</span>
 And David took Achinaam out of Jezrael, and they were both his wives.  <span class="verse" rel="v00925  044" id="25  044" >44</span>
 And Saul gave Melchol his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. and   Alex.

<p><span class="chapter" id="26  001">26  </span> And the Ziphites come out of the dry country to Saul to the hill, saying, Behold, David hides himself with us in the hill Echela, opposite Jessemon.  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  002" id="26  002" >2</span>
 And Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, and with him   went   three thousand men chosen out of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  003" id="26  003" >3</span>
 And Saul encamped in the hill of Echela in front of Jessemon, by the way, and David lived in the wilderness: and David saw that Saul  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   comes.  </span>  came after him into the wilderness.  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  004" id="26  004" >4</span>
 And David sent spies, and ascertained that Saul was come prepared out of Keila.  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  005" id="26  005" >5</span>
 And David arose secretly, and goes into the place where Saul was sleeping, and there   was   Abenner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul was sleeping in a chariot, and the people had encamped along round about him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  006" id="26  006" >6</span>
 And David answered and spoke to Abimelech the Chettite, and to Abessa the son Saruia the brother of Joab, saying, Who will go in with me to Saul into the camp? And Abessa said, I will go in with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  007" id="26  007" >7</span>
 So David and Abessa go in among the people by night: and behold, Saul was fast asleep in the chariot, and his spear was stuck in the ground near his head, and Abenner and his people slept round about him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  008" id="26  008" >8</span>
 And Abessa said to David, The Lord has this day shut up your enemy into your hands, and now I will  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   double   the stroke    to him.  </span>  strike him to the earth with the spear to the ground once   for all  , and I will not strike him again.  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  009" id="26  009" >9</span>
 And David said to Abessa, Do not lay him low, for who shall lift up his hand against the anointed of the Lord, and be guiltless?  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  010" id="26  010" >10</span>
 And David said,   As   the Lord lives, if the Lord strike him not, or his day come and he die, or he go down to battle and be added   to his fathers, do not so  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  011" id="26  011" >11</span>
 The Lord forbid it me that I should lift up my hand against the anointed of the Lord: and now take, I pray you, the spear from his bolster, and the pitcher of water, and let us return  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   καθ᾿ ἑαυτούς.   q.d.   chez nous.  </span>  home.  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  012" id="26  012" >12</span>
 So David took the spear, and the pitcher of water from his bolster, and they went home: and there was no one that saw, and no one that knew, and there was no one that awoke, all being asleep, for a stupor from the Lord had fallen upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  013" id="26  013" >13</span>
 So David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off, and   there was   a good distance between them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  014" id="26  014" >14</span>
 And David called to the people, and spoke to Abenner, saying, Will you not answer, Abenner? and Abenner answered and said, Who are you that call?  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb.+ to the king.   Alex.   'me to the king.'  </span>   <span class="verse" rel="v00926  015" id="26  015" >15</span>
 And David said to Abenner,   Are   not you a man? and who   is   like you in Israel? Why then do you not guard your lord the king? for one out of the people went in to destroy your lord the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  016" id="26  016" >16</span>
 And this thing   is   not good which you have done.   As   the Lord lives, you° are  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   sons of slaughter.  </span>  worthy of death, you° who guard your lord the king, the anointed of the Lord: and now behold, I pray you, the spear of the king, and the cruse of water: where are the articles that should be at his head?  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  017" id="26  017" >17</span>
 And Saul recognized the voice of David, and said,   Is   this your voice, son David? and David said, I   am   your servant,   my   lord, O king.  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  018" id="26  018" >18</span>
 And he said, Why does my lord thus pursue after his servant? for in what have I sinned? and what unrighteousness has been found in me?  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  019" id="26  019" >19</span>
 And now let my lord the king hear the word of his servant. If God stirs you up against me, let your offering be acceptable: but if the sons of men, they   are   cursed before the Lord, for they have cast me out this day so that I should not be established in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go, serve other Gods.  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  020" id="26  020" >20</span>
 And now let not my blood fall to the ground before  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the face of the Lord.  </span>  the Lord, for the king of Israel has come forth to seek your life, as the night hawk pursues   its prey   in the mountains.  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  021" id="26  021" >21</span>
 And Saul said, I have sinned: turn, son David, for I will not hurt you, because my life was precious in your eyes; and today I have been foolish and have erred exceedingly.  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  022" id="26  022" >22</span>
 And David answered and said, Behold, the spear of the king: let one of the servants come over and take it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  023" id="26  023" >23</span>
 And the Lord shall recompense each according to his righteousness and his truth, since the Lord delivered you this day into my hands, and I would not lift my hand against the Lord's anointed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  024" id="26  024" >24</span>
 And, behold, as your life has been  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   magnified.  </span>  precious this very day in my eyes, so let my life be  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   magnified.  </span>  precious before the Lord, and may he protect me, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   shall deliver.  </span>  deliver me out of all affliction.  <span class="verse" rel="v00926  025" id="26  025" >25</span>
 And Saul said to David, Blessed   be   you,   my   son; and you shall surely do valiantly, and surely prevail. And David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.  
<!-- 27   025 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="27  001">27  </span> And David said in his heart, Now shall I be one day delivered   for death   into the hands of Saul; and there is no good thing for me unless I should escape into the land of the Philistines, and Saul should cease from seeking me  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   into.  </span>  through every coast of Israel: so I shall escape out of his hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v00927  002" id="27  002" >2</span>
 So David arose, and the six hundred men that were with him, and he went to Anchus, son Ammach, king of Geth.  <span class="verse" rel="v00927  003" id="27  003" >3</span>
 And David lived with Anchus, he and his men, each with his family; and David and both his wives, Achinaam, the Jezraelitess, and Abigaia the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.  <span class="verse" rel="v00927  004" id="27  004" >4</span>
 And it was told Saul that David had fled to Geth; and he no longer sought after him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00927  005" id="27  005" >5</span>
 And David said to Anchus, If now your servant has found grace in your eyes, let them give me, I pray you, a place in one of the cities in the country, and I will dwell there: for why does your servant dwell with you in a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   city reigned over.  </span>  royal city?  <span class="verse" rel="v00927  006" id="27  006" >6</span>
 And he gave him Sekelac in that day: therefore Sekelac came into possession of the king of Judea to this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00927  007" id="27  007" >7</span>
 And the number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was four months.  <span class="verse" rel="v00927  008" id="27  008" >8</span>
 And David and his men went up, and made an attack on all the Gesirites and on the Amalekites: and behold, the land was inhabited, (even the land  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Th LXX have rendered מעולס ... שוה   of old to Shur,   by ἀπὸ Γελαμψοὺρ.  </span>  from Gelampsur) by those who come from the fortified   cities   even to the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00927  009" id="27  009" >9</span>
 And he struck the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive; and they took flocks, and herds, and asses, and camels, and raiment; and they returned and came to Anchus.  <span class="verse" rel="v00927  010" id="27  010" >10</span>
 And Anchus said to David, On whom have you° made an attack today? And David said to Anchus, On the south of Judea, and on the south of Jesmega, and on the south of the Kenezite.  <span class="verse" rel="v00927  011" id="27  011" >11</span>
 And I have not saved man or woman alive to bring them to Geth, saying, Lest they carry a report to Geth against us, saying, These things David does. And this was his manner all the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" rel="v00927  012" id="27  012" >12</span>
 So David had the full confidence of Anchus,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   saying.  </span>  who said, He is thoroughly disgraced among his people in Israel and he shall be my servant for ever.  
<!-- 28   012 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="28  001">28  </span> And it came to pass in those days that the Philistines gathered themselves together with their armies to go out to fight with Israel; and Anchus said to David,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   you shall know surely.  </span>  Know surely, that you shall go forth to battle with me,   you  , and your men.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  002" id="28  002" >2</span>
 And David said to Anchus, Thus now you shall know what your servant will do. And Anchus said to David, So will I make you captain of my body-guard continually.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  003" id="28  003" >3</span>
 And Samuel died, and all Israel lamented for him, and they bury him in his city, in Armathaim. And Saul had removed those who had in them divining spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  004" id="28  004" >4</span>
 And the Philistines assemble themselves, and come and encamp in Sonam: and Saul gathers all the men of Israel, and they encamp in Gelbue.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  005" id="28  005" >5</span>
 And Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, and he was alarmed, and his heart was greatly dismayed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  006" id="28  006" >6</span>
 And Saul enquired of the Lord; and the Lord answered him not by dreams, nor by manifestations, nor by prophets.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  007" id="28  007" >7</span>
 Then Saul said to his servants, Seek for me a woman who has in her a divining spirit, and I will go to her, and enquire of her: and his servants said to him, Behold,   there is   a woman who has in her a divining spirit at Aendor.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  008" id="28  008" >8</span>
 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he goes, and two men with him, and they come to the woman by night; and he said to her, Divine to me, I pray you, by the divining spirit within you, and bring up to me him whom I shall name to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  009" id="28  009" >9</span>
 And the woman said to him, Behold now, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   ventriloquists.  </span>  those who had in them divining spirits, and the wizards from the land, and why do you spread a snare for my life to destroy it?  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  010" id="28  010" >10</span>
 And Saul swore to her, and said,   As   the Lord lives,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   if injury.  </span>  no injury shall come upon you on this account.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  011" id="28  011" >11</span>
 And the woman said, Whom shall I bring up to you? and he said, Bring up to me Samuel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  012" id="28  012" >12</span>
 And the woman saw Samuel, and cried out with a loud voice: and the woman said to Saul, Why have you deceived me? for you are Saul.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  013" id="28  013" >13</span>
 And the king said to her, Fear not; tell me whom you have seen. And the woman said to him, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  014" id="28  014" >14</span>
 And he said to her, What did you perceive? and she said to him, An upright man ascending out of the earth, and he   was   clothed with a mantle. And Saul knew that this was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the earth, and did obeisance to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  015" id="28  015" >15</span>
 And Samuel said, Why have you troubled me, that I should come up? And Saul said, I am greatly distressed, and the Philistines war against me, and God has departed from me, and no longer  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   has listened.  </span>  hearkens to me either by the hand of the prophets or by dreams: and now I have called you to tell me what I shall do.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  016" id="28  016" >16</span>
 And Samuel said, Why asked you me, whereas the Lord has departed from you, and taken part with your neighbor?  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  017" id="28  017" >17</span>
 And the Lord has done to you, as the Lord spoke by  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   my hand.  </span>  me; and the Lord will rend your kingdom out of your hand, and will give it to your neighbor David.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  018" id="28  018" >18</span>
 because you did not listen to the voice of the Lord, and did not execute his fierce anger upon Amalec, therefore the Lord has done this thing to you this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  019" id="28  019" >19</span>
 And the Lord shall deliver Israel with you into the hands of the Philistines, and to-morrow you and your sons with you shall fall, and the Lord shall deliver the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  020" id="28  020" >20</span>
 And Saul  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   hasted and fell standing or at his full length; as the   Hebrew. </span>  instantly fell at his full length upon the earth, and was greatly afraid because of the words of Samuel; and there was no longer any strength in him, for he had  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   ate.  </span>  eaten no bread all that day, and all that night.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  021" id="28  021" >21</span>
 And the woman went in to Saul, and saw that he was greatly  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   hasted.   q.d.   trepidavit.  </span>  disquieted, and said to him, Behold now, your handmaid has listened to your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        i.e.   obeyed.  </span>  heard the words which you have spoken to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  022" id="28  022" >22</span>
 And now listen, I pray you, to the voice of your handmaid, and I will set before you a morsel of bread, and eat, and you shall be strengthened, for you will be going on your way.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  023" id="28  023" >23</span>
 But he would not eat; so his servants and the woman constrained him, and he listened to their voice, and rose up from the earth, and sat upon a bench.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  024" id="28  024" >24</span>
 And the woman had a fat heifer in the house; and she hasted and killed it; and she took meal and kneaded it, and baked unleavened cakes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00928  025" id="28  025" >25</span>
 And she brought   the meat   before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate, and rose up, and departed that night.

<p><span class="chapter" id="29  001">29  </span> And the Philistines gather all their armies to Aphec, and Israel encamped in Aendor, which is in Jezrael.  <span class="verse" rel="v00929  002" id="29  002" >2</span>
 And the lords of the Philistines went on  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to   or   at.  </span>  by hundreds and thousands, and David and his men went on in the rear with Anchus.  <span class="verse" rel="v00929  003" id="29  003" >3</span>
 And the lords of the Philistines said, Who   are   these  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The word עכר is here translated; as in Gen. xiv 13.  </span>  that pass by? And Anchus said to the captains of the Philistines,   Is   not this David the servant of Saul king of Israel? He has been with us  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to   or   days.  </span>  some time, even this second year, and I have not found any fault in him from the day that he attached himself to me even until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00929  004" id="29  004" >4</span>
 And the captains of the Philistines were displeased at him, and they say to him, Send the man away, and let him return to his place, where you did set him; and let him not come with us to the war, and let him not be a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   to   or   a plotter against the camp.  </span>  traitor in the camp: and wherewith will he be reconciled to his master? Will it not be with the heads of those men?  <span class="verse" rel="v00929  005" id="29  005" >5</span>
    Is   not this David whom they  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to   or   began to   celebrate   or gave the precedence.  </span>  celebrated in dances, saying, Saul has struck his thousands, and David his ten thousands?  <span class="verse" rel="v00929  006" id="29  006" >6</span>
 And Anchus called David, and said to him,   As   the Lord lives, you   are   right and approved in my eyes, and   so is   your going out and your coming in with me in the army, and I have not found   any   evil to charge against you from the day that you came to me until this day: but you are not approved in the eyes of the lords.  <span class="verse" rel="v00929  007" id="29  007" >7</span>
 Now then return and go in peace, thus you shall not do evil in the sight of the lords of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" rel="v00929  008" id="29  008" >8</span>
 And David said to Anchus, What have I done to you? and what have you found in your servant from the   first   day that I was before you even until this day, that I should not come  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to   or   warring, or having warred.  </span>  and war against the enemies of the lord my king?  <span class="verse" rel="v00929  009" id="29  009" >9</span>
 And Anchus answered David, I know that you   are   good in my eyes,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. and   Alex.+   an angel of God.  </span>  but the lords of the Philistines say, He shall not come with us to the war.  <span class="verse" rel="v00929  010" id="29  010" >10</span>
 Now then rise up early in the morning, you and the servants of your lord that are come with you, and go to the place where I appointed you, and entertain no evil thought in your heart, for you   are   good in my sight: and rise early for your journey  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and let there be light upon you.  </span>  when it is light, and depart.  <span class="verse" rel="v00929  011" id="29  011" >11</span>
 So David arose early, he and his men, to depart and guard the land of the Philistines: and the Philistines went up to Jezrael to battle.

<p><span class="chapter" id="30  001">30  </span> And it came to pass when David and his men had entered Sekelac on the third day, that Amalec had made an incursion upon the south, and upon Sekelac, and struck Sekelac, and burnt it with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  002" id="30  002" >2</span>
 And as to the women and all things that were in it, great and small, they killed neither man nor woman, but carried them captives, and went on their way.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  003" id="30  003" >3</span>
 And David and his men came into the city, and, behold, it was burnt with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters were carried captive.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  004" id="30  004" >4</span>
 And David and his men lifted up their voice, and wept till there was no longer any power within them to weep.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  005" id="30  005" >5</span>
 And both the wives of David were carried captive, Achinaam, the Jezraelitess, and Abigaia the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  006" id="30  006" >6</span>
 And David was greatly distressed, because the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, each for his sons and his daughters: but David strengthened himself in the Lord his God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  007" id="30  007" >7</span>
 And David said to Abiathar the priest the son of Achimelech, Bring near the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.   and   Heb.+ 'And Abiathar brought the ephod to David.'  </span>  ephod.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  008" id="30  008" >8</span>
 And David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I pursue after this  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The Greek is borrowed from the Hebrew.  </span>  troop? shall I overtake them? and he said to him, Pursue, for you shall surely overtake them, and you shall surely rescue   the captives  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  009" id="30  009" >9</span>
 So David went, he an the six hundred men with him, an they come as far as the brook Bosor, and the superfluous ones stopped.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  010" id="30  010" >10</span>
 And he pursued them with four hundred men; and there remained behind two hundred men, who tarried on the other side of the brook Bosor.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  011" id="30  011" >11</span>
 And they find an Egyptian in the field, and they take him, and bring him to David; and they  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   give.  </span>  gave him bread and he ate, and they caused him to drink water.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  012" id="30  012" >12</span>
 And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and he ate, and his spirit was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   staid   or   established in him.  </span>  restored in him; for he had not eaten bread, and had not drunk water three days and three nights.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  013" id="30  013" >13</span>
 And David said to him, Whose are you? and whence are you? and the young man the Egyptian said, I am the servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me, because I was taken ill three days ago.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  014" id="30  014" >14</span>
 And we made an incursion on the south of the Chelethite, and on the parts of Judea, and on the south of Chelub, and we burnt Sekelac with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  015" id="30  015" >15</span>
 And David said to him, Will you bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear now to me by God, that you will not kill me, and that you will not deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down upon this troop.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  016" id="30  016" >16</span>
 So be brought him down there, and behold, they   were   scattered abroad upon the surface of the whole land, eating and drinking, and feasting by   reason of   all the great spoils which they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  017" id="30  017" >17</span>
 And David came upon them, and struck them from the morning till the evening, and on the next day; and not one of them escaped, except four hundred young men, who were mounted on camels, and fled.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  018" id="30  018" >18</span>
 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and he rescued both his wives.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  019" id="30  019" >19</span>
 And  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See Num 31. 49. Josh 23. 14. 3 Kings 8. 56.  </span>  nothing was lacking to them of great or small, either of the spoils, or the sons and daughters, or anything that they had taken of theirs; and David recovered all.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  020" id="30  020" >20</span>
 And he took all the flocks, and the herds, and led them away before the spoils: and it was said of these spoils, These   are   the spoils of David.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  021" id="30  021" >21</span>
 And David comes to the two hundred men who were left behind that they should not follow after David, and he had caused them to remain  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in.  </span>  by the brook of Bosor; and they came forth to meet David, and to meet his people with him: and David drew near to the people, and they asked him how he did.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  022" id="30  022" >22</span>
 Then every ill-disposed and bad man of the soldiers who had gone with David, answered and said, Because they did not pursue together with us, we will not give them of the spoils which we have recovered, only let each one lead away with him his wife and his children, and let them return.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  023" id="30  023" >23</span>
 And David said, You° shall not do so, after the Lord has delivered   the enemy   to us, and guarded us, and the Lord has delivered into our hands the troop that came against u.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  024" id="30  024" >24</span>
 And who will listen to these your words? for they are not  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   an inferior thing.  </span> inferior to us; for according to the portion of him that went down to the battle, so shall be the portion of him that abides with the baggage; they shall share alike.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  025" id="30  025" >25</span>
 And it came to pass from that day forward, that it became an ordinance and a custom in Israel until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  026" id="30  026" >26</span>
 And David came to Sekelac, and sent of the spoils to the elders of Juda, and to his friends, saying,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. and   Alex.   'Behold! a blessing from you.' etc.  </span>  Behold   some   of the spoils of the enemies of the Lord;  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  027" id="30  027" >27</span>

 And to those in Aroer, and to those in Ammadi, and to those in Saphi, and to those in Esthie,  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  029" id="30  029" >29</span>
 and to those in Geth, and to those in Cimath, and to those in Saphec, and to those in Themath, and to those in Carmel, and to those in the cities of Jeremeel, and to those in the cities of the Kenezite;  <span class="verse" rel="v00930  030" id="30  030" >30</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="31  001">31  </span> And the Philistines fought with Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and they fall down wounded in the mountain in Gelbue.  <span class="verse" rel="v00931  002" id="31  002" >2</span>
 And the Philistines press closely on Saul and his sons, and the Philistines strike Jonathan, and Aminadab, and Melchisa son of Saul.  <span class="verse" rel="v00931  003" id="31  003" >3</span>
 And the battle prevails against Saul, and the shooters with arrows, even the archers find him, and he was wounded  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   in the hypochondria.  </span>  under the ribs.  <span class="verse" rel="v00931  004" id="31  004" >4</span>
 And Saul said to his armor-bearer, Draw your sword and pierce me through with it; lest these uncircumcised come and pierce me through, and mock me. But his armor-bearer would not, for he feared greatly: so Saul took his sword and fell upon it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00931  005" id="31  005" >5</span>
 And his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, and he fell also himself upon his sword, and died with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00931  006" id="31  006" >6</span>
 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor-bearer, in that day together.  <span class="verse" rel="v00931  007" id="31  007" >7</span>
 And the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those beyond Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead; and they leave their cities and flee: and the Philistines come and dwell in them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00931  008" id="31  008" >8</span>
 And it came to pass on the morrow that the Philistines come to strip the dead, and they find Saul and his three sons fallen on the mountains of Gelbue.  <span class="verse" rel="v00931  009" id="31  009" >9</span>
