<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the eighth month, in the second year of   the reign of   Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zacharias, the son of Barachias, the son of Addo, the prophet, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 The Lord has been very angry with your fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 And you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord Almighty: Turn to me, says the Lord of hosts, and I will turn to you, says the Lord of hosts.  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And be you° not as your fathers, whom the prophets before charged, saying, Thus says the Lord Almighty: Turn you° from your evil ways, and from your evil practices: but they listened not, and attended not to listen to me, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 Where are your fathers, and the prophets? Will they live for ever?  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 But do you° receive my words and my ordinances, all that I command by my Spirit to my servants the prophets, who lived in the days of your fathers; and they answered and said, As the Lord Almighty determined to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our practices, so has he done to us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 On the twenty-fourth   day   in the eleventh month, this is the month Sabat, in the second year of   the reign of   Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zacharias, the son of Barachias, the son of Addo, the prophet, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 I saw by night, and behold a man mounted on a red horse, and he stood between the shady mountains; and behind him were red horses, and grey, and piebald, and white.  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 And I said, What are these,   my   lord? And the angel spoke with me said to me, I will show you what these   things   are.  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 And the man that stood between the mountains answered, and said to me, These are   they   whom the Lord has sent forth to go round the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 And they answered the angel of the Lord that stood between the mountains, and said, We have gone round all the earth, and, behold, all the earth is inhabited, and is at rest.  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 Then the angel of the Lord answered and said, O Lord Almighty, how long will you have no mercy on Jerusalem, and the cities of Juda, which you have disregarded  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   this seventies year.  </span>  these seventy years?  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 And the Lord Almighty answered the angel that spoke with me good words and consolatory sayings.  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 And the angel that spoke with me said to me, Cry out and say, Thus says the Lord Almighty; I have been jealous for Jerusalem and Sion with great jealousy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 And I am very angry with the heathen that combine to attack   her  : forasmuch as I indeed was a little angry, but they combined to attack   her   for evil.  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord: I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; and my house shall be rebuilt in her, says the Lord Almighty, and a measuring line shall yet be stretched out over Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 And the angel that spoke with me said to me, Cry yet, and say, Thus says the Lord Almighty; Yet shall cities be spread abroad through prosperity; and the Lord shall yet have mercy upon Sion, and shall choose Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 And I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold four horns.  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 And I said to the angel that spoke with me, What are these things,   my   lord? And he said to me, These are the horns that have scattered Juda, and Israel, and Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 And the Lord showed me four artificers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0381  021" id="1  021" >21</span>
 And I said, What are these coming to do? And he said, These are the horns that scattered Juda, and they broke Israel in pieces, and none of them lifted up his head: and these are come forth to sharpen them for their hands,   even   the four horns, the nations that lifted up the horn against the land of the Lord to scatter it.  
<!-- 2   021 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> And I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a man, and in his hand a measuring line.  <span class="verse" rel="v0382  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 And I said to him, Whither go you? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth of it, and what is the length of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0382  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 And, behold, the angel that spoke with me stood   by  , and another angel went forth to meet him,  <span class="verse" rel="v0382  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 and spoke to him, saying, Run and speak to that young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be fully inhabited by reason of the abundance of men and cattle in the midst of her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0382  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 And I will be to her, says the Lord, a wall of fire round about, and I will be for a glory in the midst of her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0382  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, says the Lord: for I will gather you from the four winds of heaven, says the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v0382  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
    even   to Sion: deliver yourselves, you° that dwell   with   the daughter of Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0382  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 For thus says the Lord Almighty; After the glory has he sent me to the nations that spoiled you: for he that touches you is as one that touches the apple of his eye.  <span class="verse" rel="v0382  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 For, behold, I bring my hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to them that serve them: and you° shall know that the Lord Almighty has sent me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0382  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Sion: for, behold, I come, and will dwell in the midst of you, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0382  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 And many nations shall flee for refuge to the Lord in that day, and they shall be for a people to him, and they shall dwell in the midst of you: and you shall know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0382  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 And the Lord shall inherit Juda his portion in the holy   land  , and he will yet choose Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0382  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 Let all flesh fear before the Lord: for he has risen up from his holy clouds.

<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> And the Lord showed me Jesus the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   accuser.  </span>  Devil stood on his right hand to resist him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0383  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 And the Lords said to the Devil,  <span class="verse" rel="v0383  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
   <span class="xrefmarker">*</span><span class="xref">        Jude 9.  </span>  The Lord rebuke you, O Devil, even the Lord that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: behold! is not this as a brand plucked from the fire?  <span class="verse" rel="v0383  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 Now Jesus was clothed in  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   vile, see James 2. 2.  </span>  filthy raiment, and stood before the angel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0383  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 And   the Lord   answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy raiment from him: and he said to him, Behold, I have taken away your iniquities: and clothe you° him with a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   full length.  </span>  long robe,  <span class="verse" rel="v0383  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 and place a pure mitre upon his head. So they placed a pure mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments: and the angel of the Lord stood   by  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0383  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 And the angel of the Lord testified to Jesus, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0383  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 Thus says the Lord Almighty; If you will walk in my ways, and take heed to my charges, then shall you judge my house: and if you will diligently keep my court, then will I give you men to walk in the midst of these that stand   here  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0383  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 Hear now, Jesus the high priest, you, and your neighbors that are sitting before   you  : for they are diviners, for, behold, I bring forth my servant The  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See Luke 1. 78.  </span>  Branch.  <span class="verse" rel="v0383  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 For   as for   the stone which I have set before the face of Jesus, on the one stone are seven eyes: behold, I am digging a trench, says the Lord Almighty, and I will search out all the iniquity of that land in one day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0383  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 In that day, says the Lord Almighty, you° shall call together every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.

<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> And the angel that talked with me returned, and awakened me, as when a man is awakened out of his sleep.  <span class="verse" rel="v0384  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 And he said to me, What see you? And I said, I have seen, and behold a candlestick all of gold, and its bowl upon it, and seven lamps upon it, and seven oil funnels to the lamps upon it:  <span class="verse" rel="v0384  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 and two olive-trees above it, one on the right of the bowl, and one on the left.  <span class="verse" rel="v0384  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 And I inquired, and spoke to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these things,   my   lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v0384  005" id="4  005" >5</span>
 And the angel that talked with me answered, and spoke to me, saying, Know you not what these things are? And I said, No,   my   lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0384  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 And he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the Lord to Zorobabel, saying, Not by mighty power, nor by strength, but by my Spirit, says the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0384  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 Who are you, the great mountain before Zorobabel, that you should prosper? whereas I will bring out the stone of the inheritance, the grace of it the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   equality, see Jno. 1. 16.  </span>  equal of   my    grace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0384  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0384  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 The hands of Zorobabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands shall finish it: and you shall know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0384  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 For who has despised the small days? surely they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet of tin in the hand of Zorobabel: these are the seven eyes  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.   + 'of the Lord.'  </span>  that look upon all the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0384  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 And I answered, and said to him, What are these two olive-trees, which are on the right and left hand of the candlestick?  <span class="verse" rel="v0384  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 And I asked the second time, and said to him, What are the two branches of the olive-trees that are by the side of the two golden  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   nostrils.  </span>  pipes that pour into and communicate with the golden oil funnels?  <span class="verse" rel="v0384  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 And he said to me, Know you not what these are? and I said, No,   my   lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0384  014" id="4  014" >14</span>
 And he said, These are the two  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   sons of fatness. Rev. 11. 4.  </span>  anointed ones   that   stand by the Lord of the whole earth.

<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> And I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked and behold a flying sickle.  <span class="verse" rel="v0385  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 And he said to me, What see you? And I said, I see a flying sickle, of the length of twenty cubits, and of the breadth of ten cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v0385  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 And he said to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth: for every thief shall be punished with death on this side, and every false swearer shall be punished on that side.  <span class="verse" rel="v0385  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 And I will bring it forth, says the Lord Almighty, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that swears falsely by my name: and it shall rest in the midst of his house, and shall consume it, and the timber of it, and the stones of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0385  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 And the angel that talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up your eyes, and see this that goes forth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0385  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the measure that goes forth. And he said, This is their iniquity in all the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0385  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 And behold a talent of lead lifted up: and behold  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb.   and   Gr.   one woman. see ver. 9.  </span>  a woman sat in the midst of the measure.  <span class="verse" rel="v0385  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 And he said, This is iniquity. And he cast it into the midst of the measure, and cast the weight of lead on the mouth of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0385  009" id="5  009" >9</span>

 In the first chariot   were   red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;  <span class="verse" rel="v0386  003" id="6  003" >3</span>

    As for the chariot   in which were the black horses, they went out to the land of the north; and the white went out after them; and the piebald went out to the land of the south.  <span class="verse" rel="v0386  007" id="6  007" >7</span>

 And you shall take silver and gold, and make crowns, and you shall put   them   upon the head of Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest;  <span class="verse" rel="v0386  012" id="6  012" >12</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="7  001">7  </span> And it came to pass in the fourth year of Darius the king,   that   the word of the Lord came to Zacharias on the fourth   day   of the ninth month, which is Chaseleu.  <span class="verse" rel="v0387  002" id="7  002" >2</span>
 And Sarasar and Arbeseer the king and his men sent to Bethel, and   that   to propitiate the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v0387  003" id="7  003" >3</span>
 speaking to the priests that were in the house of the Lord Almighty, and to the prophets, saying, The holy offering has come in hither in the fifth month, as it has done already many years.  <span class="verse" rel="v0387  004" id="7  004" >4</span>
 And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0387  005" id="7  005" >5</span>
 Speak to the whole people of the land, and to the priests, saying, Though you° fasted or lamented in the fifth or seventh   months   (yes, behold, these seventy years) have you° at all fasted to me?  <span class="verse" rel="v0387  006" id="7  006" >6</span>
 And if you° eat or drink, do you° not eat and drink for yourselves?  <span class="verse" rel="v0387  007" id="7  007" >7</span>

 And the word of the Lord came to Zacharias, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0387  009" id="7  009" >9</span>
 Thus says the Lord Almighty; Judge righteous judgment, and deal mercifully and compassionately every one with his brother:  <span class="verse" rel="v0387  010" id="7  010" >10</span>

 But they refused to attend, and madly turned their back, and made their ears heavy, so that they should not hear.  <span class="verse" rel="v0387  012" id="7  012" >12</span>
 And they made their heart disobedient, so as not to listen to my law, and the words which the Lord Almighty sent forth by his Spirit by the former prophets: so there was great wrath from the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0387  013" id="7  013" >13</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> And the word of the Lord Almighty came, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0388  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 Thus says the Lord Almighty; I have been jealous for Jerusalem and for Sion with great jealousy, and I have been jealous for her with great fury.  <span class="verse" rel="v0388  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 Thus says the Lord; I will return to Sion, and dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a true city, and the mountain of the Lord Almighty a holy mountain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0388  004" id="8  004" >4</span>
 Thus says the Lord Almighty; There shall yet dwell old men and old women in the streets of Jerusalem, every one holding his staff in his hand for age.  <span class="verse" rel="v0388  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 And the broad places of the city shall be filled with boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.  <span class="verse" rel="v0388  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 Thus says the Lord Almighty; If it shall be impossible in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, shall it also be impossible in my sight? says the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0388  007" id="8  007" >7</span>
 Thus says the Lord Almighty; Behold, I   will   save my people from the east country, and the west country;  <span class="verse" rel="v0388  008" id="8  008" >8</span>
 and I will bring them in, and cause   them   to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be to me a people, and I will be to them a God, in truth and in righteousness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0388  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 Thus says the Lord Almighty; Let your hands be strong,   you° that   hear in these days these words out of the mouth of the prophets, from the day that the house of the Lord Almighty was founded, and from the time that the temple was built.  <span class="verse" rel="v0388  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 For before those days the wages of men could not be profitable, and there could be no hire of cattle, and there could be no peace by reason of the affliction to him that went out or to him that came in: for I would have let loose all men, every one against his neighbor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0388  011" id="8  011" >11</span>
 But now I   will   not do to the remnant of this people according to the former days, says the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0388  012" id="8  012" >12</span>
 But I will show peace: the vine shall yield her fruit, and the land shall yield her produce, and the heaven shall give its dew: and I will give as an inheritance all these things to the remnant of my people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0388  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 And it shall come to pass, as you° were a curse among the nations, O house of Juda, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and you° shall be a blessing: be of good courage, and strengthen your hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v0388  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 For thus says the Lord Almighty; As I took counsel to afflict you when your fathers provoked me, says the Lord Almighty, and I repented not:  <span class="verse" rel="v0388  015" id="8  015" >15</span>

 and let none of you devise evil in his heart against his neighbor; and love not a false oath: for all these things I hate, says the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0388  018" id="8  018" >18</span>
 And the word of the Lord Almighty came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0388  019" id="8  019" >19</span>
 Thus says the Lord Almighty, The fourth fast, and the fifth fast, and the seventh fast, and the tenth fast, shall be to the house of Juda for joy and gladness, and for good feasts; and you° shall rejoice; and love you° the truth and peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0388  020" id="8  020" >20</span>
 Thus says the Lord Almighty; Yet shall many peoples come, and the inhabitants of many cities;  <span class="verse" rel="v0388  021" id="8  021" >21</span>
 and the inhabitants of five cities shall come together to one city, saying, Let us go to make supplication to the Lord, and to seek the face of the Lord Almighty; I will go also.  <span class="verse" rel="v0388  022" id="8  022" >22</span>

 Thus says the Lord Almighty; In those days   my word shall be fulfilled   if ten men of all the languages of the nations should take hold—even take hold of the hem of a Jew, saying, We will go with you; for we have heard that God is with you.

 And the Lord said to me, Take yet to you shepherd's implements belonging to an unskillful shepherd.  <span class="verse" rel="v03811  016" id="11  016" >16</span>
 For, behold, I   will   raise up a shepherd against the land: he shall not visit that which is perishing, and he shall not seek that which is scattered, and he shall not heal that which is bruised, nor guide that which is whole: but he shall devour the flesh of the choice   ones  , and shall  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   wring their necks.  </span>  dislocate the joints   of their necks  .  <span class="verse" rel="v03811  017" id="11  017" >17</span>

 Behold, I   will   make Jerusalem as trembling  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   porches   or,   door-posts shaken by, etc.  </span>  door-posts to all the nations round about, and in Judea there shall be a siege against Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v03812  003" id="12  003" >3</span>

 In that day, says the Lord Almighty, I will strike every horse with amazement, and his rider with madness: but I will open my eyes upon the house of Juda, and I will strike all the horses of the nations with blindness.  <span class="verse" rel="v03812  005" id="12  005" >5</span>

 In that day I will make the captains of thousands of Juda as a firebrand among wood, and as a torch of fire in stubble; and they shall devour on the right hand and on the left all the nations round about: and Jerusalem shall dwell again by herself,   even   in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v03812  007" id="12  007" >7</span>

 And it shall come to pass in that day,   that   the Lord shall defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and the weak one among them in that day shall be as David, and the house of David as the house of God, as the angel of the Lord before them.  <span class="verse" rel="v03812  009" id="12  009" >9</span>

 And it shall come to pass, if a man will yet prophesy, that his father and his mother which gave birth to him shall say to him, You shall not live; for you have spoken lies in the name of the Lord: and his father and his mother who gave him birth shall bind him as he is prophesying.  <span class="verse" rel="v03813  004" id="13  004" >4</span>

 And I will gather all the Gentiles to Jerusalem to war, and the city shall be taken, and the houses plundered, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, but the rest of my people shall not be utterly cut off from the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v03814  003" id="14  003" >3</span>
 And the Lord shall go forth, and fight with those Gentiles as when he fought in the day of war.  <span class="verse" rel="v03814  004" id="14  004" >4</span>
 And his feet shall stand in that day on the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave asunder, half of it toward the east and the west, a very great division; and half the mountain shall lean to the north, and half of it to the south.  <span class="verse" rel="v03814  005" id="14  005" >5</span>
 And the valley of my mountains shall be closed up, and the valley of the mountains shall be joined on to Jasod, and shall be blocked up as it was blocked up in the days of the earthquake, in the days of Ozias king of Juda; and the Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v03814  006" id="14  006" >6</span>
