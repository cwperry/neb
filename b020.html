<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Proverbs of Solomon son of David, who reigned in Israel;  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 to know wisdom and instruction, and to perceive words of understanding;  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 to receive also  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. turnings, q.d. knotty words. See Heb.  </span>  hard saying, and to understand true justice, and   how   to direct judgment;  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 that he might give subtlety to the simple, and to the young man  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, discretion.  </span>  discernment and understanding.  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 For by the hearing of these a wise man will be wiser, and man of understanding will gain direction;  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 and will understand a parable, and a dark speech; the saying of the wise also, and riddles.  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 The fear of the Lord is the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, sum, or, top.  </span>  beginning of wisdom; and   there is   good understanding to all that practise it: and piety toward God is the beginning of discernment; but the ungodly will set at nothing wisdom and instruction.  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 Hear,   my   son, the instruction of your father, and reject not the rules of your mother.  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 For you shall receive for your head a crown of graces, and a chain of gold round your neck.  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
    My   son, let not ungodly men lead you astray, neither consent you   to them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 If they should exhort you, saying, Come with us, partake in blood, and let us unjustly hide the just man in the earth:  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 and let us swallow him alive, as Hades   would  , and remove the memorial of him from the earth:  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 let us seize on his valuable property, and let us fill our houses with spoils:  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 but do you cast in your lot with us, and let us all provide a common purse, and let us have one pouch:  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 go not in the way with them, but turn aside your foot from their paths:  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        For ver16, see Appendix  </span>   <span class="verse" rel="v0201  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        this verse is not in the text. The Alexandrine text is shown here  </span>    For their feet run to do evil, and are swift to shed blood.     <span class="verse" rel="v0201  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 for nets are not without cause spread for birds.  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 For they that are concerned in murder store up evils for themselves; and the overthrow of transgressors is evil.  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 These are the ways of all that perform lawless deeds; for by ungodliness they destroy their own life.  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 Wisdom sings aloud in passages, and in the broad places speaks boldly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  021" id="1  021" >21</span>
 And she makes proclamation on the top of the walls, and sits by the gates of princes; and at the gates of the city boldly says,  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  022" id="1  022" >22</span>
 So long as the simple cleave to justice, they shall not be ashamed: but the foolish being lovers of haughtiness, having become ungodly have hated knowledge, and are become subject to reproofs.  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  023" id="1  023" >23</span>
 Behold, I will bring forth to you the utterance of my breath, and I will instruct you in my speech.  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  024" id="1  024" >24</span>
 Since I called, and you° did not listen; and I spoke at length, and you° gave no heed;  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  025" id="1  025" >25</span>
 but you° set at nothing my counsels, and disregarded my reproofs;  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  026" id="1  026" >26</span>
 therefore I also will laugh at your destruction; and I will rejoice against   you   when ruin comes upon you:  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  027" id="1  027" >27</span>
 yes when dismay suddenly comes upon you, and   your   overthrow shall arrive like a tempest; and when tribulation and distress shall come upon you, or when ruin shall come upon you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  028" id="1  028" >28</span>
 For it shall be that when you° call upon me, I will not listen to you: wicked men shall seek me, but shall not find   me  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  029" id="1  029" >29</span>
 For they hated wisdom, and did not choose the word of the Lord:  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  030" id="1  030" >30</span>
 neither would they attend to my counsels, but derided my reproofs.  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  031" id="1  031" >31</span>
 Therefore shall they eat the fruits of their own way, and shall be filled with their own ungodliness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  032" id="1  032" >32</span>
 For because they wronged the simple, they shall be slain; and an inquisition shall ruin the ungodly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0201  033" id="1  033" >33</span>
 But he that hearkens to me shall dwell in  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. hope. See Ps 16.  </span>  confidence, and shall rest securely from all evil.  
<!-- 2   033 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span>    My   son, if you will receive the utterance of my commandment, and hide it with you;  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 your ear shall listen to wisdom; you shall also apply your heart to understanding, and shall apply it to the instruction of your son.  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 For it you shall call to wisdom, and utter your voice for understanding;  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 and if you shall seek it as silver, and search diligently for it as for treasures;  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 then shall you understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 For the Lord gives wisdom; and from his presence   come   knowledge and understanding,  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 and he treasures up salvation for them that walk uprightly: he will protect their way;  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 that he may guard the righteous ways: and he will preserve the way of them that fear him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 Then shall you understand righteousness, and judgment; and shall direct  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit. all good a les.  </span>  all your course aright.  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 For if wisdom shall come into your understanding, and discernment shall seem pleasing to your soul,  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 good counsel shall guard you, and holy understanding shall keep you;  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 to deliver you from the evil way, and from the man that speaks nothing faithfully.  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 Alas   for those   who forsake right paths, to walk in ways of darkness;  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 who rejoice in evils, and delight in wicked perverseness;  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 whose paths are crooked, and their  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit. wheel tracks. Compare Heb 12. 13.  </span>  courses winding;  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 to remove you far from the straight way, and to estrange you from a righteous purpose.   My   son, let not evil counsel overtake you,  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
    of her   who has forsaken the instruction of her youth, and forgotten the covenant of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 For she has fixed her house near death, and   guided   her wheels near Hades with the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See Heb.  </span>  giants.  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 None that go by her shall return, neither shall they take hold of right paths, for they are not apprehended of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Singular variation from Heb.  </span>  years of life.  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 For had they gone in good paths, they would have found the paths of righteousness  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. smooth.  </span>  easy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 For the upright shall dwell in the earth, and the holy shall be left behind in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0202  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 The paths of the ungodly shall perish out of the earth, and transgressors shall be driven away from it.

<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span>    My   son, forget not my laws; but let your heart keep my words:  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 for length of existence, and years of life, and peace, shall they add to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 Let not mercy and truth forsake you; but bind them about your neck:  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 so shall you find favor:  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex. + 'and write them on the table of your heart.'  </span>  and do you  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See Rom 12. 17.  </span>  provide things honest in the sight of the Lord, and of men.  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 Trust in God with all your heart; and be not exalted in your own wisdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 In all your ways acquaint yourself with her, that she may rightly  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. divide. See 2 Tim 2. 13.  </span>  direct your paths.  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 Be not wise in your own conceit; but fear God, and depart from all evil.  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 Then shall there be health to your body, and good keeping to your bones.  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 Honor the Lord with your just labors, and give him the first of your fruits of righteousness:  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 that your storehouses may be completely filled with corn, and that your presses may burst forth with wine.  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb 12. 5, 6.  </span>    My   son, despise not the chastening of the Lord; nor faint when you are rebuked of him:  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 for whom the Lord loves, he rebukes, and scourges every son whom he receives.  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 Blessed is the man who has found wisdom, and the mortal who knows prudence.  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 For it is better to traffic for her, than for treasures of gold and silver.  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 And she is more valuable than precious stones: no evil thing shall resist her: she is well known to all that approach her, and no precious thing is equal to her in value.  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 For length of existence and years of life are in her right hand; and in her left hand are wealth and glory: out of her mouth proceeds righteousness, and she carries law and mercy upon her tongue.  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 Her ways are good ways, and all her paths are peaceful.  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 She is a tree of life to all that lay hold upon her; and she is   a   secure   help   to all that stay themselves on her, as on the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  019" id="3  019" >19</span>
 God by wisdom founded the earth, and by prudence he prepared the heavens.  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  020" id="3  020" >20</span>
 By understanding were the depths broken up, and the clouds dropped water.  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  021" id="3  021" >21</span>
    My   son, let   them   not  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See Heb 2. 1.  </span>  pass from   you  , but keep my counsel and understanding:  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  022" id="3  022" >22</span>
 that your soul may live, and that there may be grace round your neck; and it shall be health to your flesh, and safety to your bones:  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  023" id="3  023" >23</span>
 that you may go confidently in peace in all your ways, and that your foot may not stumble.  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  024" id="3  024" >24</span>

 For every transgressor is unclean before the Lord; neither does he sit among the righteous.  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  033" id="3  033" >33</span>
 The curse of God is in the houses of the ungodly; but the habitations of the just are blessed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0203  034" id="3  034" >34</span>

 For a man's own lips become a strong snare to him, and he is caught with the lips of his own mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  003" id="6  003" >3</span>
    My   son, do what I command you, and deliver yourself; for on your friend's account you are come into the power of evil   men  : faint not, but stir up even your friend for whom you are become surety.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  004" id="6  004" >4</span>
 Give not sleep to your eyes, nor slumber with your eyelids;  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  005" id="6  005" >5</span>

 Go to the ant, O sluggard; and see, and emulate his ways, and become wiser than he.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  007" id="6  007" >7</span>
 For whereas he has no husbandry, nor any one to compel him, and is under no master,  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  008" id="6  008" >8</span>
 he prepares food for himself in the summer, and lays by abundant store in harvest. Or go to the bee, and learn how diligent she is, and how earnestly she is engaged in her work; whose labors kings and private men use for health, and she is desired and respected by all: though weak in  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. strength.  </span>  body, she is advanced by honouring wisdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  009" id="6  009" >9</span>
 How long will you lie, O sluggard? and when will you awake out of sleep?  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  010" id="6  010" >10</span>
 You sleep a little, and you rest a little, and you slumber a short   time  , and you fold your arms over your breast a little.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  011" id="6  011" >11</span>
 Then poverty comes upon you as an evil traveller, and lack as a swift courier: but if you be diligent, your harvest shall arrive as a fountain, and poverty shall flee away as a bad courier.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  012" id="6  012" >12</span>
 A foolish man and a transgressor goes in ways that are not good.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  013" id="6  013" >13</span>
 And the same winks with the eye, and makes a sign with his foot, and teaches with the beckonings of his fingers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  014" id="6  014" >14</span>
    His   perverse heart devises evils: at all times such a one causes troubles to a city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  015" id="6  015" >15</span>

 For he rejoices in all things which God hates, and he is ruined by reason of impurity of soul.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  017" id="6  017" >17</span>
 The eye of the haughty, a tongue unjust, hands shedding the blood of the just;  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  018" id="6  018" >18</span>
 and a heart devising evil thoughts, and feet hastening to do evil, —  are hateful to God  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  019" id="6  019" >19</span>

 but bind them upon your soul continually, and hang them as a chain about your neck.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  022" id="6  022" >22</span>
 Whenever you walk, lead this along and let it be with you; that it may talk with you when you wake.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  023" id="6  023" >23</span>
 For the commandment of the law is a lamp and a light; a way of life; reproof also and correction:  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  024" id="6  024" >24</span>
 to keep you continually from a married woman, and from the calumny of a strange tongue.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  025" id="6  025" >25</span>
 Let not the desire of beauty overcome you, neither be you caught by your eyes, neither be captivated with her eyelids.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  026" id="6  026" >26</span>
 For the value of a harlot is as much as of one loaf; and a woman hunts for the precious souls of men.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  027" id="6  027" >27</span>
 Shall any one bind fire in his bosom, and not burn his garments?  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  028" id="6  028" >28</span>
 or will any one walk on coals of fire, and not burn his feet?  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  029" id="6  029" >29</span>
 So is he that goes in to a married woman; he shall not be held guiltless, neither any one that touches her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  030" id="6  030" >30</span>
 It is not to be wondered at if one should be taken stealing, for he steals that when hungry he may satisfy his soul:  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  031" id="6  031" >31</span>
 but if he should be taken, he shall repay sevenfold, and shall deliver himself by giving all his goods.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  032" id="6  032" >32</span>
 But the adulterer through lack of sense procures destruction to his soul.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  033" id="6  033" >33</span>
 He endures both pain and disgrace, and his reproach shall never be wiped off.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  034" id="6  034" >34</span>
 For the soul of her husband is full of jealousy: he will not spare in the day of vengeance.  <span class="verse" rel="v0206  035" id="6  035" >35</span>

 when there happens   to be   the stillness of night and of darkness:  <span class="verse" rel="v0207  010" id="7  010" >10</span>
 and the woman meets him having the appearance of a harlot, that causes the hearts of young men to flutter.  <span class="verse" rel="v0207  011" id="7  011" >11</span>
 And she is fickle, and debauched, and her feet abide not at home.  <span class="verse" rel="v0207  012" id="7  012" >12</span>
 For at one time she wanders without, and at   another   time she lies in wait in the streets, at every corner.  <span class="verse" rel="v0207  013" id="7  013" >13</span>
 Then she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said to him,  <span class="verse" rel="v0207  014" id="7  014" >14</span>
 I have a peace-offering; today I pay my vows:  <span class="verse" rel="v0207  015" id="7  015" >15</span>

 Come, and let us enjoy love until the morning; come, and let us embrace in love.  <span class="verse" rel="v0207  019" id="7  019" >19</span>
 For my husband is not at home, but is gone on a long journey,  <span class="verse" rel="v0207  020" id="7  020" >20</span>
 having taken in his hand a bundle of money: after many days he will return to his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0207  021" id="7  021" >21</span>
 So with much converse she prevailed on him to go astray, and with the snares of her lips forced him from   the right path  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0207  022" id="7  022" >22</span>
 And he followed her, being gently led on, and   that   as an ox is led to the slaughter, and as a dog to bonds, or as a hart shot in the liver with an arrow:  <span class="verse" rel="v0207  023" id="7  023" >23</span>

 All the works of the humble   man   are manifest with God; but the ungodly shall perish in an evil day.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  005" id="16  005" >5</span>
 Every one that is proud in heart is unclean before God, and he that unjustly strikes hands with hand shall not be held guiltless. The beginning of a good way is to do justly; and it is more acceptable with God than to offer sacrifices. He that seeks the Lord shall find knowledge with righteousness: and they that rightly seek him shall find peace. All of the works of the Lord   are done   with righteousness; and the ungodly   man   is kept for the evil day.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  010" id="16  010" >10</span>
    There is   an oracle upon the lips of a king; and his mouth shall not err in judgment.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  011" id="16  011" >11</span>
 The poise of the balance is righteousness with the Lord; and his works are righteous measures.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  012" id="16  012" >12</span>
 An evil-doer is an abomination to a king; for the throne of rule is established by righteousness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  013" id="16  013" >13</span>
 Righteous lips are acceptable to a king; and he loves right words.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  014" id="16  014" >14</span>
 The anger of a king is a messenger of death; but a wise man will pacify him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  015" id="16  015" >15</span>
 The son of a king is in the light of life; and they that are in favor with him are as a cloud of latter rain.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  016" id="16  016" >16</span>
 The  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, Abodes. Comp. Heb. See Lu 13. 35.  </span>  brood of wisdom is more to be chosen than gold, and the brood of prudence more to be chosen than silver.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  017" id="16  017" >17</span>
 The paths of life turn aside from evil; and the ways of righteousness are length of life. He that receives instruction shall be in prosperity; and he that regards reproofs shall be made wise. He that keeps his ways, preserves his own soul; and he that loves his life will spare his mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  018" id="16  018" >18</span>
 Pride goes before destruction, and folly before a fall.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  019" id="16  019" >19</span>
 Better is a meek-spirited   man   with  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, affliction.  </span>  lowliness, than one who divides spoils with the proud.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  020" id="16  020" >20</span>
    He who is   skillful in business finds good: but he that trusts in God is most blessed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  021" id="16  021" >21</span>
    Men   call the wise and understanding evil: but they that are pleasing in speech shall hear more.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  022" id="16  022" >22</span>
 Understanding is a fountain of life to its possessors; but the instruction of fools is evil.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  023" id="16  023" >23</span>
 The heart of the wise will discern the   things which proceed   from his own mouth; and on his lips he will wear knowledge.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  024" id="16  024" >24</span>
 Good words are honeycombs, and the sweetness thereof is a healing of the soul.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  025" id="16  025" >25</span>
 There are ways that seem to be right to a man, but the end of them looks to the depth of hell.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  026" id="16  026" >26</span>
 A man who labors, labors for himself, and drives from   him   his own ruin.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  027" id="16  027" >27</span>
 But the perverse bears destruction upon his own mouth: a foolish man digs up evil for himself, and treasures fire on his own lips.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  028" id="16  028" >28</span>
 A perverse man spreads mischief, and will kindle a torch of deceit with mischiefs; and he separates friends.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  029" id="16  029" >29</span>
 A transgressor tries   to ensnare   friends, and leads them in ways   that are   not good.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  030" id="16  030" >30</span>
 And the man that fixes his eyes devises perverse things, and marks out with his lips all evil: he is a furnace of wickedness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  031" id="16  031" >31</span>
 Old age is a crown of  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. boasting.  </span>  honor, but it is found in the ways of righteousness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  032" id="16  032" >32</span>
 A man slow to anger is better than a strong   man  ; and he that governs   his   temper better than he that takes a city.  <span class="verse" rel="v02016  033" id="16  033" >33</span>
 All   evils   come upon the ungodly into   their   bosoms; but all righteous things   come   of the Lord.

 Every bad man stirs up strifes: but the Lord will send out against him an unmerciful messenger.  <span class="verse" rel="v02017  012" id="17  012" >12</span>
 Care may befall a man of understanding; but fools will meditate evils.  <span class="verse" rel="v02017  013" id="17  013" >13</span>
 Whoso rewards evil for good, evil shall not be removed from his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v02017  014" id="17  014" >14</span>
 Rightful rule gives power to words; but sedition and strife precede poverty.  <span class="verse" rel="v02017  015" id="17  015" >15</span>
 He that pronounces the unjust just, and the just unjust, is unclean and abominable with God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02017  016" id="17  016" >16</span>
 Why has the fool wealth? for a senseless man will not be able to purchase wisdom. He that exalts his own house seeks ruin; and he that turns aside from instruction shall fall into mischief.  <span class="verse" rel="v02017  017" id="17  017" >17</span>
 Have you a friend for every time, and let brethren be useful in distress; for on this account are they born.  <span class="verse" rel="v02017  018" id="17  018" >18</span>
 A foolish man applauds and rejoices over himself,   as he   also that becomes surety would make himself responsible for his own friends.  <span class="verse" rel="v02017  019" id="17  019" >19</span>
 A lover of sin rejoices in strifes;  <span class="verse" rel="v02017  020" id="17  020" >20</span>

 and the heart of a fool is grief to its possessor. A father rejoices not over an uninstructed son; but a wise son gladdens his mother.  <span class="verse" rel="v02017  022" id="17  022" >22</span>
 A glad heart promotes health; but the bones of a sorrowful man dry up.  <span class="verse" rel="v02017  023" id="17  023" >23</span>
 The ways of a man who unjustly receives gifts in   his   bosom do not prosper; and an ungodly man perverts the ways of righteousness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02017  024" id="17  024" >24</span>
 The countenance of a wise man is sensible; but the eyes of a fool   go   to the ends of the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02017  025" id="17  025" >25</span>
 A foolish son   is a cause of   anger to his father, and grief to her that bore him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02017  026" id="17  026" >26</span>
    It is   not right to punish a righteous man, nor   is it   holy to plot against righteous princes.  <span class="verse" rel="v02017  027" id="17  027" >27</span>
 He that forbears to utter a hard word is discreet, and a patient man is wise.  <span class="verse" rel="v02017  028" id="17  028" >28</span>
 Wisdom shall be imputed to a fool who asks after wisdom: and he who holds his peace shall seem to be sensible.

<p><span class="chapter" id="30  001">30  </span> These things says the man to them that trust in God; and I cease.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  002" id="30  002" >2</span>
 For I am the most simple of all men, and there is not in me the wisdom of men.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  003" id="30  003" >3</span>
 God has taught me wisdom, and I know the knowledge of the holy.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  004" id="30  004" >4</span>
 Who has gone up to heaven, and come down? who has gathered the winds in his  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, fold of his robe.  </span>  bosom? who has wrapped up the waters in a garment? who has dominion of all the ends of the earth? what is his name? or what is the name of his children?  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  005" id="30  005" >5</span>
 For all the words of God are tried in the fire, and he defends those that reverence him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  006" id="30  006" >6</span>
 Add not to his words, lest he reprove you, and you be made a liar.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  007" id="30  007" >7</span>
 Two things I ask of you; take not favor from me before I die.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  008" id="30  008" >8</span>
 Remove far from me vanity and falsehood: and give me not wealth   or   poverty; but appoint me what is needful and sufficient:  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  009" id="30  009" >9</span>
 lest I be filled and become false, and say, Who sees me? or be poor and steal, and swear   vainly   by the name of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  010" id="30  010" >10</span>
 Deliver not a servant into the hands of his master, lest he curse you, and you be utterly destroyed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  011" id="30  011" >11</span>
 A wicked generation curse their father, and do not bless their mother.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  012" id="30  012" >12</span>
 A wicked generation judge themselves to be just, but do not cleanse their way.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  013" id="30  013" >13</span>
 A wicked generation have lofty eyes, and exalt themselves with their eyelids.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  014" id="30  014" >14</span>
 A wicked generation have swords   for   teeth and jaw teeth   as   knives, so as to destroy and devour the lowly from the earth, and the poor of them from among men.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  015" id="30  015" >15</span>
 The horse-leech had three dearly beloved daughters: and these three did not satisfy her; and the fourth was not contented so as to say, Enough.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  016" id="30  016" >16</span>
 The grave, and the love of a woman, and the earth not filled with water; water also and fire will not say, It is enough.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  017" id="30  017" >17</span>
 The eye that laughs to scorn a father, and dishonors the old age of a mother, let the ravens of the valleys pick it out, and let the young eagles devour it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  018" id="30  018" >18</span>
 Moreover there are three things impossible for me to comprehend, and the fourth I know not:  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  019" id="30  019" >19</span>
 the track of a flying eagle; and the ways of a serpent on a rock; and the paths of a ship passing through the sea; and the ways of a man in youth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  020" id="30  020" >20</span>
 Such is the way of an adulterous woman, who having washed herself from what she has done, says she has done nothing  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. out of place.  </span>  amiss.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  021" id="30  021" >21</span>
 By three thing the earth is troubled, and the fourth it can’t bear:  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  022" id="30  022" >22</span>
 if a servant reign; or a fool be filled with food;  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  023" id="30  023" >23</span>
 or if a maidservant should cast out her own mistress; and if a hateful woman should marry a good man.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  024" id="30  024" >24</span>
 And   there are   four very little things upon the earth, but these are wiser than the wise:  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  025" id="30  025" >25</span>
 the ants which are weak, and   yet   prepare   their   food in summer;  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  026" id="30  026" >26</span>
 the rabbits also   are   a feeble race, who make their houses in the rocks.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  027" id="30  027" >27</span>
 The locusts have no king, and   yet   march orderly at one command.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  028" id="30  028" >28</span>
 And the eft, which supports itself by   its   hands, and is easily taken, dwells in the fortresses of kings.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  029" id="30  029" >29</span>
 And there are three things which go well, and a fourth which passes along finely.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  030" id="30  030" >30</span>
 A lion's whelp, stronger than   all other   beasts, which turns not away, nor fears   any   beast;  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  031" id="30  031" >31</span>
 and a cock walking in boldly among the hens, and the goat leading the herd; and a king publicly speaking before a nation.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  032" id="30  032" >32</span>
 If you abandon yourself to mirth, and stretch forth your hand in a quarrel, you shall be disgraced.  <span class="verse" rel="v02030  033" id="30  033" >33</span>
 Milk out milk, and there shall be butter, and if you wing   one's   nostrils there shall come out blood: so if you extort words, there will come forth quarrels and strifes.

 Princes are prone to anger: let them then not drink wine:  <span class="verse" rel="v02031  005" id="31  005" >5</span>
 lest they drink, and forget wisdom, and be not able to judge the poor rightly.  <span class="verse" rel="v02031  006" id="31  006" >6</span>

 Who shall find a virtuous woman? for such a one is more valuable than precious stones.  <span class="verse" rel="v02031  011" id="31  011" >11</span>
 The heart of her husband trusts in her: such a one shall stand in no need of fine spoils.  <span class="verse" rel="v02031  012" id="31  012" >12</span>
 For she employs all her living for her husband's good.  <span class="verse" rel="v02031  013" id="31  013" >13</span>
 Gathering wool and flax, she makes it serviceable with her hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v02031  014" id="31  014" >14</span>
 She is like a ship trading from a distance: so she procures her livelihood.  <span class="verse" rel="v02031  015" id="31  015" >15</span>
 And she rises by night, and gives food to her household, and   appointed   tasks to her maidens.  <span class="verse" rel="v02031  016" id="31  016" >16</span>
 She views a farm, and buys it: and with the fruit of her hands she plants and a possession.  <span class="verse" rel="v02031  017" id="31  017" >17</span>
 She strongly girds her loins, and strengthens her arms for work.  <span class="verse" rel="v02031  018" id="31  018" >18</span>
 And she finds by experience that working is good; and her candle goes not out all night.  <span class="verse" rel="v02031  019" id="31  019" >19</span>
 She reaches forth her arms to needful   works  , and applies her hands to the spindle.  <span class="verse" rel="v02031  020" id="31  020" >20</span>
 And she opens her hands to the needy, and reaches out fruit to the poor.  <span class="verse" rel="v02031  021" id="31  021" >21</span>
 Her husband is not anxious about those at home when he tarries anywhere abroad: for all  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. those with her.  </span>  her household are clothed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02031  022" id="31  022" >22</span>

 She puts on strength and honor; and rejoices in the last days.  <span class="verse" rel="v02031  026" id="31  026" >26</span>
 But she opens her mouth wisely, and according to law.  <span class="verse" rel="v02031  027" id="31  027" >27</span>
 The ways of her household are careful, and she eats not the bread of idleness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02031  028" id="31  028" >28</span>
