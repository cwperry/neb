<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">N</span>ow the word of the Lord came to Jonas the son of Amathi, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0321  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 Rise, and go to Nineve, the great city, and preach in it; for the cry of its wickedness is come up to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0321  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 But Jonas rose up to flee to Tharsis from the presence of the Lord. And he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tharsis: and he paid his fare, and went up into it, to sail with them to Tharsis from the presence of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0321  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And the Lord raised up a wind on the sea; and there was a great storm on the sea, and the ship was in danger of being broken.  <span class="verse" rel="v0321  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 And the sailors were alarmed, and cried every one to his god, and cast out the wares that were in the ship into the sea, that it might be lightened of them. But Jonas was gone down into the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   hollow.  </span>  hold of the ship, and was asleep, and snored.  <span class="verse" rel="v0321  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 And the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, Why snore you? arise, and call upon your God, that God may save us, and we perish not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0321  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 And each man said to his neighbor, Come, let us cast lots, and find out for whose sake this mischief is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonas.  <span class="verse" rel="v0321  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 And they said to him, Tell us  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.   + 'for those whose cause this evil is upon us'  </span>  what is your occupation, and whence come you, and of what country and what people are you?  <span class="verse" rel="v0321  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 And he said to them, I am a servant of the Lord; and I worship the Lord God of heaven, who made the sea, and the dry   land  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0321  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 Then the men feared exceedingly, and said to him, What is this   that   you have done? for the men knew that he was fleeing from the face of the Lord, because he had told them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0321  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 And they said to him, What shall we do to you, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   went.  </span>  rose, and lifted its wave exceedingly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0321  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 And Jonas said to them, Take me up, and cast me into the sea, and the sea shall be calm to you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0321  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 And the men tried hard to return to the land, and were not able: for the sea  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   went and rose up more.  </span>  rose and grew more and more tempestuous against them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0321  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 And they cried to the Lord, and said,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   by no means. See Acts 10. 14  </span>  Forbid it, Lord: let us not perish for the sake of this man's life, and bring not righteous blood upon us: for you, Lord, have done as you would.  <span class="verse" rel="v0321  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 So they took Jonas, and cast him out into the sea: and the sea ceased from its raging.  <span class="verse" rel="v0321  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 And the men feared the Lord very greatly, and offered a sacrifice to the Lord, and vowed vows.

<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> Now the Lord had commanded a great whale to swallow up Jonas: and Jonas was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights.  <span class="verse" rel="v0322  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 And Jonas prayed to the Lord his God out of the belly of the whale,  <span class="verse" rel="v0322  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 and said, I cried in my affliction to the Lord my God, and he listened to me,   even   to my cry out of the belly of hell: you heard my voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v0322  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 You did cast me into the depths of the heart of the sea, and the floods compassed me: all your billows and your waves have passed upon me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0322  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 And I said, I am cast out of your presence: shall I indeed look again toward your holy temple?  <span class="verse" rel="v0322  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 Water was poured around me to the soul: the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   last.  </span>  lowest deep compassed me, my head went down  <span class="verse" rel="v0322  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 to the clefts of the mountains; I went down into the earth, whose bars are the everlasting barriers: yet, O Lord my God, let my ruined life be restored.  <span class="verse" rel="v0322  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 When my soul was failing  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from me.  </span>  me, I remembered the Lord; and may my prayer come to you into your holy temple.  <span class="verse" rel="v0322  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 They that observe  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   vain and false   things.     </span>  vanities and lies have forsaken their own mercy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0322  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of praise and thanksgiving: all that I have vowed I will pay to you,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   for a thank-offering to the Lord.  </span>  the Lord of   my   salvation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0322  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 And the whale was commanded by the Lord, and it cast up Jonas on the dry   land  .  
<!-- 3   011 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> And the word of the Lord came to Jonas the second time, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0323  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 Rise, go to Nineve, the great city, and preach in it according to the former preaching which I spoke to you of.  <span class="verse" rel="v0323  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 And Jonas arose, and went to Nineve, as the Lord had spoken. Now Nineve was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   a great city to God. Acts 7. 20.  </span>  an exceeding great city, of about three days' journey.  <span class="verse" rel="v0323  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 And Jonas began to enter into the city about a day's journey, and he proclaimed, and said, Yet three days, and Nineve shall be overthrown.  <span class="verse" rel="v0323  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 And the men of Nineve believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloths, from the greatest of them to the least of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0323  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 And the word reached the king of Nineve, and he arose from off his throne, and took off his raiment from him, and put on sackcloth, and sat on ashes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0323  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 And proclamation was made, and it was commanded in Nineve by the king an by his great men, saying, Let not men, or cattle, or oxen, or sheep, taste   any thing  , nor feed, nor drink water.  <span class="verse" rel="v0323  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 So men and cattle were clothed with sackcloths, and cried earnestly to God; and they turned every one from their evil way, and from the iniquity that was in their hands, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0323  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 Who knows if God will repent, and turn from his fierce anger, and   so   we shall not perish?  <span class="verse" rel="v0323  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil ways; and God repented of the evil which he had said he would do to them; and he did   it   not.  
<!-- 4   010 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> But Jonas was very deeply grieved, and he was confounded.  <span class="verse" rel="v0324  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 And he prayed to the Lord, and said, O Lord, were not these my words when I was yet in my land? therefore I  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   anticipate.  </span>  made haste to flee to Tharsis; because I knew that you are merciful and compassionate, longsuffering, and abundant in kindness, and repent of evil.  <span class="verse" rel="v0324  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 And now,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   sovereign Lord.  </span>  Lord God, take my life from me; for   it is   better for me to die than to live.  <span class="verse" rel="v0324  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 And the Lord said to Jonas, Are you very much grieved?  <span class="verse" rel="v0324  005" id="4  005" >5</span>
 And Jonas went out from the city, and sat over against the city; and he made for himself there a booth, and he sat under it, until he should perceive what would become of the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0324  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 And the Lord God commanded a gourd, and it came up over the head of Jonas, to be a shadow over his head, to shade him from his calamities: and Jonas rejoiced with great joy for the gourd.  <span class="verse" rel="v0324  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 And God commanded a worm the next morning, and it struck the gourd, and it withered away.  <span class="verse" rel="v0324  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 And it came to pass at the rising of the sun, that God commanded a burning east wind; and the sun struck on the head of Jonas, and he fainted, and despaired of his life, and said,   It is   better for me to die than to live.  <span class="verse" rel="v0324  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 And God said to Jonas, Are you very much grieved for the gourd? And he said, I am very much grieved, even to death.  <span class="verse" rel="v0324  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 And the Lord said, You had pity on the gourd, for which you have not suffered, neither did you rear it; which came up  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   little before.  </span>  before night, and perished before   another   night:  <span class="verse" rel="v0324  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 and shall not I spare Nineve, the great city, in which dwell more than twelve myriads of human beings, who do not know their right hand or their left hand; and   also   much cattle?
