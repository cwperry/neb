<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">T</span>he vision which Esaias the son of Amos saw, which he saw against Juda, and against Jerusalem, in the reign of Ozias, and Joatham, and Achaz, and Ezekias, who reigned over Judea.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 Hear, O heaven, and listen, O earth: for the Lord has spoken,   saying  , I have begotten and reared up children, but they have  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   'set me at nothing.'  </span>  rebelled against me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel does not know me, and the people has not regarded me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 Ah sinful nation, a people full of sins, an evil seed, lawless children: you° have forsaken the Lord, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 Why should you° be struck   any   more, transgressing more and more? the whole head is pained, and the whole heart sad.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 From the feet to the head, there is no soundness in them; neither wound, nor bruise, nor festering ulcer   are healed  : it is not possible to apply a plaister, nor oil, nor bandages.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 Your land is desolate, your cities burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is made desolate, overthrown by strange nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 The daughter of Sion shall be deserted as a tent in a vineyard, and as a storehouse of fruits in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
   <span class="xrefmarker">*</span><span class="xref">        Rom 9. 29.  </span>  And if the Lord of Sabaoth had not left us a seed, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been made like Gomorrha.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 Hear the word of the Lord, you° rulers of Sodoma; attend to the law of God, you people of Gomorrha.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 Of what   value   to me is the abundance of your sacrifices? says the Lord: I am full of whole burnt offerings of rams; and I delight not in the fat of lambs, and the blood of bulls and goats:  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 neither shall you° come   with these   to appear before me; for who has required these things at your hands? You° shall no more tread my court.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 Though you° bring fine flour,   it is   vain; incense is an abomination to me; I can’t bear your new moons, and your sabbaths, and the great day;  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
    your   fasting, and rest from work, your new moons also, and your feasts my soul hates: you° have become loathsome to me; I will no more pardon your sins.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 When you° stretch forth your hands, I will turn away my eyes from you: and though you° make many supplications, I will not listen to you; for your hands are full of blood.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 Wash you, be clean; remove your iniquities from your souls before my eyes; cease from your iniquities;  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 learn to do well; diligently seek judgment, deliver him that is suffering wrong, plead for the orphan, and obtain justice for the widow.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 And come, let us reason together, says the Lord: and though your sins be as purple, I will make them white as snow; and though they be as scarlet, I will make   them   white as wool.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 And if you° be willing, and listen to me, you° shall eat the good of the land:  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 but if you° be not willing, nor listen to me, a sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  021" id="1  021" >21</span>
 How has the faithful city Sion,   once   full of judgment, become a harlot! wherein righteousness lodged, but now murderers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  022" id="1  022" >22</span>
 Your silver is worthless, your wine merchants mix the wine with water.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  023" id="1  023" >23</span>
 Your princes are rebellious, companions of thieves, loving bribes, seeking after rewards; not pleading for orphans, and not heeding the cause of widows.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  024" id="1  024" >24</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord, the Lord of hosts, Woe to the mighty   men   of Israel; for my wrath shall not cease against my adversaries, and I will execute judgment on my enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  025" id="1  025" >25</span>
 And I will bring my hand upon you, and purge you  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to pureness.  </span>  completely, and I will destroy the rebellious, and will take away from you all transgressors.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  026" id="1  026" >26</span>
 And I will establish your judges as before, and your counselors as at the beginning: and afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful mother-city of Sion.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  027" id="1  027" >27</span>
 For her captives shall be saved with judgment, and with mercy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  028" id="1  028" >28</span>
 And the transgressors and the sinners shall be crushed together, and they that forsake the Lord shall be utterly consumed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  029" id="1  029" >29</span>
 For they shall be ashamed of their idols, which they delighted in, and they are made ashamed of the gardens which they coveted.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  030" id="1  030" >30</span>
 For they shall be as a turpentine tree that has cast its leaves, and as a garden that has no water.  <span class="verse" rel="v0231  031" id="1  031" >31</span>
 And their strength shall be as a thread of tow, and their works as sparks, and the transgressors and the sinners shall be burnt up together, and there shall be none to quench   them  .

<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> The word which came to Esaias the son of Amos concerning Judea, and concerning Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 For in the last days the mountain of the Lord shall be  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   conspicuous.  </span>  glorious, and the house of God   shall be   on the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall come to it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 And many nations shall go and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will tell us his way, and we will walk in it: for out of Sion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into sickles: and nation shall not take up sword against nation, neither shall they learn to war any more.  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 And now, O house of Jacob, come,   and   let us walk in the light of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 For he has forsaken his people the house of Israel, because their land is filled as at the beginning with divinations, as the   land   of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   aliens, see   Appendix   which has: “ISAIAH 2. 6. — Philistines. The LXX. generally render by Φιλιστεὶμ or Φυλιστιὶμ till about the middle of Judges, after which the word almost always used is ἀλλόφυλοι. In this there was probably some accommodation of sound to tense.  </span>  Philistines, and many strange children were born to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 For their land is filled with silver and gold, and there was no number of their treasures; their land also is filled with horses, and there was no number of chariots.  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 And the land is filled with abominations,   even   the works of their hands; and they have worshipped   the works   which their fingers made.  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 And the mean man bowed down, and the great man was humbled: and I will not pardon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 Now therefore enter you° into the rocks, and hide yourselves in the earth, for fear of the Lord, and by reason of the glory of his might, when he shall arise to strike terribly the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 For the eyes of the Lord are high, but man is low; and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and haughty, and upon every one that is high and towering, and they shall be brought down;  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 and upon every cedar of Libanus, of them that are high and towering, and upon every oak of Basan,  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 and upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill,  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 and upon every high tower, and upon every high wall,  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 and upon every ship of the sea, and upon every display of fine ships.  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 And every man shall be brought low, and the pride of men shall fall: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 And they shall hide all   idols   made with hands,  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 having carried   them   into the caves, and into the clefts of the rocks, and into the caverns of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See ver 10.  </span>  by reason of the glory of his might, when he shall arise to strike terribly the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 For in that day a man shall cast forth his silver and gold abominations, which they made   in order   to worship vanities and bats;  <span class="verse" rel="v0232  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 to enter into the caverns of the solid rock, and into the clefts of the rocks, for fear of the Lord, and by reason of the glory of his might, when he shall arise to strike terribly the earth.

<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> Behold now, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, will take away from Jerusalem and from Judea the mighty man and mighty woman, the strength of bread, and the strength of water,  <span class="verse" rel="v0233  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 the great and mighty man, the warrior and the judge, and the prophet, and the counsellor, and the elder,  <span class="verse" rel="v0233  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 the captain of fifty also, and the honorable counsellor, and the wise artificer, and the intelligent hearer.  <span class="verse" rel="v0233  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 And I will make youths their princes, and mockers shall have dominion over them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0233  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 And the people shall fall, man upon man, and   every   man upon his neighbor: the child shall insult the elder man, and the base the honorable.  <span class="verse" rel="v0233  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 For a man shall lay hold of his brother, as one of his father's household, saying, You have raiment, be you our ruler, and let my meat be under you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0233  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 And he shall answer in that day, and say, I will not be your ruler; for I have no bread in my house, nor raiment: I will not be the ruler of this people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0233  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 For Jerusalem is  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   forsaken,   or,   let go.  </span>  ruined, and Judea has fallen, and their tongues   have spoken   with iniquity, disobedient   as they are   towards the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0233  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 Therefore now their glory has been brought low, and the shame of their countenance has withstood them, and they have proclaimed their sin as Sodom, and made it manifest.  <span class="verse" rel="v0233  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 Woe to their soul, for they have devised an evil counsel against themselves, saying against themselves, Let us bind the just, for he is burdensome to us: therefore shall they eat the fruits of their works.  <span class="verse" rel="v0233  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 Woe to the transgressor! evils shall happen to him according to the works of his hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v0233  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 O my people, your exactors  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   glean you.  </span>  strip you, and extortioners rule over you: O my people, they that pronounce you blesses lead you astray, and pervert the path of your feet.  <span class="verse" rel="v0233  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 But now the Lord will stand up for judgment, and will enter into judgment with his people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0233  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 The Lord himself shall enter into judgment with the elders of the people, and with their rulers: but why have you° set my vineyard on fire, and   why is   the spoil of the poor in your houses?  <span class="verse" rel="v0233  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 Why do you° wrong my people, and shame the face of the poor?  <span class="verse" rel="v0233  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 Thus says the Lord, Because the daughters of Sion are haughty, and have walked with an outstretched neck, and with winking of the eyes, and motion of the feet, at the same time drawing their garments in trains, and at the same time sporting with their feet:  <span class="verse" rel="v0233  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 therefore the Lord will humble the chief daughters of Sion, and the Lord will expose their form in that day;  <span class="verse" rel="v0233  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 and the Lord will take away the glory of their raiment, the curls and the fringes, and the crescents,  <span class="verse" rel="v0233  019" id="3  019" >19</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> Now I will sing to   my   beloved a song of my beloved concerning my vineyard.   My   beloved had a vineyard on a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   horn, so   Heb.  </span>  high hill in a fertile place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0235  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 And I made a hedge round it, and dug a trench, and planted a choice vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and dug a place for the wine-vat in it: and I waited   for it   to bring forth grapes, and it brought forth thorns.  <span class="verse" rel="v0235  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 And now, you° dwellers in Jerusalem, and   every   man of Juda, judge between me and my vineyard.  <span class="verse" rel="v0235  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 What shall I do any more to my vineyard, that I have not done to it? Whereas I expected   it   to bring forth grapes, but it has brought forth thorns.  <span class="verse" rel="v0235  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be for a spoil; and I will pull down its walls, and it shall be   left   to be trodden down.  <span class="verse" rel="v0235  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 And I will forsake my vineyard; and it shall not be pruned, nor dug, and thorns shall come up upon it as on barren land; and I will command the clouds to rain no rain upon it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0235  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a man.  </span>  the men of Juda   his   beloved plant: I expected   it   to bring forth judgment, and it brought forth iniquity; and not righteousness, but a cry.  <span class="verse" rel="v0235  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 Woe   to them   that join house to house, and add field to field, that they may take away something of their neighbor's: will you° dwell alone upon the land?  <span class="verse" rel="v0235  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 For these things have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts: for though many houses should be built, many and fair houses shall be desolate, and there shall be no inhabitants in them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0235  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 For where ten yoke of oxen plow   the land   shall yield one , and he that sows six homers shall produce three measures.  <span class="verse" rel="v0235  011" id="5  011" >11</span>

 Woe   to them   that are wise in their own conceit, and knowing in their own sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v0235  022" id="5  022" >22</span>
 Woe to the strong   ones   of you that drink wine, and the mighty   ones   that mingle strong drink:  <span class="verse" rel="v0235  023" id="5  023" >23</span>
 who justify the ungodly for rewards, and take away the righteousness of the righteous.  <span class="verse" rel="v0235  024" id="5  024" >24</span>
 Therefore as stubble shall be burnt by a coal of fire, and shall be consumed by a violent flame, their root shall be as chaff, and their flower shall go up as dust: for they rejected the law of the Lord of hosts, and insulted the word of the Holy One of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0235  025" id="5  025" >25</span>
 Therefore the Lord of hosts was greatly angered against his people, and he reached forth his hand upon them, and struck them: and the mountains were troubled, and their carcasses were as dung in the midst of the way: yet for all this his anger has not been turned away, but his hand is yet  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.

 They shall not hunger nor be weary, neither shall they slumber nor sleep; neither shall they loose their girdles from their loins, neither shall their shoe-latchets be broken.  <span class="verse" rel="v0235  028" id="5  028" >28</span>

 They rage as lions, and draw near as a lion's whelps: and he shall seize, and roar as a wild beast, and he shall cast   them   forth, and there shall be none to deliver them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0235  030" id="5  030" >30</span>
 And he shall roar on account of them in that day, as the sound of the swelling sea; and they shall look to the land, and, behold,   there shall be   thick darkness in their perplexity.

 And a message was brought to the house of David, saying, Aram has conspired with Ephraim. And his soul was amazed, and the soul of his people, as in a wood a tree is moved by the wind.  <span class="verse" rel="v0237  003" id="7  003" >3</span>
 And the Lord said to Esaias, Go forth to meet Achaz, you, and your son Jasub who is left, to the pool of the upper way of the fuller's field.  <span class="verse" rel="v0237  004" id="7  004" >4</span>

 And   as for   the son of Aram, and the son of Romelias, forasmuch as they have devised an evil counsel,   saying  ,  <span class="verse" rel="v0237  006" id="7  006" >6</span>

 But the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus, Rasim; and yet within sixty and five years the kingdom of Ephraim shall cease from   being   a people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0237  009" id="7  009" >9</span>

 In that day there shall be five cities in Egypt speaking the language of Chanaan, and swearing by the name of the Lord of hosts; one city shall be called the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. city of destruction  </span>  city of Asedec.  <span class="verse" rel="v02319  019" id="19  019" >19</span>

 In that day there shall be a way from Egypt to the Assyrians, and the Assyrians shall enter into Egypt, and the Egyptians shall go to the Assyrians, and the Egyptians shall serve the Assyrians.  <span class="verse" rel="v02319  024" id="19  024" >24</span>

    so   a fearful and a grievous vision was declared to me: he that is treacherous deals treacherously, the transgressor transgresses.

 For   it is   a day of trouble, and of destruction, and of treading down, and   there is   perplexity   sent   from the Lord of hosts: they wander in the valley of Sion; they wander from the least to the greatest on the mountains.  <span class="verse" rel="v02322  006" id="22  006" >6</span>
 And the Elamites took   their   quivers, and   there were   men mounted on horses, and   there was   a gathering for battle.  <span class="verse" rel="v02322  007" id="22  007" >7</span>
 And it shall be   that   your choice valleys shall be filled with chariots, and horsemen shall block up your gates.  <span class="verse" rel="v02322  008" id="22  008" >8</span>
 And they shall uncover the gates of Juda, and they shall look in that day on the choice houses of the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v02322  009" id="22  009" >9</span>
 And they shall uncover the secret places of the houses of the citadel of David: and they saw that they were many, and that one   had   turned the water of the old pool into the city;  <span class="verse" rel="v02322  010" id="22  010" >10</span>
 and that they   had   pulled down the houses of Jerusalem, to fortify the wall of the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v02322  011" id="22  011" >11</span>
 And you° procured to yourselves water between the two walls within the ancient pool: but you° looked not to him that made it from the beginning, and regarded not him that created it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02322  012" id="22  012" >12</span>

 And you shall be removed from your stewardship, and from your place.  <span class="verse" rel="v02322  020" id="22  020" >20</span>
 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Chelcias:  <span class="verse" rel="v02322  021" id="22  021" >21</span>
 and I will put on him your robe, and I will grant him your crown with power, and I will give your stewardship into his hands: and he shall be as a father to them that dwell in Jerusalem, and to them that dwell in Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v02322  022" id="22  022" >22</span>
 And I will give him the glory of David; and he shall rule, and there shall be none to speak against him: and I will give him the key  <span class="xrefmarker">*</span><span class="xref">        Rev 3. 7.  </span>  of the house of David   upon   his shoulder; and he shall open, and there shall be none to shut; and he shall shut, and there shall be none to open.  <span class="verse" rel="v02322  023" id="22  023" >23</span>
 And I will make him a ruler in a sure place, and he shall be for a glorious throne of his father's house.  <span class="verse" rel="v02322  024" id="22  024" >24</span>
 And every one that is glorious in the house of his father shall trust in him, from the least to the greatest; and they shall depend upon him in that day.  <span class="verse" rel="v02322  025" id="22  025" >25</span>
 Thus says the Lord of hosts, The man that is fastened in the sure place shall be removed and be taken away, and shall fall; and the glory that is upon him shall be utterly destroyed: for the Lord has spoken it.

 For the black poppy is not cleansed with harsh treatment, nor will a wagon-wheel pass over the cumin; but the black poppy is threshed with a rod, and the cumin shall be eaten with bread;  <span class="verse" rel="v02328  028" id="28  028" >28</span>

 For by the voice of the Lord the Assyrians shall be overcome,   even   by the stroke wherewith he shall strike them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02330  032" id="30  032" >32</span>

 And the dry land shall become pools, and a fountain of water shall   be poured   into the thirsty land; there shall there be a joy of birds, ready habitations and marshes.  <span class="verse" rel="v02335  008" id="35  008" >8</span>
 There shall be there a pure way, and it shall be called a holy way; and there shall not pass by there any unclean person, neither shall there be there an unclean way; but the dispersed shall walk on it, and they shall not go astray.  <span class="verse" rel="v02335  009" id="35  009" >9</span>
 And there shall be no lion there, neither shall any evil beast go up upon it, nor at all be found there; but the redeemed and gathered on the Lord's behalf, shall walk in it,  <span class="verse" rel="v02335  010" id="35  010" >10</span>
 and shall return, and come to Sion with joy, and everlasting joy   shall be   over their head; for on their head   shall be   praise and exultation, and joy shall take possession of them: sorrow and pain, and groaning have fled away.

<p><span class="chapter" id="36  001">36  </span> Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of the reign of Ezekias,   that   Sennacherim, king of the Assyrians, came up against the strong cities of Judea, and took them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  002" id="36  002" >2</span>
 And the king of the Assyrians sent Rabsaces out of Laches to Jerusalem to king Ezekias with a large force: and he stood by the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in  </span>  conduit of the upper pool in the way of the fuller's field.  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  003" id="36  003" >3</span>
 And there went forth to him Heliakim the steward, the   son   of Chelcias, and Somnas the scribe, and Joach the   son   of Asaph, the recorder.  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  004" id="36  004" >4</span>
 And Rabsaces said to them, Say to Ezekias, Thus says the great king, the king of the Assyrians, Why are you secure?  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  005" id="36  005" >5</span>
 Is war carried on with counsel and   mere   words of the lips? and now on whom do you trust, that you rebel against me?  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  006" id="36  006" >6</span>
 Behold, you trust on this bruised staff of reed, on Egypt:   as soon   as a man leans upon it, it shall go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharao king of Egypt and all that trust in him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  007" id="36  007" >7</span>
 But if you° say, We trust in the Lord our God;  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  008" id="36  008" >8</span>
 yet now make an agreement with my lord the king of the Assyrians, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you° shall be able to set riders upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  009" id="36  009" >9</span>
 And how can you°   then   turn to the face of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   local governors  </span>  satraps? They that trust on the Egyptians for horse and rider, are   our   servants.  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  010" id="36  010" >10</span>
 And now, Have we come up against this land to fight against it without the Lord? The Lord said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  011" id="36  011" >11</span>
 Then Eliakim and Somnas and Joach said to him, Speak to your servants in the Syrian tongue; for we understand   it  : and speak not to us in the Jewish tongue: and therefore speak you in the ears of the men on the wall?  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  012" id="36  012" >12</span>
 And Rabsaces said to them, Has my lord sent me to your lord or to you, to speak these words?   has he   not   sent   me to the men that sit on the wall, that they may eat dung, and drink   their   water together with you?  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  013" id="36  013" >13</span>
 And Rabsaces stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish language, and said, Hear you° the words of the great king, the king of the Assyrians:  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  014" id="36  014" >14</span>
 thus says the king, Let not Ezekias deceive you with words: he will not be able to deliver you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  015" id="36  015" >15</span>
 And let not Ezekias say to you, That God will deliver you, and this city will not at all be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians.  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  016" id="36  016" >16</span>
 Listen not to Ezekias: thus says the king of the Assyrians, If you° wish to be blessed, come out to me: and you° shall eat every one   of   his vine and his fig-trees, and you° shall drink water out of your own cisterns:  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  017" id="36  017" >17</span>
 until I come and take you to a land, like your own land, a land of corn and wine, and bread, and vineyards.  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  018" id="36  018" >18</span>
 Let not Ezekias deceive you, saying, God will deliver you. Have the gods of the nations delivered each one his own land out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians?  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  019" id="36  019" >19</span>
 Where is the god of Emath, and Arphath? and where is the god of Eppharuaim? have they been able to deliver Samaria out of my hand?  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  020" id="36  020" >20</span>
 Which is the god of all these nations, that has delivered his land out of my hand, that God should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  021" id="36  021" >21</span>
 And they were silent, and none answered him a word; because the king had commanded that none should answer.  <span class="verse" rel="v02336  022" id="36  022" >22</span>
 And Heliakim the   son   of Chelcias, the steward, and Somnas the military scribe, and Joach the   son   of Asaph, the recorder, came in to Ezekias, having their garments tore, and they reported to him the words of Rabsaces.  
<!-- 37   022 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="37  001">37  </span> And it came to pass, when king Ezekias heard   it, that   he tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth, and went up to the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  002" id="37  002" >2</span>
 And he sent Heliakim the steward, and Somnas the scribe, and the elders of the priests clothed with sackcloth, to Esaias the son of Amos, the prophet. And they said to him, Thus says Ezekias,  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  003" id="37  003" >3</span>
 To-day is a day of affliction, and reproach, and rebuke, and anger: for the pangs are come upon the travailing   woman  , but she has not strength to bring forth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  004" id="37  004" >4</span>
 May the Lord your God hear the words of Rabsaces, which the king of the Assyrians has sent, to reproach the living God, even to reproach with the words which the Lord your God has heard: therefore you shall pray to your Lord for these that are left.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  005" id="37  005" >5</span>
 So the servants of king Ezekias came to Esaias.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  006" id="37  006" >6</span>
 And Esaias said to them, Thus shall you° say to your master, Thus says the Lord, Be not you afraid at the words which you have heard, wherewith the ambassadors of the king of the Assyrians have reproached me,  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  007" id="37  007" >7</span>
 Behold, I   will   send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a report, and return to his own country, and he shall fall by the sword in his own land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  008" id="37  008" >8</span>
 So Rabsaces returned, and found the king of the Assyrians besieging Lobna: for he had heard that he had departed from Lachis.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  009" id="37  009" >9</span>
 And Tharaca king of the Ethiopians went forth to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   besiege  </span>  attack him. And when he heard it, he turned aside, and sent messengers to Ezekias, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  010" id="37  010" >10</span>
 Thus shall you° say to Ezekias king of Judea, Let not your God, in whom you trust, deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  011" id="37  011" >11</span>
 Hast you not heard what the kings of the Assyrians have done, how they have destroyed the whole earth? and shall you be delivered?  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  012" id="37  012" >12</span>
 Have the gods of the nations which my fathers destroyed delivered them, both Gozan, and Charrhan, and Rapheth, which are in the land of Theemath?  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  013" id="37  013" >13</span>
 Where are the kings of Emath? and where   is the king of   Arphath? and where   is the king   of the city of Eppharuaim,   and of   Anagugana?  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  014" id="37  014" >14</span>
 And Ezekias received the letter from the messengers, and read it, and went up to the house of the Lord, and opened it before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  015" id="37  015" >15</span>
 And Ezekias prayed to the Lord, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  016" id="37  016" >16</span>
 O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, who sit upon the cherubs, you alone are the God of every kingdom of the world: you have made heaven and earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  017" id="37  017" >17</span>
 Incline your ear, O Lord, listen, O Lord; open your eyes, O Lord, look, O Lord: and behold the words of Sennacherim, which he has sent to reproach the living God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  018" id="37  018" >18</span>
 For of a truth, Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have laid waste the whole world, and the countries thereof,  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  019" id="37  019" >19</span>
 and have cast their idols into the fire: for, they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; and they have cast them away.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  020" id="37  020" >20</span>
 But now, O Lord our God, deliver us from his hands, that every kingdom of the earth may know that you are God alone.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  021" id="37  021" >21</span>
 And Esaias the son of Amos was sent to Ezekias, and said to him, Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, I have heard your prayer to me concerning Sennacherim king of the Assyrians.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  022" id="37  022" >22</span>
 This is the word which God has spoken concerning him; The virgin daughter of Sion has despised you, and mocked you; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  023" id="37  023" >23</span>
 Whom have you reproached and provoked? and against whom have you lifted up your voice? and have you not lifted up your eyes on high against the Holy One of Israel?  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  024" id="37  024" >24</span>
 For you have reproached the Lord by messengers; for you have said, With the multitude of chariots have I ascended to the height of mountains, and to the sides of Libanus; and I have  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   cut  </span>  cropped the height of his cedars and the beauty of his cypresses; and I entered into the height of the forest region:  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  025" id="37  025" >25</span>
 and I have made a bridge, and dried up the waters, and every pool of water.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  026" id="37  026" >26</span>
 Hast you not heard of these things which I did of old? I appointed   them   from ancient times; but now have I manifested   my purpose   of desolating nations in   their   strong holds, and them that dwell in strong cities.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  027" id="37  027" >27</span>
 I weakened   their   hands, and they withered; and they became as dry grass on the housetops, and as grass.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  028" id="37  028" >28</span>
 But now I know your rest, and your going out, and your coming in.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  029" id="37  029" >29</span>
 And your wrath wherewith you have been enraged, and your rancour has come up to me; therefore I will put a hook in your nose, and a bit in your lips, and will turn you back by the way by which you came.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  030" id="37  030" >30</span>
 And this shall be a sign to you, Eat this year what you have sown; and the second year that which is left: and the third year sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  031" id="37  031" >31</span>
 And they that are left in Judea shall take root downward, and bear fruit upward:  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  032" id="37  032" >32</span>
 for out of Jerusalem there shall be  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   the left men  </span>  a remnant, and the saved ones out of mount Sion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall perform this.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  033" id="37  033" >33</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king of the Assyrians, He shall not enter into this city, nor cast a weapon against it, nor bring a shield against it, nor make a rampart round it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  034" id="37  034" >34</span>
 But by the way by which he came, by it shall he return, and shall not enter into this city: thus says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  035" id="37  035" >35</span>
 I will protect this city to save it for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  036" id="37  036" >36</span>
 And the angel of the Lord went forth, and killed out of the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand: and they arose in the morning and found all   these   bodies dead.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  037" id="37  037" >37</span>
 And Sennacherim king of the Assyrians turned and departed, and lived in Nineve.  <span class="verse" rel="v02337  038" id="37  038" >38</span>
 And while he was worshipping Nasarach his country's god in the house, Adramelech and Sarasar his sons struck him with swords; and they escaped into Armenia: and Asordan his son reigned in his stead.  
<!-- 38   038 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="38  001">38  </span> And it came to pass at that time,   that   Ezekias was sick even to death. And Esaias the prophet the son of Amos came to him, and said to him, Thus says the Lord, Give orders concerning your house: for you shall die, and not live.  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  002" id="38  002" >2</span>
 And Ezekias turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  003" id="38  003" >3</span>
 Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before you in truth, with a true heart, and have done that which was pleasing in your sight. And Ezekias wept bitterly.  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  004" id="38  004" >4</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to Esaias, saying, Go, and say to Ezekias,  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  005" id="38  005" >5</span>
 Thus says the Lord, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, and seen your tears: behold, I   will   add to your time fifteen years.  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  006" id="38  006" >6</span>
 And I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians: and I will defend this city.  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  007" id="38  007" >7</span>
 And this   shall be   a sign to you from the Lord, that God will do this thing;  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  008" id="38  008" >8</span>
 behold, I will turn back the shadow of the degrees   of the dial   by which ten degrees on the house of your father the sun has gone down—I will turn back the sun the ten degrees; so the sun went back the ten degrees by which the shadow had gone down.  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  009" id="38  009" >9</span>
 THE PRAYER OF EZEKIAS KING OF JUDEA, WHEN HE  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   was sick  </span>  HAD BEEN SICK, AND WAS RECOVERED FROM HIS SICKNESS.  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  010" id="38  010" >10</span>
 I said in the end of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I shall part with the remainder of my years.  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  011" id="38  011" >11</span>
 I said, I shall no more at all see the salvation of God in the land of the living: I shall no more at all see the salvation of Israel on the earth: I shall no more at all see man.  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  012" id="38  012" >12</span>
    My life   has failed from among my kindred: I have parted with the remainder of my life: it has gone forth and departed from me, as one that having pitched a tent takes it down   again  : my breath was with me as a weaver's web, when she that weaves draws near to cut off   the   thread.  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  013" id="38  013" >13</span>
 In that day I was given up as to a lion until the morning: so has he broken all my bones: for I was so given up from day   even   to night.  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  14-15" id="38  14-15" >14-15</span>
 As a swallow, so will I cry, and as a dove, so do I mourn: for my eyes have failed with looking to the height of heaven to the Lord, who has delivered me, and removed the sorrow of my soul.  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  016" id="38  016" >16</span>
    Yes  , O Lord, for it was told you concerning this; and you have revived my breath; and I am comforted, and live.  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  017" id="38  017" >17</span>
 For you have chosen my soul, that it should not perish: and you have cast all   my   sins behind me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  018" id="38  018" >18</span>
 For they that are in the grave shall not praise you, neither shall the dead bless you, neither shall they that are in Hades hope for your mercy.  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  019" id="38  019" >19</span>
 The living shall bless you, as I also   do  : for from this day shall I beget children, who shall declare your righteousness,  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  020" id="38  020" >20</span>
 O God of my salvation; and I will not cease blessing you with the lute all the days of my life before the house of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  021" id="38  021" >21</span>
 Now Esaias had said to Ezekias; Take a cake of figs, and mash them, and apply them as a plaster, and you shall be well.  <span class="verse" rel="v02338  022" id="38  022" >22</span>
 And Ezekias said, This is a sign to Ezekias, that I shall go up to the house of God.

<p><span class="chapter" id="39  001">39  </span> At that time Marodach Baladan, the son of Baladan, the king of Babylonia, sent letters and ambassadors and gifts to Ezekias: for he had heard that he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   was  </span>  had been sick   even   to death, and was recovered.  <span class="verse" rel="v02339  002" id="39  002" >2</span>
 And Ezekias was glad of their coming, and he showed them the house of   his   spices, and of silver, and gold, and myrrh, and incense, and ointment, and all the houses of his treasures, and all that he had in his stores: and there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, which Ezekias did not show.  <span class="verse" rel="v02339  003" id="39  003" >3</span>
 And Esaias the prophet came to king Ezekias, and said to him, What say these men? and whence came they to you? and Ezekias said, They are come to me from a land afar off, from Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02339  004" id="39  004" >4</span>
 And Esaias said, What have they seen in your house? and Ezekias said, They have seen everything in my house; and there is nothing in my house which they have not seen: yes, also the   possessions   in my treasuries.  <span class="verse" rel="v02339  005" id="39  005" >5</span>
 And Esaias said to him, Hear the word of the Lord of hosts:  <span class="verse" rel="v02339  006" id="39  006" >6</span>
 Behold, the days come, when they shall take all the   things that are   in your house, and all that your fathers have gathered until this day, shall go to Babylon; and they shall not leave anything at all: and God has said,  <span class="verse" rel="v02339  007" id="39  007" >7</span>

 And Ezekias said to Esaias, Good is the word of the Lord, which he has spoken: let there, I pray, be peace and righteousness in my days.

 which shall be blessed on the earth; for they shall bless the true God: and they that swear upon the earth shall swear by the true God; for they shall forget the former affliction, it shall not come into their mind.  <span class="verse" rel="v02365  017" id="65  017" >17</span>
 For there shall be a new heaven and a new earth: and they shall not at all remember the former, neither shall they at all come into their mind.  <span class="verse" rel="v02365  018" id="65  018" >18</span>
 But they shall find in her joy and exultation; for, behold, I make Jerusalem a rejoicing, and my people a joy.  <span class="verse" rel="v02365  019" id="65  019" >19</span>
 And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and will be glad in my people: and there shall no more be heard in her the voice of weeping, or the voice of crying.  <span class="verse" rel="v02365  020" id="65  020" >20</span>
 Neither shall there be there any more a   child that dies   untimely, or an old man who shall not complete his time: for the youth shall be a hundred years   old  , and the sinner who dies at a hundred years shall also be accursed:  <span class="verse" rel="v02365  021" id="65  021" >21</span>
 and they shall build houses, and themselves shall dwell in   them  ; and they shall plant vineyards, and themselves shall eat the fruit thereof.  <span class="verse" rel="v02365  022" id="65  022" >22</span>
 They shall by no means build, and others inhabit; and they shall by no means plant, and others eat: for as the days of the tree of life shall be the days of my people, they shall long enjoy the fruits of their labors.  <span class="verse" rel="v02365  023" id="65  023" >23</span>
 My chosen shall not toil in vain, neither shall they beget children to be cursed; for they are a seed blessed of God, and their offspring with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02365  024" id="65  024" >24</span>
 And it shall come to pass,   that   before they call, I will listen to them; while they are yet speaking, I will say, What is it?  <span class="verse" rel="v02365  025" id="65  025" >25</span>
 Then wolves and lambs shall feed together, and the lion shall eat chaff like the ox, and the serpent earth as bread. They shall not injure nor destroy in my holy mountain, says the Lord.

<p><span class="chapter" id="66  001">66  </span> Thus says the Lord,  <span class="xrefmarker">*</span><span class="xref">        Acts 7. 49,50.  </span>  Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what kind of a house will you° build me? and of what kind   is to be   the place of my rest?  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  002" id="66  002" >2</span>
 For all these things are mine, says the Lord: and to whom will I have respect, but to the humble and meek, and the   man   that trembles   at   my words?  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  003" id="66  003" >3</span>
 But the transgressor that sacrifices a calf to me, is as he that kills a dog; and he that offers fine flour, as   one that offers   swine's blood; he that gives frankincense for a memorial, is as a blasphemer. Yet they have chosen their own ways, and their soul has delighted in their abominations.  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  004" id="66  004" >4</span>
 I also will choose their mockeries, and will recompense their sins upon them; because I called them, and they did not listen to me; I spoke, and they heard not: and they did evil before me, and chose the things wherein I delighted not.  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  005" id="66  005" >5</span>
 Hear the words of the Lord, you° that tremble at his word; speak you°,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.   ἡμῶν, but   Heb.   and   Vat.   'your.'  </span>  our brethren, to them that hate you and abominate you, that the name of the Lord may be glorified, and may appear  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   your.  </span>  their joy; but they shall be ashamed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  006" id="66  006" >6</span>
 A voice of a cry from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord rendering recompence to   his   adversaries.  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  007" id="66  007" >7</span>
 Before she that travailed brought forth, before the travail-pain came on, she escaped   it   and brought forth a male.  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  008" id="66  008" >8</span>
 Who has heard such a thing? and who has seen after this manner? Has the earth travailed in one day? or has even a nation been born at once, that Sion has travailed, and brought forth her children?  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  009" id="66  009" >9</span>
 But I have raised this expectation, yet you have not remembered me, says the Lord: behold, have not I made the bearing and barren woman? says your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  010" id="66  010" >10</span>
 Rejoice, O Jerusalem, and all you° that love her hold in her a general assembly: rejoice greatly with her, all that   now   mourn over her:  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  011" id="66  011" >11</span>
 that you° may suck, and be satisfied with the breast of her consolation; that you° may milk out, and delight yourselves with the influx of her glory.  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  012" id="66  012" >12</span>
 For thus says the Lord, Behold, I  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        i.e.   turn myself.  </span>  turn toward them as a river of peace, and as a torrent bringing upon them in a flood the glory of the Gentiles: their children shall be borne upon the shoulders, and comforted on the knees.  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  013" id="66  013" >13</span>
 As if his mother should comfort one, so will I also comfort you; and you° shall be comforted in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  014" id="66  014" >14</span>
 And you° shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   spring up.  </span>  thrive like grass: and the hand of the Lord shall be known to them that fear him, and he shall threaten the disobedient.  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  015" id="66  015" >15</span>
 For, behold, the Lord will come as fire, and his chariots as a storm, to render his vengeance with wrath, and his rebuke with a flame of fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  016" id="66  016" >16</span>
 For with the fire of the Lord all the earth shall be judged, and all flesh with his sword: many shall be slain by the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  017" id="66  017" >17</span>
 They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens, and eat swine's flesh in the porches, and the abominations, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  018" id="66  018" >18</span>
 And I   know   their works and their imagination. I am going to gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  019" id="66  019" >19</span>
 And I will leave a sign upon them, and I will send forth them that have escaped of them to the nations, to Tharsis, and Phud, and Lud, and Mosoch, and to Thobel, and to Greece, and to the isles afar off, to those who have not heard my name, nor seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  020" id="66  020" >20</span>
 And they shall bring your brethren out of all nations for a gift to the Lord with horses, and chariots, in litters   drawn by   mules with awnings, to the holy city Jerusalem, said the Lord, as though the children of Israel should bring their sacrifices to me with psalms into the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  021" id="66  021" >21</span>
 And I will take of them priests and Levites, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  022" id="66  022" >22</span>
 For as the new heaven and the new earth, which I make, remain before me, says the Lord, so shall your seed and your name continue.  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  023" id="66  023" >23</span>
 And it shall come to pass from month to month, and from sabbath to sabbath,   that   all flesh shall come to worship before me in Jerusalem, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02366  024" id="66  024" >24</span>
 And they shall go forth, and see the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched; and they shall be a spectacle to all flesh.
