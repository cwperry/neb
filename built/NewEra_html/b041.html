<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the twelfth year of the reign of Nabuchodonosor, who reigned in Nineve, the great city; in the days of Arphaxad, which reigned over the Medes in Ecbatane,  <span class="verse" rel="v0411  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 And built in Ecbatane walls round about of stones hewn three cubits broad and six cubits long, and made the height of the wall seventy cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits:  <span class="verse" rel="v0411  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 And set the towers thereof upon the gates of it an hundred cubits high, and the breadth thereof in the foundation threescore cubits:  <span class="verse" rel="v0411  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And he made the gates thereof, even gates that were raised to the height of seventy cubits, and the breadth of them was forty cubits, for the going forth of his mighty armies, and for the setting in array of his footmen:  <span class="verse" rel="v0411  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 Even in those days king Nabuchodonosor made war with king Arphaxad in the great plain, which is the plain in the borders of Ragau.  <span class="verse" rel="v0411  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 And there came to him all they that lived in the hill country, and all that lived by Euphrates, and Tigris and Hydaspes, and the plain of Arioch the king of the Elymeans, and very many nations of the sons of Chelod, assembled themselves to the battle.  <span class="verse" rel="v0411  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 Then Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians sent to all that lived in Persia, and to all that lived westward, and to those that lived in Cilicia, and Damascus, and Libanus, and Antilibanus, and to all that lived upon the sea coast,  <span class="verse" rel="v0411  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 And to those among the nations that were of Carmel, and Galaad, and the higher Galilee, and the great plain of Esdrelom,  <span class="verse" rel="v0411  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 And to all that were in Samaria and the cities thereof, and beyond Jordan to Jerusalem, and Betane, and Chelus, and Kades, and the river of Egypt, and Taphnes, and Ramesse, and all the land of Gesem,  <span class="verse" rel="v0411  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 Until you° come beyond Tanis and Memphis, and to all the inhabitants of Egypt, until you° come to the borders of Ethiopia.  <span class="verse" rel="v0411  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 But all the inhabitants of the land made light of the commandment of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, neither they went with him to the battle; for they were not afraid of him: yes, he was before them as one man, and they sent away his ambassadors from them without effect, and with disgrace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0411  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 Therefore Nabuchodonosor was very angry with all this country, and sware by his throne and kingdom, that he would surely be avenged upon all those coasts of Cilicia, and Damascus, and Syria, and that he would kill with the sword all the inhabitants of the land of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and all Judea, and all that were in Egypt, till you° come to the borders of the two seas.  <span class="verse" rel="v0411  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 Then he marched in battle array with his power against king Arphaxad in the seventeenth year, and he prevailed in his battle: for he overthrew all the power of Arphaxad, and all his horsemen, and all his chariots,  <span class="verse" rel="v0411  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 And became lord of his cities, and came to Ecbatane, and took the towers, and spoiled the streets thereof, and turned the beauty thereof into shame.  <span class="verse" rel="v0411  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 He took also Arphaxad in the mountains of Ragau, and struck him through with his darts, and destroyed him utterly that day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0411  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 So he returned afterward to Nineve, both he and all his company of sundry nations being a very great multitude of men of war, and there he took his ease, and banqueted, both he and his army, an hundred and twenty days.  
<!-- 2   016 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> And in the eighteenth year, the two and twentieth day of the first month, there was talk in the house of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians that he should, as he said, avenge himself on all the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 So he called to him all his officers, and all his nobles, and communicated with them his secret counsel, and concluded the afflicting of the whole earth out of his own mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 Then they decreed to destroy all flesh, that did not obey the commandment of his mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 And when he had ended his counsel, Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians called Holofernes the chief captain of his army, which was next to him, and said to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 Thus says the great king, the lord of the whole earth, Behold, you shall go forth from my presence, and take with you men that trust in their own strength, of footmen an hundred and twenty thousand; and the number of horses with their riders twelve thousand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 And you shall go against all the west country, because they disobeyed my commandment.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 And you shall declare to that they prepare for me earth and water: for I will go forth in my wrath against them and will cover the whole face of the earth with the feet of my army, and I will give them for a spoil to them:  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 So that their slain shall fill their valleys and brooks and the river shall be filled with their dead, till it overflow:  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 And I will lead them captives to the utmost parts of all the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 You therefore shall go forth. and take beforehand for me all their coasts: and if they will yield themselves to you, you shall reserve them for me till the day of their punishment.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 But concerning them that rebel, let not your eye spare them; but put them to the slaughter, and spoil them wherever you go.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 For as I live, and by the power of my kingdom, whatever I have spoken, that will I do by my hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 And take you heed that you transgress none of the commandments of your lord, but accomplish them fully, as I have commanded you, and defer not to do them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 Then Holofernes went forth from the presence of his lord, and called all the governors and captains, and the officers of the army of Assur;  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 And he mustered the chosen men for the battle, as his lord had commanded him, to an hundred and twenty thousand, and twelve thousand archers on horseback;  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 And he ranged them, as a great army is ordered for the war.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 And he took camels and asses for their carriages, a very great number; and sheep and oxen and goats without number for their provision:  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 And plenty of victual for every man of the army, and very much gold and silver out of the king's house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 Then he went forth and all his power to go before king Nabuchodonosor in the voyage, and to cover all the face of the earth westward with their chariots, and horsemen, and their chosen footmen.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 A great number also sundry countries came with them like locusts, and like the sand of the earth: for the multitude was without number.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 And they went forth of Nineve three days' journey toward the plain of Bectileth, and pitched from Bectileth near the mountain which is at the left hand of the upper Cilicia.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 Then he took all his army, his footmen, and horsemen and chariots, and went from thence into the hill country;  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  023" id="2  023" >23</span>
 And destroyed Phud and Lud, and spoiled all the children of Rasses, and the children of Israel, which were toward the wilderness at the south of the land of the Chellians.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  024" id="2  024" >24</span>
 Then he went over Euphrates, and went through Mesopotamia, and destroyed all the high cities that were upon the river Arbonai, till you° come to the sea.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  025" id="2  025" >25</span>
 And he took the borders of Cilicia, and killed all that resisted him, and came to the borders of Japheth, which were toward the south, over against Arabia.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  026" id="2  026" >26</span>
 He compassed also all the children of Madian, and burned up their tabernacles, and spoiled their sheepcotes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  027" id="2  027" >27</span>
 Then he went down into the plain of Damascus in the time of wheat harvest, and burnt up all their fields, and destroyed their flocks and herds, also he spoiled their cities, and utterly wasted their countries, and struck all their young men with the edge of the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v0412  028" id="2  028" >28</span>
 Therefore the fear and dread of him fell upon all the inhabitants of the sea coasts, which were in Sidon and Tyrus, and them that lived in Sur and Ocina, and all that lived in Jemnaan; and they that lived in Azotus and Ascalon feared him greatly.  
<!-- 3   028 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> So they sent ambassadors to him to treat of peace, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0413  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 Behold, we the servants of Nabuchodonosor the great king lie before you; use us as shall be good in your sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v0413  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 Behold, our houses, and all our places, and all our fields of wheat, and flocks, and herds, and all the lodges of our tents lie before your face; use them as it pleases you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0413  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 Behold, even our cities and the inhabitants thereof are your servants; come and deal with them as seems good to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0413  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 So the men came to Holofernes, and declared to him after this manner.  <span class="verse" rel="v0413  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 Then came he down toward the sea coast, both he and his army, and set garrisons in the high cities, and took out of them chosen men for aid.  <span class="verse" rel="v0413  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 So they and all the country round about received them with garlands, with dances, and with timbrels.  <span class="verse" rel="v0413  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 Yet he did cast down their frontiers, and cut down their groves: for he had decreed to destroy all the gods of the land, that all nations should worship Nabuchodonosor only, and that all tongues and tribes should call upon him as god.  <span class="verse" rel="v0413  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 Also he came over against Esdraelon near to Judea, over against the great strait of Judea.  <span class="verse" rel="v0413  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 And he pitched between Geba and Scythopolis, and there he tarried a whole month, that he might gather together all the carriages of his army.  
<!-- 4   010 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> Now the children of Israel, that lived in Judea, heard all that Holofernes the chief captain of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians had done to the nations, and after what manner he had spoiled all their temples, and brought them to nothing.  <span class="verse" rel="v0414  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 Therefore they were exceedingly afraid of him, and were troubled for Jerusalem, and for the temple of the Lord their God:  <span class="verse" rel="v0414  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 For they were newly returned from the captivity, and all the people of Judea were lately gathered together: and the vessels, and the altar, and the house, were sanctified after the profanation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0414  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 Therefore they sent into all the coasts of Samaria, and the villages and to Bethoron, and Belmen, and Jericho, and to Choba, and Esora, and to the valley of Salem:  <span class="verse" rel="v0414  005" id="4  005" >5</span>
 And possessed themselves beforehand of all the tops of the high mountains, and fortified the villages that were in them, and laid up food for the provision of war: for their fields were of late reaped.  <span class="verse" rel="v0414  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 Also Joacim the high priest, which was in those days in Jerusalem, wrote to them that lived in Bethulia, and Betomestham, which is over against Esdraelon toward the open country, near to Dothaim,  <span class="verse" rel="v0414  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 Charging them to keep the passages of the hill country: for by them there was an entrance into Judea, and it was easy to stop them that would come up, because the passage was straight, for two men at the most.  <span class="verse" rel="v0414  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 And the children of Israel did as Joacim the high priest had commanded them, with the ancients of all the people of Israel, which lived at Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0414  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 Then every man of Israel cried to God with great fervency, and with great vehemency did they humble their souls:  <span class="verse" rel="v0414  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 Both they, and their wives and their children, and their cattle, and every stranger and hireling, and their servants bought with money, put sackcloth upon their loins.  <span class="verse" rel="v0414  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 Thus every man and women, and the little children, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, fell before the temple, and cast ashes upon their heads, and spread out their sackcloth before the face of the Lord: also they put sackcloth about the altar,  <span class="verse" rel="v0414  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 And cried to the God of Israel all with one consent earnestly, that he would not give their children for a prey, and their wives for a spoil, and the cities of their inheritance to destruction, and the sanctuary to profanation and reproach, and for the nations to rejoice at.  <span class="verse" rel="v0414  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 So God heard their prayers, and looked upon their afflictions: for the people fasted many days in all Judea and Jerusalem before the sanctuary of the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0414  014" id="4  014" >14</span>
 And Joacim the high priest, and all the priests that stood before the Lord, and they which ministered to the Lord, had their loins girded with sackcloth, and offered the daily burnt offerings, with the vows and free gifts of the people,  <span class="verse" rel="v0414  015" id="4  015" >15</span>
 And had ashes on their mitres, and cried to the Lord with all their power, that he would look upon all the house of Israel graciously.  
<!-- 5   015 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> Then was it declared to Holofernes, the chief captain of the army of Assur, that the children of Israel had prepared for war, and had shut up the passages of the hill country, and had fortified all the tops of the high hills and had laid impediments in the champaign countries:  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 Wherewith he was very angry, and called all the princes of Moab, and the captains of Ammon, and all the governors of the sea coast,  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 And he said to them, Tell me now, you° sons of Chanaan, who this people is, that dwells in the hill country, and what are the cities that they inhabit, and what is the multitude of their army, and wherein is their power and strength, and what king is set over them, or captain of their army;  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 And why have they determined not to come and meet me, more than all the inhabitants of the west.  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 Then said Achior, the captain of all the sons of Ammon, Let my lord now hear a word from the mouth of your servant, and I will declare to you the truth concerning this people, which dwells near you, and inhabits the hill countries: and there shall no lie come out of the mouth of your servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 This people are descended of the Chaldeans:  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 And they sojourned heretofore in Mesopotamia, because they would not follow the gods of their fathers, which were in the land of Chaldea.  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 For they left the way of their ancestors, and worshipped the God of heaven, the God whom they knew: so they cast them out from the face of their gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia, and sojourned there many days.  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 Then their God commanded them to depart from the place where they sojourned, and to go into the land of Chanaan: where they lived, and were increased with gold and silver, and with very much cattle.  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 But when a famine covered all the land of Chanaan, they went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, while they were nourished, and became there a great multitude, so that one could not number their nation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  011" id="5  011" >11</span>
 Therefore the king of Egypt rose up against them, and dealt subtly with them, and brought them low with laboring in brick, and made them slaves.  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  012" id="5  012" >12</span>
 Then they cried to their God, and he struck all the land of Egypt with incurable plagues: so the Egyptians cast them out of their sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  013" id="5  013" >13</span>
 And God dried the Red sea before them,  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 And brought them to mount Sina, and Cades-Barne, and cast forth all that lived in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  015" id="5  015" >15</span>
 So they lived in the land of the Amorites, and they destroyed by their strength all them of Esebon, and passing over Jordan they possessed all the hill country.  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  016" id="5  016" >16</span>
 And they cast forth before them the Chanaanite, the Pherezite, the Jebusite, and the Sychemite, and all the Gergesites, and they lived in that country many days.  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  017" id="5  017" >17</span>
 And while they sinned not before their God, they prospered, because the God that hates iniquity was with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  018" id="5  018" >18</span>
 But when they departed from the way which he appointed them, they were destroyed in many battles very sore, and were led captives into a land that was not their's, and the temple of their God was cast to the ground, and their cities were taken by the enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  019" id="5  019" >19</span>
 But now are they returned to their God, and are come up from the places where they were scattered, and have possessed Jerusalem, where their sanctuary is, and are seated in the hill country; for it was desolate.  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  020" id="5  020" >20</span>
 Now therefore, my lord and governor, if there be any error against this people, and they sin against their God, let us consider that this shall be their ruin, and let us go up, and we shall overcome them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  021" id="5  021" >21</span>
 But if there be no iniquity in their nation, let my lord now pass by, lest their Lord defend them, and their God be for them, and we become a reproach before all the world.  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  022" id="5  022" >22</span>
 And when Achior had finished these sayings, all the people standing round about the tent murmured, and the chief men of Holofernes, and all that lived by the sea side, and in Moab, spoke that he should kill him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  023" id="5  023" >23</span>
 For, say they, we will not be afraid of the face of the children of Israel: for, behold, it is a people that have no strength nor power for a strong battle  <span class="verse" rel="v0415  024" id="5  024" >24</span>
 Now therefore, lord Holofernes, we will go up, and they shall be a prey to be devoured of all your army.  
<!-- 6   024 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="6  001">6  </span> And when the tumult of men that were about the council was ceased, Holofernes the chief captain of the army of Assur said to Achior and all the Moabites before all the company of other nations,  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  002" id="6  002" >2</span>
 And who are you, Achior, and the hirelings of Ephraim, that you have prophesied against us as to day, and have said, that we should not make war with the people of Israel, because their God will defend them? and who is God but Nabuchodonosor?  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  003" id="6  003" >3</span>
 He will send his power, and will destroy them from the face of the earth, and their God shall not deliver them: but we his servants will destroy them as one man; for they are not able to sustain the power of our horses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  004" id="6  004" >4</span>
 For with them we will tread them under foot, and their mountains shall be drunken with their blood, and their fields shall be filled with their dead bodies, and their footsteps shall not be able to stand before us, for they shall utterly perish, says king Nabuchodonosor, lord of all the earth: for he said, None of my words shall be in vain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  005" id="6  005" >5</span>
 And you, Achior, an hireling of Ammon, which have spoken these words in the day of your iniquity, shall see my face no more from this day, until I take vengeance of this nation that came out of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  006" id="6  006" >6</span>
 And then shall the sword of my army, and the multitude of them that serve me, pass through your sides, and you shall fall among their slain, when I return.  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  007" id="6  007" >7</span>
 Now therefore my servants shall bring you back into the hill country, and shall set you in one of the cities of the passages:  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  008" id="6  008" >8</span>
 And you shall not perish, till you be destroyed with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  009" id="6  009" >9</span>
 And if you persuade yourself in your mind that they shall be taken, let not your countenance fall: I have spoken it, and none of my words shall be in vain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  010" id="6  010" >10</span>
 Then Holofernes commanded his servants, that waited in his tent, to take Achior, and bring him to Bethulia, and deliver him into the hands of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  011" id="6  011" >11</span>
 So his servants took him, and brought him out of the camp into the plain, and they went from the midst of the plain into the hill country, and came to the fountains that were under Bethulia.  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  012" id="6  012" >12</span>
 And when the men of the city saw them, they took up their weapons, and went out of the city to the top of the hill: and every man that used a sling kept them from coming up by casting of stones against them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  013" id="6  013" >13</span>
 Nevertheless having gotten privily under the hill, they bound Achior, and cast him down, and left him at the foot of the hill, and returned to their lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  014" id="6  014" >14</span>
 But the Israelites descended from their city, and came to him, and loosed him, and brought him to Bethulia, and presented him to the governors of the city:  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  015" id="6  015" >15</span>
 Which were in those days Ozias the son of Micha, of the tribe of Simeon, and Chabris the son of Gothoniel, and Charmis the son of Melchiel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  016" id="6  016" >16</span>
 And they called together all the ancients of the city, and all their youth ran together, and their women, to the assembly, and they set Achior in the midst of all their people. Then Ozias asked him of that which was done.  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  017" id="6  017" >17</span>
 And he answered and declared to them the words of the council of Holofernes, and all the words that he had spoken in the midst of the princes of Assur, and whatever Holofernes had spoken proudly against the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  018" id="6  018" >18</span>
 Then the people fell down and worshipped God, and cried to God. saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  019" id="6  019" >19</span>
 O Lord God of heaven, behold their pride, and pity the low estate of our nation, and look upon the face of those that are sanctified to you this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  020" id="6  020" >20</span>
 Then they comforted Achior, and praised him greatly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0416  021" id="6  021" >21</span>
 And Ozias took him out of the assembly to his house, and made a feast to the elders; and they called on the God of Israel all that night for help.  
<!-- 7   021 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="7  001">7  </span> The next day Holofernes commanded all his army, and all his people which were come to take his part, that they should remove their camp against Bethulia, to take beforehand the ascents of the hill country, and to make war against the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  002" id="7  002" >2</span>
 Then their strong men removed their camps in that day, and the army of the men of war was an hundred and seventy thousand footmen, and twelve thousand horsemen, beside the baggage, and other men that were afoot among them, a very great multitude.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  003" id="7  003" >3</span>
 And they camped in the valley near to Bethulia, by the fountain, and they spread themselves in breadth over Dothaim even to Belmaim, and in length from Bethulia to Cynamon, which is over against Esdraelon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  004" id="7  004" >4</span>
 Now the children of Israel, when they saw the multitude of them, were greatly troubled, and said every one to his neighbor, Now will these men lick up the face of the earth; for neither the high mountains, nor the valleys, nor the hills, are able to bear their weight.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  005" id="7  005" >5</span>
 Then every man took up his weapons of war, and when they had kindled fires upon their towers, they remained and watched all that night.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  006" id="7  006" >6</span>
 But in the second day Holofernes brought forth all his horsemen in the sight of the children of Israel which were in Bethulia,  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  007" id="7  007" >7</span>
 And viewed the passages up to the city, and came to the fountains of their waters, and took them, and set garrisons of men of war over them, and he himself removed toward his people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  008" id="7  008" >8</span>
 Then came to him all the chief of the children of Esau, and all the governors of the people of Moab, and the captains of the sea coast, and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  009" id="7  009" >9</span>
 Let our lord now hear a word, that there be not an overthrow in your army.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  010" id="7  010" >10</span>
 For this people of the children of Israel do not trust in their spears, but in the height of the mountains wherein they dwell, because it is not easy to come up to the tops of their mountains.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  011" id="7  011" >11</span>
 Now therefore, my lord, fight not against them in battle array, and there shall not so much as one man of your people perish.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  012" id="7  012" >12</span>
 Remain in your camp, and keep all the men of your army, and let your servants get into their hands the fountain of water, which issues forth of the foot of the mountain:  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  013" id="7  013" >13</span>
 For all the inhabitants of Bethulia have their water thence; so shall thirst kill them, and they shall give up their city, and we and our people shall go up to the tops of the mountains that are near, and will camp upon them, to watch that none go out of the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  014" id="7  014" >14</span>
 So they and their wives and their children shall be consumed with fire, and before the sword come against them, they shall be overthrown in the streets where they dwell.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  015" id="7  015" >15</span>
 Thus shall you render them an evil reward; because they rebelled, and met not your person peaceably.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  016" id="7  016" >16</span>
 And these words pleased Holofernes and all his servants, and he appointed to do as they had spoken.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  017" id="7  017" >17</span>
 So the camp of the children of Ammon departed, and with them five thousand of the Assyrians, and they pitched in the valley, and took the waters, and the fountains of the waters of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  018" id="7  018" >18</span>
 Then the children of Esau went up with the children of Ammon, and camped in the hill country over against Dothaim: and they sent some of them toward the south, and toward the east over against Ekrebel, which is near to Chusi, that is upon the brook Mochmur; and the rest of the army of the Assyrians camped in the plain, and covered the face of the whole land; and their tents and carriages were pitched to a very great multitude.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  019" id="7  019" >19</span>
 Then the children of Israel cried to the Lord their God, because their heart failed, for all their enemies had compassed them round about, and there was no way to escape out from among them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  020" id="7  020" >20</span>
 Thus all the company of Assur remained about them, both their footmen, chariots, and horsemen, four and thirty days, so that all their vessels of water failed all the inhibitants of Bethulia.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  021" id="7  021" >21</span>
 And the cisterns were emptied, and they had not water to drink their fill for one day; for they gave them drink by measure.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  022" id="7  022" >22</span>
 Therefore their young children were out of heart, and their women and young men fainted for thirst, and fell down in the streets of the city, and by the passages of the gates, and there was no longer any strength in them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  023" id="7  023" >23</span>
 Then all the people assembled to Ozias, and to the chief of the city, both young men, and women, and children, and cried with a loud voice, and said before all the elders,  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  024" id="7  024" >24</span>
 God be judge between us and you: for you° have done us great injury, in that you° have not required peace of the children of Assur.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  025" id="7  025" >25</span>
 For now we have no helper: but God has sold us into their hands, that we should be thrown down before them with thirst and great destruction.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  026" id="7  026" >26</span>
 Now therefore call them to you, and deliver the whole city for a spoil to the people of Holofernes, and to all his army.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  027" id="7  027" >27</span>
 For it is better for us to be made a spoil to them, than to die for thirst: for we will be his servants, that our souls may live, and not see the death of our infants before our eyes, nor our wives nor our children to die.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  028" id="7  028" >28</span>
 We take to witness against you the heaven and the earth, and our God and Lord of our fathers, which punishes us according to our sins and the sins of our fathers, that he do not according as we have said this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  029" id="7  029" >29</span>
 Then there was great weeping with one consent in the midst of the assembly; and they cried to the Lord God with a loud voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  030" id="7  030" >30</span>
 Then said Ozias to them, Brethren, be of good courage, let us yet endure five days, in the which space the Lord our God may turn his mercy toward us; for he will not forsake us utterly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  031" id="7  031" >31</span>
 And if these days pass, and there come no help to us, I will do according to your word.  <span class="verse" rel="v0417  032" id="7  032" >32</span>
 And he dispersed the people, every one to their own charge; and they went to the walls and towers of their city, and sent the women and children into their houses: and they were very low brought in the city.  
<!-- 8   032 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> Now at that time Judith heard thereof, which was the daughter of Merari, the son of Ox, the son of Joseph, the son of Ozel, the son of Elcia, the son of Ananias, the son of Gedeon, the son of Raphaim, the son of Acitho, the son of Eliu, the son of Eliab, the son of Nathanael, the son of Samael, the son of Salasadal, the son of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 And Manasses was her husband, of her tribe and kindred, who died in the barley harvest.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 For as he stood overseeing them that bound sheaves in the field, the heat came upon his head, and he fell on his bed, and died in the city of Bethulia: and they buried him with his fathers in the field between Dothaim and Balamo.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  004" id="8  004" >4</span>
 So Judith was a widow in her house three years and four months.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 And she made her a tent upon the top of her house, and put on sackcloth upon her loins and ware her widow's apparel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 And she fasted all the days of her widowhood, save the eves of the sabbaths, and the sabbaths, and the eves of the new moons, and the new moons and the feasts and solemn days of the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  007" id="8  007" >7</span>
 She was also of a goodly countenance, and very beautiful to behold: and her husband Manasses had left her gold, and silver, and menservants and maidservants, and cattle, and lands; and she remained upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  008" id="8  008" >8</span>
 And there was none that gave her an ill word; for she feared God greatly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 Now when she heard the evil words of the people against the governor, that they fainted for lack of water; for Judith had heard all the words that Ozias had spoken to them, and that he had sworn to deliver the city to the Assyrians after five days;  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 Then she sent her waitingwoman, that had the government of all things that she had, to call Ozias and Chabris and Charmis, the ancients of the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  011" id="8  011" >11</span>
 And they came to her, and she said to them, Hear me now, O you° governors of the inhabitants of Bethulia: for your words that you° have spoken before the people this day are not right, touching this oath which you° made and pronounced between God and you, and have promised to deliver the city to our enemies, unless within these days the Lord turn to help you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  012" id="8  012" >12</span>
 And now who are you° that have tempted God this day, and stand instead of God among the children of men?  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 And now try the Lord Almighty, but you° shall never know any thing.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 For you° can’t find the depth of the heart of man, neither can you° perceive the things that he thinks: then how can you° search out God, that has made all these things, and know his mind, or comprehend his purpose? Nay, my brethren, provoke not the Lord our God to anger.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  015" id="8  015" >15</span>
 For if he will not help us within these five days, he has power to defend us when he will, even every day, or to destroy us before our enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  016" id="8  016" >16</span>
 Do not bind the counsels of the Lord our God: for God is not as man, that he may be threatened; neither is he as the son of man, that he should be wavering.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  017" id="8  017" >17</span>
 Therefore let us wait for salvation of him, and call upon him to help us, and he will hear our voice, if it please him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  018" id="8  018" >18</span>
 For there arose none in our age, neither is there any now in these days neither tribe, nor family, nor people, nor city among us, which worship gods made with hands, as has been aforetime.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  019" id="8  019" >19</span>
 For the which cause our fathers were given to the sword, and for a spoil, and had a great fall before our enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  020" id="8  020" >20</span>
 But we know none other god, therefore we trust that he will not dispise us, nor any of our nation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  021" id="8  021" >21</span>
 For if we be taken so, all Judea shall lie waste, and our sanctuary shall be spoiled; and he will require the profanation thereof at our mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  022" id="8  022" >22</span>
 And the slaughter of our brethren, and the captivity of the country, and the desolation of our inheritance, will he turn upon our heads among the Gentiles, wherever we shall be in bondage; and we shall be an offense and a reproach to all them that possess us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  023" id="8  023" >23</span>
 For our servitude shall not be directed to favor: but the Lord our God shall turn it to dishonor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  024" id="8  024" >24</span>
 Now therefore, O brethren, let us show an example to our brethren, because their hearts depend upon us, and the sanctuary, and the house, and the altar, rest upon us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  025" id="8  025" >25</span>
 Moreover let us give thanks to the Lord our God, which tries us, even as he did our fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  026" id="8  026" >26</span>
 Remember what things he did to Abraham, and how he tried Isaac, and what happened to Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria, when he kept the sheep of Laban his mother's brother.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  027" id="8  027" >27</span>
 For he has not tried us in the fire, as he did them, for the examination of their hearts, neither has he taken vengeance on us: but the Lord does scourge them that come near to him, to admonish them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  028" id="8  028" >28</span>
 Then said Ozias to her, All that you have spoken have you spoken with a good heart, and there is none that may gainsay your words.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  029" id="8  029" >29</span>
 For this is not the first day wherein your wisdom is manifested; but from the beginning of your days all the people have known your understanding, because the disposition of your heart is good.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  030" id="8  030" >30</span>
 But the people were very thirsty, and compelled us to do to them as we have spoken, and to bring an oath upon ourselves, which we will not break.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  031" id="8  031" >31</span>
 Therefore now pray you for us, because you are a godly woman, and the Lord will send us rain to fill our cisterns, and we shall faint no more.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  032" id="8  032" >32</span>
 Then said Judith to them, Hear me, and I will do a thing, which shall go throughout all generations to the children of our nation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  033" id="8  033" >33</span>
 You° shall stand this night in the gate, and I will go forth with my waitingwoman: and within the days that you° have promised to deliver the city to our enemies the Lord will visit Israel by my hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  034" id="8  034" >34</span>
 But enquire not you° of my act: for I will not declare it to you, till the things be finished that I do.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  035" id="8  035" >35</span>
 Then said Ozias and the princes to her, Go in peace, and the Lord God be before you, to take vengeance on our enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0418  036" id="8  036" >36</span>
 So they returned from the tent, and went to their wards.

<p><span class="chapter" id="9  001">9  </span> Judith fell upon her face, and put ashes upon her head, and uncovered the sackcloth wherewith she was clothed; and about the time that the incense of that evening was offered in Jerusalem in the house of the Lord Judith cried with a loud voice, and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v0419  002" id="9  002" >2</span>
 O Lord God of my father Simeon, to whom you gave a sword to take vengeance of the strangers, who loosened the girdle of a maid to defile her, and discovered the thigh to her shame, and polluted her virginity to her reproach; for you said, It shall not be so; and yet they did so:  <span class="verse" rel="v0419  003" id="9  003" >3</span>
 Therefore you gave their rulers to be slain, so that they dyed their bed in blood, being deceived, and struck the servants with their lords, and the lords upon their thrones;  <span class="verse" rel="v0419  004" id="9  004" >4</span>
 And have given their wives for a prey, and their daughters to be captives, and all their spoils to be divided among your dear children; which were moved with your zeal, and abhorred the pollution of their blood, and called upon you for aid: O God, O my God, hear me also a widow.  <span class="verse" rel="v0419  005" id="9  005" >5</span>
 For you have wrought not only those things, but also the things which fell out before, and which ensued after; you have thought upon the things which are now, and which are to come.  <span class="verse" rel="v0419  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
 Yes, what things you did determine were ready at hand, and said, Behold, we are here: for all your ways are prepared, and your judgments are in your foreknowledge.  <span class="verse" rel="v0419  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 For, behold, the Assyrians are multiplied in their power; they are exalted with horse and man; they glory in the strength of their footmen; they trust in shield, and spear, and bow, and sling; and know not that you are the Lord that break the battles: the Lord is your name.  <span class="verse" rel="v0419  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 Throw down their strength in your power, and bring down their force in your wrath: for they have purposed to defile your sanctuary, and to pollute the tabernacle where your glorious name rests and to cast down with sword the horn of your altar.  <span class="verse" rel="v0419  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 Behold their pride, and send your wrath upon their heads: give into my hand, which am a widow, the power that I have conceived.  <span class="verse" rel="v0419  010" id="9  010" >10</span>
 Strike by the deceit of my lips the servant with the prince, and the prince with the servant: break down their stateliness by the hand of a woman.  <span class="verse" rel="v0419  011" id="9  011" >11</span>
 For your power stands not in multitude nor your might in strong men: for you are a God of the afflicted, an helper of the oppressed, an upholder of the weak, a protector of the forlorn, a savior of them that are without hope.  <span class="verse" rel="v0419  012" id="9  012" >12</span>
 I pray you, I pray you, O God of my father, and God of the inheritance of Israel, Lord of the heavens and earth, Creator of the waters, king of every creature, hear you my prayer:  <span class="verse" rel="v0419  013" id="9  013" >13</span>
 And make my speech and deceit to be their wound and stripe, who have purposed cruel things against your covenant, and your hallowed house, and against the top of Sion, and against the house of the possession of your children.  <span class="verse" rel="v0419  014" id="9  014" >14</span>
 And make every nation and tribe to acknowledge that you are the God of all power and might, and that there is none other that protects the people of Israel but you.

<p><span class="chapter" id="10  001">10  </span> Now after that she had ceased to cry to the God of Israel, and bad made an end of all these words.  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  002" id="10  002" >2</span>
 She rose where she had fallen down, and called her maid, and went down into the house in the which she abode in the sabbath days, and in her feast days,  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  003" id="10  003" >3</span>
 And pulled off the sackcloth which she had on, and put off the garments of her widowhood, and washed her body all over with water, and anointed herself with precious ointment, and braided the hair of her head, and put on a tire upon it, and put on her garments of gladness, wherewith she was clad during the life of Manasses her husband.  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  004" id="10  004" >4</span>
 And she took sandals upon her feet, and put about her her bracelets, and her chains, and her rings, and her earrings, and all her ornaments, and decked herself bravely, to allure the eyes of all men that should see her.  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  005" id="10  005" >5</span>
 Then she gave her maid a bottle of wine, and a cruse of oil, and filled a bag with parched corn, and lumps of figs, and with fine bread; so she folded all these things together, and laid them upon her.  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  006" id="10  006" >6</span>
 Thus they went forth to the gate of the city of Bethulia, and found standing there Ozias and the ancients of the city, Chabris and Charmis.  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  007" id="10  007" >7</span>
 And when they saw her, that her countenance was altered, and her apparel was changed, they wondered at her beauty very greatly, and said to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  008" id="10  008" >8</span>
 The God, the God of our fathers give you favor, and accomplish your enterprizes to the glory of the children of Israel, and to the exaltation of Jerusalem. Then they worshipped God.  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  009" id="10  009" >9</span>
 And she said to them, Command the gates of the city to be opened to me, that I may go forth to accomplish the things whereof you° have spoken with me. So they commanded the young men to open to her, as she had spoken.  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  010" id="10  010" >10</span>
 And when they had done so, Judith went out, she, and her maid with her; and the men of the city looked after her, until she was gone down the mountain, and till she had passed the valley, and could see her no more.  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  011" id="10  011" >11</span>
 Thus they went straight forth in the valley: and the first watch of the Assyrians met her,  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  012" id="10  012" >12</span>
 And took her, and asked her, Of what people are you? and whence come you? and whither go you? And she said, I am a woman of the Hebrews, and am fled from them: for they shall be given you to be consumed:  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  013" id="10  013" >13</span>
 And I am coming before Holofernes the chief captain of your army, to declare words of truth; and I will show him a way, whereby he shall go, and win all the hill country, without losing the body or life of any one of his men.  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  014" id="10  014" >14</span>
 Now when the men heard her words, and [*]saw her countenance, they wondered greatly at her beauty, and said to her,  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  015" id="10  015" >15</span>
 You have saved your life, in that you have hasted to come down to the presence of our lord: now therefore come to his tent, and some of us shall conduct you, until they have delivered you to his hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  016" id="10  016" >16</span>
 And when you stand before him, be not afraid in your heart, but show to him according to your word; and he will entreat you well.  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  017" id="10  017" >17</span>
 Then they chose out of them an hundred men to accompany her and her maid; and they brought her to the tent of Holofernes.  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  018" id="10  018" >18</span>
 Then was there a concourse throughout all the camp: for her coming was noised among the tents, and they came about her, as she stood without the tent of Holofernes, till they told him of her.  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  019" id="10  019" >19</span>
 And they wondered at her beauty, and admired the children of Israel because of her, and every one said to his neighbor, Who would despise this people, that have among them such women? surely it is not good that one man of them be left who being let go might deceive the whole earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  020" id="10  020" >20</span>
 And they that lay near Holofernes went out, and all his servants and they brought her into the tent.  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  021" id="10  021" >21</span>
 Now Holofernes rested upon his bed under a canopy, which was woven with purple, and gold, and emeralds, and precious stones.  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  022" id="10  022" >22</span>
 So they showed him of her; and he came out before his tent with silver lamps going before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04110  023" id="10  023" >23</span>
 And when Judith was come before him and his servants they all marveled at the beauty of her countenance; and she fell down upon her face, and did reverence to him: and his servants took her up.  
<!-- 11   023 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="11  001">11  </span> Then said Holofernes to her, Woman, be of good comfort, fear not in your heart: for I never hurt any that was willing to serve Nabuchodonosor, the king of all the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  002" id="11  002" >2</span>
 Now therefore, if your people that dwells in the mountains had not set light by me, I would not have lifted up my spear against them: but they have done these things to themselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  003" id="11  003" >3</span>
 But now tell me therefore you are fled from them, and are come to us: for you are come for safeguard; be of good comfort, you shall live this night, and hereafter:  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  004" id="11  004" >4</span>
 For none shall hurt you, but entreat you well, as they do the servants of king Nabuchodonosor my lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  005" id="11  005" >5</span>
 Then Judith said to him, Receive the words of your servant, and suffer your handmaid to speak in your presence, and I will declare no lie to my lord this night.  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  006" id="11  006" >6</span>
 And if you will follow the words of your handmaid, God will bring the thing perfectly to pass by you; and my lord shall not fail of his purposes.  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  007" id="11  007" >7</span>
 As Nabuchodonosor king of all the earth lives, and as his power lives, who has sent you for the upholding of every living thing: for not only men shall serve him by you, but also the beasts of the field, and the cattle, and the fowls of the air, shall live by your power under Nabuchodonosor and all his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  008" id="11  008" >8</span>
 For we have heard of your wisdom and your policies, and it is reported in all the earth, that you only are excellent in all the kingdom, and mighty in knowledge, and wonderful in feats of war.  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  009" id="11  009" >9</span>
 Now as concerning the matter, which Achior did speak in your council, we have heard his words; for the men of Bethulia saved him, and he declared to them all that he had spoken to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  010" id="11  010" >10</span>
 Therefore, O lord and governor, reject not his word; but lay it up in your heart, for it is true: for our nation shall not be punished, neither can sword prevail against them, except they sin against their God.  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  011" id="11  011" >11</span>
 And now, that my lord be not defeated and frustrate of his purpose, even death is now fallen upon them, and their sin has overtaken them, wherewith they will provoke their God to anger whenever they shall do that which is not fit to be done:  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  012" id="11  012" >12</span>
 For their food fail them, and all their water is scant, and they have determined to lay hands upon their cattle, and purposed to consume all those things, that God has forbidden them to eat by his laws:  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  013" id="11  013" >13</span>
 And are resolved to spend the first fruits of the the tenths of wine and oil, which they had sanctified, and reserved for the priests that serve in Jerusalem before the face of our God; the which things it is not lawful for any of the people so much as to touch with their hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  014" id="11  014" >14</span>
 For they have sent some to Jerusalem, because they also that dwell there have done the like, to bring them a licence from the senate.  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  015" id="11  015" >15</span>
 Now when they shall bring them word, they will forthwith do it, and they shall be given to you to be destroyed the same day.  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  016" id="11  016" >16</span>
 Therefore I your handmaid, knowing all this, am fled from their presence; and God has sent me to work things with you, whereat all the earth shall be astonished, and whoever shall hear it.  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  017" id="11  017" >17</span>
 For your servant is religious, and serves the God of heaven day and night: now therefore, my lord, I will remain with you, and your servant will go out by night into the valley, and I will pray to God, and he will tell me when they have committed their sins:  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  018" id="11  018" >18</span>
 And I will come and show it to you: then you shall go forth with all your army, and there shall be none of them that shall resist you.  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  019" id="11  019" >19</span>
 And I will lead you through the midst of Judea, until you come before Jerusalem; and I will set your throne in the midst thereof; and you shall drive them as sheep that have no shepherd, and a dog shall not so much as open his mouth at you: for these things were told me according to my foreknowledge, and they were declared to me, and I am sent to tell you.  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  020" id="11  020" >20</span>
 Then her words pleased Holofernes and all his servants; and they marveled at her wisdom, and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  021" id="11  021" >21</span>
 There is not such a woman from one end of the earth to the other, both for beauty of face, and wisdom of words.  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  022" id="11  022" >22</span>
 Likewise Holofernes said to her. God has done well to send you before the people, that strength might be in our hands and destruction upon them that lightly regard my lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v04111  023" id="11  023" >23</span>
 And now you are both beautiful in your countenance, and witty in your words: surely if you do as you have spoken your God shall be my God, and you shall dwell in the house of king Nabuchodonosor, and shall be renowned through the whole earth.  
<!-- 12   023 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="12  001">12  </span> Then he commanded to bring her in where his plate was set; and bade that they should prepare for her of his own meats, and that she should drink of his own wine.  <span class="verse" rel="v04112  002" id="12  002" >2</span>
 And Judith said, I will not eat thereof, lest there be an offense: but provision shall be made for me of the things that I have brought.  <span class="verse" rel="v04112  003" id="12  003" >3</span>
 Then Holofernes said to her, If your provision should fail, how should we give you the like? for there be none with us of your nation.  <span class="verse" rel="v04112  004" id="12  004" >4</span>
 Then said Judith to him As your soul lives, my lord, your handmaid shall not spend those things that I have, before the Lord work by my hand the things that he has determined.  <span class="verse" rel="v04112  005" id="12  005" >5</span>
 Then the servants of Holofernes brought her into the tent, and she slept till midnight, and she arose when it was toward the morning watch,  <span class="verse" rel="v04112  006" id="12  006" >6</span>
 And sent to Holofernes, saving, Let my lord now command that your handmaid may go forth to prayer.  <span class="verse" rel="v04112  007" id="12  007" >7</span>
 Then Holofernes commanded his guard that they should not stay her: thus she abode in the camp three days, and went out in the night into the valley of Bethulia, and washed herself in a fountain of water by the camp.  <span class="verse" rel="v04112  008" id="12  008" >8</span>
 And when she came out, she implored the Lord God of Israel to direct her way to the raising up of the children of her people.  <span class="verse" rel="v04112  009" id="12  009" >9</span>
 So she came in clean, and remained in the tent, until she did eat her meat at evening.  <span class="verse" rel="v04112  010" id="12  010" >10</span>
 And in the fourth day Holofernes made a feast to his own servants only, and called none of the officers to the banquet.  <span class="verse" rel="v04112  011" id="12  011" >11</span>
 Then said he to Bagoas the eunuch, who had charge over all that he had, Go now, and persuade this Hebrew woman which is with you, that she come to us, and eat and drink with us.  <span class="verse" rel="v04112  012" id="12  012" >12</span>
 For, behold, it will be a shame for our person, if we shall let such a woman go, not having had her company; for if we draw her not to us, she will laugh us to scorn.  <span class="verse" rel="v04112  013" id="12  013" >13</span>
 Then went Bagoas from the presence of Holofernes, and came to her, and he said, Let not this fair damsel fear to come to my lord, and to be honored in his presence, and drink wine, and be merry with us and be made this day as one of the daughters of the Assyrians, which serve in the house of Nabuchodonosor.  <span class="verse" rel="v04112  014" id="12  014" >14</span>
 Then said Judith to him, Who am I now, that I should gainsay my lord? surely whatever pleases him I will do speedily, and it shall be my joy to the day of my death.  <span class="verse" rel="v04112  015" id="12  015" >15</span>
 So she arose, and decked herself with her apparel and all her woman's attire, and her maid went and laid soft skins on the ground for her over against Holofernes, which she had received of Bagoas for her daily use, that she might sit and eat upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v04112  016" id="12  016" >16</span>
 Now when Judith came in and sat down, Holofernes his heart was ravished with her, and his mind was moved, and he desired greatly her company; for he waited a time to deceive her, from the day that he had seen her.  <span class="verse" rel="v04112  017" id="12  017" >17</span>
 Then said Holofernes to her, Drink now, and be merry with us.  <span class="verse" rel="v04112  018" id="12  018" >18</span>
 So Judith said, I will drink now, my lord, because my life is magnified in me this day more than all the days since I was born.  <span class="verse" rel="v04112  019" id="12  019" >19</span>
 Then she took and ate and drank before him what her maid had prepared.  <span class="verse" rel="v04112  020" id="12  020" >20</span>
 And Holofernes took great delight in her, and drank more wine than he had drunk at any time in one day since he was born.  
<!-- 13   020 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="13  001">13  </span> Now when the evening was come, his servants made haste to depart, and Bagoas shut his tent without, and dismissed the waiters from the presence of his lord; and they went to their beds: for they were all weary, because the feast had been long.  <span class="verse" rel="v04113  002" id="13  002" >2</span>
 And Judith was left along in the tent, and Holofernes lying along upon his bed: for he was filled with wine.  <span class="verse" rel="v04113  003" id="13  003" >3</span>
 Now Judith had commanded her maid to stand without her bedchamber, and to wait for her. coming forth, as she did daily: for she said she would go forth to her prayers, and she spoke to Bagoas according to the same purpose.  <span class="verse" rel="v04113  004" id="13  004" >4</span>
 So all went forth and none was left in the bedchamber, neither little nor great. Then Judith, standing by his bed, said in her heart, O Lord God of all power, look at this present upon the works of my hands for the exaltation of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v04113  005" id="13  005" >5</span>
 For now is the time to help your inheritance, and to execute your enterprizes to the destruction of the enemies which are risen against us.  <span class="verse" rel="v04113  006" id="13  006" >6</span>
 Then she came to the pillar of the bed, which was at Holofernes' head, and took down his fauchion from thence,  <span class="verse" rel="v04113  007" id="13  007" >7</span>
 And approached to his bed, and took hold of the hair of his head, and said, Strengthen me, O Lord God of Israel, this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v04113  008" id="13  008" >8</span>
 And she struck twice upon his neck with all her might, and she took away his head from him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04113  009" id="13  009" >9</span>
 And tumbled his body down from the bed, and pulled down the canopy from the pillars; and anon after she went forth, and gave Holofernes his head to her maid;  <span class="verse" rel="v04113  010" id="13  010" >10</span>
 And she put it in her bag of meat: so they twain went together according to their custom to prayer: and when they passed the camp, they compassed the valley, and went up the mountain of Bethulia, and came to the gates thereof.  <span class="verse" rel="v04113  011" id="13  011" >11</span>
 Then said Judith afar off, to the watchmen at the gate, Open, open now the gate: God, even our God, is with us, to show his power yet in Jerusalem, and his forces against the enemy, as he has even done this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v04113  012" id="13  012" >12</span>
 Now when the men of her city heard her voice, they made haste to go down to the gate of their city, and they called the elders of the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v04113  013" id="13  013" >13</span>
 And then they ran all together, both small and great, for it was strange to them that she was come: so they opened the gate, and received them, and made a fire for a light, and stood round about them.  <span class="verse" rel="v04113  014" id="13  014" >14</span>
 Then she said to them with a loud voice, Praise, praise God, praise God, I say, for he has not taken away his mercy from the house of Israel, but has destroyed our enemies by my hands this night.  <span class="verse" rel="v04113  015" id="13  015" >15</span>
 So she took the head out of the bag, and showed it, and said to them, behold the head of Holofernes, the chief captain of the army of Assur, and behold the canopy, wherein he did lie in his drunkenness; and the Lord has struck him by the hand of a woman.  <span class="verse" rel="v04113  016" id="13  016" >16</span>
 As the Lord lives, who has kept me in my way that I went, my countenance has deceived him to his destruction, and yet has he not committed sin with me, to defile and shame me.  <span class="verse" rel="v04113  017" id="13  017" >17</span>
 Then all the people were wonderfully astonished, and bowed themselves and worshipped God, and said with one accord, Blessed be you, O our God, which have this day brought to nothing the enemies of your people.  <span class="verse" rel="v04113  018" id="13  018" >18</span>
 Then said Ozias to her, O daughter, blessed are you of the most high God above all the women upon the earth; and blessed be the Lord God, which has created the heavens and the earth, which has directed you to the cutting off of the head of the chief of our enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v04113  019" id="13  019" >19</span>
 For this your confidence shall not depart from the heart of men, which remember the power of God for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v04113  020" id="13  020" >20</span>
 And God turn these things to you for a perpetual praise, to visit you in good things because you have not spared your life for the affliction of our nation, but have revenged our ruin, walking a straight way before our God. And all the people said; So be it, so be it.

<p><span class="chapter" id="14  001">14  </span> Then said Judith to them, Hear me now, my brethren, and take this head, and hang it upon the highest place of your walls.  <span class="verse" rel="v04114  002" id="14  002" >2</span>
 And so soon as the morning shall appear, and the sun shall come forth upon the earth, take you° every one his weapons, and go forth every valiant man out of the city, and set you° a captain over them, as though you° would go down into the field toward the watch of the Assyrians; but go not down.  <span class="verse" rel="v04114  003" id="14  003" >3</span>
 Then they shall take their armor, and shall go into their camp, and raise up the captains of the army of Assur, and shall run to the tent of Holofernes, but shall not find him: then fear shall fall upon them, and they shall flee before your face.  <span class="verse" rel="v04114  004" id="14  004" >4</span>
 So you°, and all that inhabit the coast of Israel, shall pursue them, and overthrow them as they go.  <span class="verse" rel="v04114  005" id="14  005" >5</span>
 But before you° do these things, call me Achior the Ammonite, that he may see and know him that despised the house of Israel, and that sent him to us as it were to his death.  <span class="verse" rel="v04114  006" id="14  006" >6</span>
 Then they called Achior out of the house of Ozias; and when he was come, and saw the head of Holofernes in a man's hand in the assembly of the people, he fell down on his face, and his spirit failed.  <span class="verse" rel="v04114  007" id="14  007" >7</span>
 But when they had recovered him, he fell at Judith's feet, and reverenced her, and said, Blessed are you in all the tabernacles of Juda, and in all nations, which hearing your name shall be astonished.  <span class="verse" rel="v04114  008" id="14  008" >8</span>
 Now therefore tell me all the things that you have done in these days. Then Judith declared to him in the midst of the people all that she had done, from the day that she went forth until that hour she spoke to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v04114  009" id="14  009" >9</span>
 And when she had left off speaking, the people shouted with a loud voice, and made a joyful noise in their city.  <span class="verse" rel="v04114  010" id="14  010" >10</span>
 And when Achior had seen all that the God of Israel had done, he believed in God greatly, and circumcised the flesh of his foreskin, and was joined to the house of Israel to this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v04114  011" id="14  011" >11</span>
 And as soon as the morning arose, they hanged the head of Holofernes upon the wall, and every man took his weapons, and they went forth by bands to the straits of the mountain.  <span class="verse" rel="v04114  012" id="14  012" >12</span>
 But when the Assyrians saw them, they sent to their leaders, which came to their captains and tribunes, and to every one of their rulers.  <span class="verse" rel="v04114  013" id="14  013" >13</span>
 So they came to Holofernes' tent, and said to him that had the charge of all his things, Waken now our lord: for the slaves have been bold to come down against us to battle, that they may be utterly destroyed.  <span class="verse" rel="v04114  014" id="14  014" >14</span>
 Then went in Bagoas, and knocked at the door of the tent; for he thought that he had slept with Judith.  <span class="verse" rel="v04114  015" id="14  015" >15</span>
 But because none answered, he opened it, and went into the bedchamber, and found him cast upon the floor dead, and his head was taken from him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04114  016" id="14  016" >16</span>
 Therefore he cried with a loud voice, with weeping, and sighing, and a mighty cry, and tore his garments.  <span class="verse" rel="v04114  017" id="14  017" >17</span>
 After he went into the tent where Judith lodged: and when he found her not, he leaped out to the people, and cried,  <span class="verse" rel="v04114  018" id="14  018" >18</span>
 These slaves have dealt treacherously; one woman of the Hebrews has brought shame upon the house of king Nabuchodonosor: for, behold, Holofernes lies upon the ground without a head.  <span class="verse" rel="v04114  019" id="14  019" >19</span>
 When the captains of the Assyrians' army heard these words, they tore their coats and their minds were wonderfully troubled, and there was a cry and a very great noise throughout the camp.  
<!-- 15   019 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="15  001">15  </span> And when they that were in the tents heard, they were astonished at the thing that was done.  <span class="verse" rel="v04115  002" id="15  002" >2</span>
 And fear and trembling fell upon them, so that there was no man that dared abide in the sight of his neighbor, but rushing out all together, they fled into every way of the plain, and of the hill country.  <span class="verse" rel="v04115  003" id="15  003" >3</span>
 They also that had camped in the mountains round about Bethulia fled away. Then the children of Israel, every one that was a warrior among them, rushed out upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v04115  004" id="15  004" >4</span>
 Then sent Ozias to Betomasthem, and to Bebai, and Chobai, and Cola and to all the coasts of Israel, such as should tell the things that were done, and that all should rush forth upon their enemies to destroy them.  <span class="verse" rel="v04115  005" id="15  005" >5</span>
 Now when the children of Israel heard it, they all fell upon them with one consent, and killed them to Chobai: likewise also they that came from Jerusalem, and from all the hill country, (for men had told them what things were done in the camp of their enemies) and they that were in Galaad, and in Galilee, chased them with a great slaughter, until they were past Damascus and the borders thereof.  <span class="verse" rel="v04115  006" id="15  006" >6</span>
 And the residue that lived at Bethulia, fell upon the camp of Assur, and spoiled them, and were greatly enriched.  <span class="verse" rel="v04115  007" id="15  007" >7</span>
 And the children of Israel that returned from the slaughter had that which remained; and the villages and the cities, that were in the mountains and in the plain, got many spoils: for the multitude was very great.  <span class="verse" rel="v04115  008" id="15  008" >8</span>
 Then Joacim the high priest, and the ancients of the children of Israel that lived in Jerusalem, came to behold the good things that God had showed to Israel, and to see Judith, and to salute her.  <span class="verse" rel="v04115  009" id="15  009" >9</span>
 And when they came to her, they blessed her with one accord, and said to her, You are the exaltation of Jerusalem, you are the great glory of Israel, you are the great rejoicing of our nation:  <span class="verse" rel="v04115  010" id="15  010" >10</span>
 You have done all these things by your hand: you have done much good to Israel, and God is pleased therewith: blessed be you of the Almighty Lord for evermore. And all the people said, So be it.  <span class="verse" rel="v04115  011" id="15  011" >11</span>
 And the people spoiled the camp the space of thirty days: and they gave to Judith Holofernes his tent, and all his plate, and beds, and vessels, and all his stuff: and she took it and laid it on her mule; and made ready her carts, and laid them thereon.  <span class="verse" rel="v04115  012" id="15  012" >12</span>
 Then all the women of Israel ran together to see her, and blessed her, and made a dance among them for her: and she took branches in her hand, and gave also to the women that were with her.  <span class="verse" rel="v04115  013" id="15  013" >13</span>
 And they put a garland of olive upon her and her maid that was with her, and she went before all the people in the dance, leading all the women: and all the men of Israel followed in their armor with garlands, and with songs in their mouths.  
<!-- 16   013 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="16  001">16  </span> Then Judith began to sing this thanksgiving in all Israel, and all the people sang after her this song of praise.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  002" id="16  002" >2</span>
 And Judith said, Begin to my God with timbrels, sing to my Lord with cymbals: tune to him a new psalm: exalt him, and call upon his name.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  003" id="16  003" >3</span>
 For God breaks the battles: for among the camps in the midst of the people he has delivered me out of the hands of them that persecuted me.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  004" id="16  004" >4</span>
 Assur came out of the mountains from the north, he came with ten thousands of his army, the multitude whereof stopped the torrents, and their horsemen have covered the hills.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  005" id="16  005" >5</span>
 He bragged that he would burn up my borders, and kill my young men with the sword, and dash the sucking children against the ground, and make my infants as a prey, and my virgins as a spoil.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  006" id="16  006" >6</span>
 But the Almighty Lord has disappointed them by the hand of a woman.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  007" id="16  007" >7</span>
 For the mighty one did not fall by the young men, neither did the sons of the Titans strike him, nor high giants set upon him: but Judith the daughter of Merari weakened him with the beauty of her countenance.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  008" id="16  008" >8</span>
 For she put off the garment of her widowhood for the exaltation of those that were oppressed in Israel, and anointed her face with ointment, and bound her hair in a tire, and took a linen garment to deceive him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  009" id="16  009" >9</span>
 Her sandals ravished his eyes, her beauty took his mind prisoner, and the fauchion passed through his neck.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  010" id="16  010" >10</span>
 The Persians quaked at her boldness, and the Medes were daunted at her hardiness.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  011" id="16  011" >11</span>
 Then my afflicted shouted for joy, and my weak ones cried aloud; but they were astonished: these lifted up their voices, but they were overthrown.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  012" id="16  012" >12</span>
 The sons of the damsels have pierced them through, and wounded them as fugatives' children: they perished by the battle of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  013" id="16  013" >13</span>
 I will sing to the Lord a new song: O Lord, you are great and glorious, wonderful in strength, and invincible.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  014" id="16  014" >14</span>
 Let all creatures serve you: for you spoke, and they were made, you did send forth your spirit, and it created them, and there is none that can resist your voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  015" id="16  015" >15</span>
 For the mountains shall be moved from their foundations with the waters, the rocks shall melt as wax at your presence: yet you are merciful to them that fear you.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  016" id="16  016" >16</span>
 For all sacrifice is too little for a sweet savor to you, and all the fat is not sufficient for your burnt offering: but he that fears the Lord is great at all times.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  017" id="16  017" >17</span>
 Woe to the nations that rise up against my kindred! the Lord Almighty will take vengeance of them in the day of judgment, in putting fire and worms in their flesh; and they shall feel them, and weep for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  018" id="16  018" >18</span>
 Now as soon as they entered into Jerusalem, they worshipped the Lord; and as soon as the people were purified, they offered their burnt offerings, and their free offerings, and their gifts.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  019" id="16  019" >19</span>
 Judith also dedicated all the stuff of Holofernes, which the people had given her, and gave the canopy, which she had taken out of his bedchamber, for a gift to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  020" id="16  020" >20</span>
 So the people continued feasting in Jerusalem before the sanctuary for the space of three months and Judith remained with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  021" id="16  021" >21</span>
 After this time every one returned to his own inheritance, and Judith went to Bethulia, and remained in her own possession, and was in her time honorable in all the country.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  022" id="16  022" >22</span>
 And many desired her, but none knew her all the days of her life, after that Manasses her husband was dead, and was gathered to his people.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  023" id="16  023" >23</span>
 But she increased more and more in honor, and waxed old in her husband's house, being an hundred and five years old, and made her maid free; so she died in Bethulia: and they buried her in the cave of her husband Manasses.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  024" id="16  024" >24</span>
 And the house of Israel lamented her seven days: and before she died, she did distribute her goods to all them that were nearest of kindred to Manasses her husband, and to them that were the nearest of her kindred.  <span class="verse" rel="v04116  025" id="16  025" >25</span>
 And there was none that made the children of Israel any more afraid in the days of Judith, nor a long time after her death.
