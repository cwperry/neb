<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">A</span>nd it came to pass after the death of Joshua, that the children of Israel enquired of the Lord, saying, Who shall go up for us first against the Chananites, to fight against them?  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 And the Lord said, Judas shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 And Judas said to his brother Symeon, Come up with me into my lot, and let us array ourselves against the Chananites, and I also will go with you into your lot: and Symeon went with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And Judas went up; and the Lord delivered the Chananite and the Pherezite into their hands, and they struck them in Bezek to   the number of   ten thousand men.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 And they overtook Adonibezek in Bezek, and fought against him; and they struck the Chananite and the Pherezite.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 And Adonibezek fled, and they pursued after him, and took him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 And Adonibezek said, Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered   their food   under my table: as I therefore have done, so God has recompensed me: and they  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   bring.  </span>  brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 And the children of Judas fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and struck with the edge of the sword, and they burnt the city with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 And afterwards the children of Judas went down to fight with the Chananite dwelling in the hill country, and the south, and the plain country.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 And Judas went to the Chananite who lived in Chebron; and Chebron came out against him;   and the name of Chebron before was Cariatharbocsepher:   and they struck Sessi, and Achiman, and Tholmi, children of Enac.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 And they went up thence to the inhabitants of Dabir; but the name of Dabir was before Cariathsepher, the city of Letters.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 And Chaleb said, Whosoever shall strike the city of Letters, and shall first take it, I will give to him Ascha my daughter to wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 And Gothoniel the younger son of Kenez the brother of Chaleb took it; and Chaleb gave him his daughter Ascha to wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 And it came to pass as she went in, that Gothoniel urged her to ask a field of her father; and she murmured and cried from off her ass, You have sent me forth into a south land: and Chaleb said to her,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   what ails you?  </span>  What is your request?  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 And Ascha said to him, Give me, I pray you, a blessing, for you have sent me forth into a south land, and you shall give me the ransom of water: and Chaleb gave her according to her heart the ransom of the upper   springs   and the ransom of the low   springs  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 And the children of Jothor the Kenite the father-in-law of Moses went up from the city of palm-trees with the children of Judas, to the wilderness that is in the south of Juda, which is at the descent of Arad, and they lived with the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 And Judas went with Symeon his brother, and struck the Chananite that inhabited Sepheth, and they utterly destroyed them; and they called the name of the city Anathema.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 But Judas did not inherit Gaza nor her coasts, nor Ascalon nor her coasts, nor Accaron nor her coasts,   nor   Azotus nor the lands around it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 And the Lord was with Judas, and he inherited the mountain; for they were not able to destroy the inhabitants of the valley, for  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. they had chariots of iron.  </span>  Rechab prevented them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 And they gave Chebron to Chaleb, as Moses said; and thence he inherited the three cities of the children of Enac.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  021" id="1  021" >21</span>
 But the children of Benjamin did not  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   inherit.  </span>  take the inheritance of the Jebusite who lived in Jerusalem; and the Jebusite lived with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  022" id="1  022" >22</span>
 And the sons of Joseph, they also went up to Baethel; and the Lord was with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  023" id="1  023" >23</span>
 And they encamped and surveyed Baethel: and the name of the city before was Luza.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  024" id="1  024" >24</span>
 And the spies looked, and behold, a man went out of the city, and they took him; and they said to him, Show us the way into the city, and we will deal mercifully with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  025" id="1  025" >25</span>
 And he showed them the way into the city; and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and his family.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  026" id="1  026" >26</span>
 And the man went into the land of Chettin, and built there a city, and called the name of it Luza; this   is   its name until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  027" id="1  027" >27</span>
 And Manasse did not drive out   the inhabitants of   Baethsan, which is a city of Scythians, nor her towns, nor her suburbs; nor Thanac, nor her  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   daughters.  </span>  towns; nor the inhabitants of Dor, nor her suburbs, nor her towns; nor the inhabitant of Balac, nor her suburbs, nor her towns; nor the inhabitants of Magedo, nor her suburbs, nor her towns; nor the inhabitants of Jeblaam, nor her suburbs, nor her towns; and the Chananite began to dwell in this land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  028" id="1  028" >28</span>
 And it came to pass when Israel was strong, that he made the Chananite tributary, but did not utterly drive them out.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  029" id="1  029" >29</span>
 And Ephraim did not drive out the Chananite that lived in Gazer; and the Chananite lived in the midst of him in Gazer, and became tributary.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  030" id="1  030" >30</span>
 And Zabulon did not drive out the inhabitants of Kedron, nor the inhabitants of Domana: and the Chananite lived in the midst of them, and became tributary to them.  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   him,   sc.   Zabulon.  </span>   <span class="verse" rel="v0071  031" id="1  031" >31</span>
 And Aser did not drive out the inhabitants of Accho, and   that people   became tributary to him, nor the inhabitants of Dor, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor the inhabitants of Dalaph, nor Aschazi, nor Chebda, nor Nai, nor Ereo.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  032" id="1  032" >32</span>
 And Aser lived in the midst of the Chananite who inhabited the land, for he could not drive him out.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  033" id="1  033" >33</span>
 And Nephthali did not drive out the inhabitants of Baethsamys, nor the inhabitants of Baethanach; and Nephthali lived in the midst of the Chananite who inhabited the land: but the inhabitants of Bethsamys and of Baetheneth became tributary to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  034" id="1  034" >34</span>
 And the Amorite drove out the children of Dan into the mountains, for they did not suffer them to come down into the valley.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  035" id="1  035" >35</span>
 And the Amorite began to dwell in the mountain of shells, in which   are   bears, and foxes, in Myrsinon, and in Thalabin; and the hand of the house of Joseph was heavy upon the Amorite, and he became tributary to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0071  036" id="1  036" >36</span>
 And the border of the Amorite   was   from the going up of Acrabin, from the rock and upwards.

<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> And an angel of the Lord went up from Galgal to the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. ככיס.  </span>    place of   weeping, and to Baethel, and to the house of Israel, and said to them, Thus says the Lord, I brought you up out of Egypt, and I brought you into the land which I sware to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant that I have made with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 And you° shall make no covenant with them that dwell in this land, neither shall you° worship their gods; but you° shall destroy their graven images, you° shall pull down their altars: but you° listened not to my voice, for you° did these things.  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 And I said, I will not drive them out from before you, but they shall be for a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   distresses.  </span>  distress to you, and their gods shall be to you for an offense.  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 And it came to pass when the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 And they named the name of that place Weepings; and they sacrificed there to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 And Joshua dismissed the people, and they went every man to his inheritance, to inherit the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that lived many days with Joshua, as many as knew all the great work of the Lord, what things he had wrought in Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 And Joshua the son of Naue, the servant of the Lord, died,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   son of a hundred and ten years.   Hebraism. </span>  a hundred and ten years old.  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance, in Thamnathares, in mount Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaas.  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 And all that generation were laid to their fathers: and another generation rose up after them, who knew not the Lord, nor yet the work which he wrought in Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 And the children of Israel wrought evil before the Lord, and served Baalim.  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 And they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and walked after other gods, of the gods of the nations round about them; and they worshipped them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 And they provoked the Lord, and forsook him, and served Baal and the Astartes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 And the Lord was very angry with Israel; and he gave them into the hands of the spoilers, and they spoiled them; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, and they could not any longer resist their enemies,  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 among whoever they went; and the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as the Lord spoke, and as the Lord sware to them; and he greatly afflicted them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 And the Lord raised up judges, and the Lord save them out of the hands of them that spoiled them: and yet they listened not to the judges,  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 for they went a whoring after other gods, and worshipped them; and they turned quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked to listen to the words of the Lord; they did not so.  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 And because the Lord raised them up judges, so the Lord was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the Lord  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   repented. This word seems generally to stand for כהס.  </span>  was moved at their groaning by reason of them that besieged them and afflicted them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 And it came to pass when the judge died, that they went back, and again corrupted   themselves   worse than their fathers to go after other gods to serve them an to worship them: they abandoned not their devices nor their stubborn ways.  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and said, Forasmuch as this nation has forsaken my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not listened to my voice,  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 therefore I will not any more cast out a man of the nations before their face, which Joshua the son of Naue left in the land. And   the Lord   left   them  ,  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 to prove Israel with them, whether they would keep the way of the Lord, to walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or no.  <span class="verse" rel="v0072  023" id="2  023" >23</span>
 So the Lord  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   left.  </span>  will leave these nations, so as not to cast them out suddenly; and he delivered them not into the hand of Joshua.

<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> And these   are   the nations which the Lord left to prove Israel with them, all that had not known the wars of Chanaan.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 Only for the sake of the generations of Israel, to teach them war, only the men before them knew them not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 The five lordships of the Phylistines, and every Chananite, and the Sidonian, and the Evite who lived in Libanus from the mount of Aermon to Laboemath.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 And   this   was done in order to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would obey the commands of the Lord, which he charged their fathers by the hand of Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 And the children of Israel lived in the midst of the Chananite, and the Chettite, and the Amorite, and the Pherezite, and the Evite, and the Jebusite.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 And they took their daughters for wives to themselves, and they gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and forgot the Lord their God, and served Baalim and the groves.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and sold them into the hand of Chusarsathaim king of Syria of the rivers: and the children of Israel served Chusarsathaim eight years.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 And the children of Israel cried to the Lord; and the Lord raised up a savior to Israel, and he saved them, Gothoniel the son of Kenez, the brother of Chaleb younger than himself.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war against Chusarsathaim: and the Lord delivered into his hand Chusarsathaim king of Syria of the rivers, and his hand prevailed against Chusarsathaim.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 And the land was quiet forty years; and Gothoniel the son of Kenez died.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 And the children of Israel continued to do evil before the Lord: and the Lord strengthened Eglom king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 And he gathered to himself all the children of Ammon and Amalec, and went and struck Israel, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   it inherited.  </span>  took possession of the city of Palm-trees.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 And the children of Israel served Eglom the king of Moab eighteen years.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 And the children of Israel cried to the Lord; and he raised up to them a savior, Aod the son of Gera a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        i.e.   Benjamite.  </span>  son of Jemeni, a man  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   able to use his left hand as his right.   q.d.  with two right hands.  </span>  who used both hands alike: and the children of Israel sent gifts by his hand to Eglom king of Moab.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 And Aod made himself a dagger of two edges, of a span long, and he girded it under his cloak upon his right thigh.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 And he went, and brought the presents to Eglom king of Moab, and Eglom   was   a very handsome man.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 And it came to pass when   Aod   had made an end of offering his gifts, that he dismissed those that brought the gifts.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  019" id="3  019" >19</span>
 And he himself returned from the quarries that are by Galgal; and Aod said, I have a secret errand to you, O king! and Eglom said to him, Be silent: and he sent away from his presence all who waited upon him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  020" id="3  020" >20</span>
 And Aod went in to him; and he sat in his own upper summer chamber quite alone; and Aod said, I have a message from God to you, O king: and Eglom rose up from his throne near him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  021" id="3  021" >21</span>
 And it came to pass as he arose, that Aod stretched forth his left hand, and took the dagger off his right thigh, and plunged it into his belly;  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  022" id="3  022" >22</span>
 and drove in also the haft after the blade, and the fat closed in upon the blade, for he drew not out the dagger from his belly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  023" id="3  023" >23</span>
 And Aod went out to the porch, and passed out by the appointed   guards  , and shut the doors of the chamber upon him, and locked   them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  024" id="3  024" >24</span>
 And he went out: and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   his.  </span>  Eglom's servants came, and saw, and behold, the doors of the upper chamber   were   locked; and they said, Does he not uncover his feet in the summer-chamber?  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  025" id="3  025" >25</span>
 And they waited till they were ashamed, and, behold, there  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   is.  </span>  was no one that opened the doors of the upper chamber; and they took the key, and opened them; and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead upon the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  026" id="3  026" >26</span>
 And Aod escaped while they were in a tumult, and no one paid attention to him; and he passed the quarries, and escaped to Setirotha.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  027" id="3  027" >27</span>
 And it came to pass when Aod came into the land of Israel, that he blew the horn in mount Ephraim, and the children of Israel came down with him from the mountain, and he   was   before them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  028" id="3  028" >28</span>
 And he said to them, Come down after me, for the Lord God has delivered our enemies, even Moab, into our hand; and they went down after him, and seized on the fords of Jordan before Moab, and he did not suffer a man to pass over.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  029" id="3  029" >29</span>
 And they struck Moab on that day about ten thousand men, every   lusty   person and every mighty man; and not a man escaped.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  030" id="3  030" >30</span>
 So Moab was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   put to shame.  </span>  humbled in that day under the hand of Israel, and the land had rest eighty years; and Aod judged them till he died.  <span class="verse" rel="v0073  031" id="3  031" >31</span>
 And after him rose up Samegar the son of Dinach, and struck the Philistines to the number of six hundred men with a plowshare   such as is drawn by   oxen; and he too delivered Israel.

 And the children of Israel cried to the Lord, because he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and he mightily oppressed Israel twenty years.  <span class="verse" rel="v0074  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 And Debbora, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, —she judged Israel at that time.  <span class="verse" rel="v0074  005" id="4  005" >5</span>
 And she sat under the palm tree of Debbora between Rama and Baethel in mount Ephraim; and the children of Israel went up to her for judgment.  <span class="verse" rel="v0074  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 And Debbora sent and called Barac the son of Abineem out of Cades Nephthali, and she said to him, Has not the Lord God of Israel commanded you? and you shall depart to mount Thabor, and shall take with yourself ten thousand men of the sons of Nephthali and of the sons of Zabulon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0074  007" id="4  007" >7</span>

 And Barac said to her, If you will go with me, I will go; and if you will not go, I will not go; for I know not the day on which the Lord prospers his messenger with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0074  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 And she said, I will surely go with you; but know that your honor shall not attend on the expedition on which you go, for the Lord shall sell Sisara into the hands of a women: and Debbora arose, and went with Barac out of Cades.  <span class="verse" rel="v0074  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 And Barac called Zabulon and Nephthali out of Cades, and there went up at his feet ten thousand men, and Debbora went up with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0074  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 And Chaber the Kenite had removed from Caina, from the sons of Jobab the father-in-law of Moses, and pitched his tent by the oak of the covetous ones, which is near Kedes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0074  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 And it was told Sisara that Barac the son of Abineem was gone up to mount Thabor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0074  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 And Sisara  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   called.  </span>  summoned all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron and all the people with him, from Arisoth of the Gentiles to the brook of Kison.  <span class="verse" rel="v0074  014" id="4  014" >14</span>
 And Debbora said to Barac, Rise up, for this   is   the day on which the Lord has delivered Sisara into your hand, for the Lord shall go forth before you: and Barac went down from mount Thabor, and ten thousand men after him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0074  015" id="4  015" >15</span>
 And the Lord discomfited Sisara, and all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barac: and Sisara descended from off his chariot, and fled on his feet.  <span class="verse" rel="v0074  016" id="4  016" >16</span>
 And Barac  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   pursuing.  </span>  pursued after the chariots and after the army, into Arisoth of the Gentiles; and the whole army of Sisara fell by the edge of the sword, there was not one left.  <span class="verse" rel="v0074  017" id="4  017" >17</span>
 And Sisara fled on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Chaber the Kenite his friend: for there was peace between Jabin king of Asor and the house of Chaber the Kenite.  <span class="verse" rel="v0074  018" id="4  018" >18</span>
 And Jael went, out to meet Sisara, and said to him, Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me, fear not: and he turned aside to her into the tent; and she covered him with a mantle.  <span class="verse" rel="v0074  019" id="4  019" >19</span>
 And Sisara said to her, Give me, I pray you, a little water to drink, for I am thirsty: and she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him to drink, and covered him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0074  020" id="4  020" >20</span>
 And Sisara said to her, Stand now by the door of the tent, and it shall come to pass if any man come to you, and ask of you, and say, Is there   any   man here? then you shall say, There is not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0074  021" id="4  021" >21</span>
 And Jael the wife of Chaber took  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the pin.  </span>  a pin of the tent, and took a hammer in her hand, and went secretly to him, and fastened the pin in his temple, and it went through to the earth, and he fainted away, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   he was darkened.  </span>  darkness fell upon him and he died.  <span class="verse" rel="v0074  022" id="4  022" >22</span>

 So God routed Jabin king of Chanaan in that day before the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0074  024" id="4  024" >24</span>
 And the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin king of Chanaan, until they utterly destroyed Jabin king of Chanaan.

 And Gedeon said to him,   Be gracious    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. כי a particle of entreaty, here rendered literally.  </span>  with me, my Lord: but if the Lord is with us, why have these evils found us? and where are all his miracles, which our fathers have related to us, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt? and now he has cast us out, and given us into the hand of Madiam.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  014" id="6  014" >14</span>
 And the angel of the Lord turned to him, and said, Go in this your strength, and you shall save Israel out of the hand of Madiam: behold, I have sent you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  015" id="6  015" >15</span>
 And Gedeon said to him,   Be gracious   with me, my Lord: whereby shall I save Israel? behold, my thousand is weakened in Manasse, and I am the least in my father's house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  016" id="6  016" >16</span>
 And the angel of the Lord said to him, The Lord shall be with you, and you shall strike Madiam as one man.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  017" id="6  017" >17</span>
 And Gedeon said to him, If now I have found mercy in your eyes, and you will do this day for me all that you have spoken of with me,  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  018" id="6  018" >18</span>
 depart not hence until I come to you, and I will bring forth an offering and offer it before you: and he said, I will remain until you return.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  019" id="6  019" >19</span>
 And Gedeon went in, and prepared a kid of the goats, and an ephah of fine flour unleavened; and he put the flesh in the basket, and poured the broth into the pot, and brought them forth to him under the turpentine tree, and drew near.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  020" id="6  020" >20</span>
 And the angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and put them on that rock, and pour out the broth close by: and he did so.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  021" id="6  021" >21</span>
 And the angel of the Lord stretched out the end of the rod that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened bread; and fire came up out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened bread, and the angel of the Lord vanished from his sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  022" id="6  022" >22</span>
 And Gedeon saw that he was an angel of the Lord; and Gedeon said, Ah, ah, Lord my God! for I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  023" id="6  023" >23</span>
 And the Lord said to him, Peace be to you, fear not, you shall not die.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  024" id="6  024" >24</span>
 And Gedeon built there an altar to the Lord, and called it The peace of the Lord, until this day, as it is still inEphratha of the father of Esdri.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  025" id="6  025" >25</span>
 And it came to pass in that night, that the Lord said to him, Take the young bullock which your father has, even the second bullock of seven years old, and you shall destroy the altar of Baal which your father has, and the grove which is by itthou shall destroy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  026" id="6  026" >26</span>
 And you shall build an altar to the Lord your God on the top of this Maozi in  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   the ordered place.  </span>  the ordering  it  , and you shall take the second bullock, and shall offer up whole burnt offerings with the wood of the grove, which you shall destroy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  027" id="6  027" >27</span>
 And Gedeon took ten men of his servants, and did as the Lord spoke to him: and it came to pass, as he feared the house of his father and the men of the city  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   because of the doing it.  </span>  if he should do it by day, that he did it by night.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  028" id="6  028" >28</span>
 And the men of the city rose up early in the morning; and behold, the altar of Baal had been demolished, and the grove by it had been destroyed; and they saw the second bullock, which Gedeon offered on the altar that had been built.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  029" id="6  029" >29</span>
 And a man said to his neighbor, Who has done this thing? and they enquired and searched, and learned that Gedeon the son of Joas had done this thing.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  030" id="6  030" >30</span>
 And the men of the city said to Joas, Bring out your son, and let him die, because he has destroyed the altar of Baal, and because he has destroyed the grove that is by it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  031" id="6  031" >31</span>
 And Gedeon the son of Joas said to all the men who rose up against him, Do you° now plead for Baal, or will you° save him? whoever will plead for him, let him be slain this morning: if he be a god let him plead for himself,   because   one has thrown down his altar.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  032" id="6  032" >32</span>
 And he called it in that day Jerobaal, saying, Let Baal plead thereby, because his altar has been thrown down.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  033" id="6  033" >33</span>
 And all Madiam, and Amalek, and the sons of the east gathered themselves together, and encamped in the valley of Jezrael.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  034" id="6  034" >34</span>
 And the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gedeon, and he blew with the horn, and Abiezer came to help after him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  035" id="6  035" >35</span>
 And   Gedeon   sent messengers into all Manasse, and into Aser, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in.  </span>  into Zabulon, and into Nephthali; and he went up to meet them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  036" id="6  036" >36</span>
 And Gedeon said to God, If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said,  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  037" id="6  037" >37</span>
 behold, I put the fleece of wool in the threshing floor: if there be dew on the fleece only, and drought on all the ground, I shall know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  038" id="6  038" >38</span>
 And it was so: and he rose up early in the morning, and wrung the fleece, and dew dropped from the fleece, a bowl full of water.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  039" id="6  039" >39</span>
 And Gedeon said to God, Let not, I pray you, your anger be kindled with me, and I will speak yet once; I will even yet make one trial more with the fleece: let now the drought be upon the fleece only, and let there be dew on all the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v0076  040" id="6  040" >40</span>
 And God did so in that night; and there was drought on the fleece only, and on all the ground there was dew.

<p><span class="chapter" id="7  001">7  </span> And Jerobaal rose early, the same is Gedeon, and all the people with him, and encamped at the fountain of Arad; and the camp of Madiam was to the north of him,   reaching   from Gabaathamorai, in the valley.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  002" id="7  002" >2</span>
 And the Lord said to Gedeon, The people with you   are   many, so that I may not deliver Madiam into their hand, lest at any time Israel boast against me, saying, My hand has saved me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  003" id="7  003" >3</span>
 And now speak in the ears of the people, saying, Who   is   afraid and fearful? let him turn and depart from mount Galaad: and there returned of the people twenty-two thousand, and ten thousand were left.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  004" id="7  004" >4</span>
 And the Lord said to Gedeon, The people is yet numerous; bring them down to the water, and I will purge them there for you: and it shall come to pass that of whoever I shall say to you, This one shall go with you,   even   he shall go with you; and of whoever I shall say to you, This one shall not go with you,   even   he shall not go with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  005" id="7  005" >5</span>
 And he brought the people down to the water; and the Lord said to Gedeon, Whosoever shall lap of the water with his tongue as if a dog should lap, you shall set him apart, and   also   whoever shall bow down upon his knees to drink.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  006" id="7  006" >6</span>
 And the number of those that lapped with their hand to their mouth was three hundred men; and all the rest of the people bowed upon their knees to drink water.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  007" id="7  007" >7</span>
 And the Lord said to Gedeon, I will save you by the three hundred men that lapped, and I will give Madiam into your hand; and all the   rest of the   people shall go every one to his place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  008" id="7  008" >8</span>
 And they took the provision of the people in their hand, and their horns; and he sent away every man of Israel each to his tent, and he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   encouraged.  </span>  strengthened the three hundred; and the army of Madiam were beneath him in the valley.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  009" id="7  009" >9</span>
 And it came to pass in that night that the Lord said to him, Arise, go down into the camp, for I have delivered it into your hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  010" id="7  010" >10</span>
 And if you are afraid to go down, go down you and your servant Phara into the camp.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  011" id="7  011" >11</span>
 And you shall hear what they shall say, and afterwards your hands shall be strong, and you shall go down into the camp: and he went down and Phara his servant to the extremity of the   companies of   fifty, which were in the camp.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  012" id="7  012" >12</span>
 And Madiam and Amalec and all the children of the east   were   scattered in the valley, as the locust for multitude; and there was no number to their camels, but they were as the sand on the seashore for multitude.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  013" id="7  013" >13</span>
 And Gedeon came, and behold a man   was   relating to his neighbor a dream, and he said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream, and behold, a cake of barley bread rolling into the camp of Madiam, and it came as far as a tent, and struck it, and it fell, and it turned it up, and the tent fell.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  014" id="7  014" >14</span>
 And his neighbor answered and said, This is none other than the sword of Gedeon, son of Joas, a man of Israel: God has delivered Madiam and all the host into his hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  015" id="7  015" >15</span>
 And it came to pass when Gedeon heard the account of the dream and the interpretation of it, that he worshipped the Lord, and returned to the camp of Israel, and said, Rise, for the Lord has delivered the camp of Madiam into our hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  016" id="7  016" >16</span>
 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and put horns in the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   hand.  </span>  hands of all, and empty pitchers, and torches in the pitchers:  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  017" id="7  017" >17</span>
 and he said to them, You° shall look  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from.   q.d.   at the actions proceeding from me.  </span>  at me, and so shall you° do; and behold, I will go into the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   corner.

 And I will sound with the horn, and all you° with me shall sound with the horn round about the whole camp, and you° shall say, For the Lord and Gedeon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  019" id="7  019" >19</span>
 And Gedeon and the hundred men that were with him came to the extremity of the army in the beginning of the middle watch; and they completely roused the guards, and sounded with the horns, and they  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   shook off.  </span>  broke the pitchers that were in their hands,  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  020" id="7  020" >20</span>
 and the three companies sounded with the horns, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and in their right hands their horns to sound with; and they cried out, A sword for the Lord and for Gedeon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  021" id="7  021" >21</span>
 And   every   man stood in his place round about the host; and all the host ran, and sounded   an alarm  , and fled.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  022" id="7  022" >22</span>
 And they sounded with the three hundred horns; and the Lord set   every   man's sword in all the host against his neighbor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  023" id="7  023" >23</span>
 And the host fled as far as Bethseed Tagaragatha Abel-meula to Tabath; and the men of Israel from Nephthali, and from Aser, and from all Manasse, came to help, and followed after Madiam.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  024" id="7  024" >24</span>
 And Gedeon sent messengers  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in.  </span>  into all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down to meet Madiam, and take to yourselves the water as far as Baethera and Jordan: and every man of Ephraim cried out, and they took the water before hand to Baethera and Jordan.  <span class="verse" rel="v0077  025" id="7  025" >25</span>
 And they took the princess of Madiam, even Oreb and Zeb; and they killed Oreb in Sur Oreb, and they killed Zeb in Jakephzeph; and they pursued Madiam, and brought the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   head.  </span>  heads of Oreb and Zeb to Gedeon from beyond Jordan.

<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> And the men of Ephraim said to Gedeon, What   is   this   that   you have done to us, in that you did not call us when you went to fight with Madiam? and they chode with him sharply.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 And he said to them, What have I now done in comparison of you?   is   not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 The Lord has delivered into your hand the princes of Madiam, Oreb and Zeb; and what could I do in comparison of you? Then was their spirit calmed toward him, when he spoke this word.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  004" id="8  004" >4</span>
 And Gedeon came to Jordan, and went over, himself and the three hundred with him, hungry, yet pursuing.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 And he said to the men of Socchoth, Give, I pray you, bread to feed this people that follow me; because they are faint, and behold, I am following after Zebee and Salmana, kings of Madiam.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 And the princes of Socchoth said,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. is   the hand.  </span>    Are   the hands of Zebee and Salmana now in your hand, that we should give bread to your host?  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  007" id="8  007" >7</span>
 And Gedeon said, Therefore when the Lord gives Zebee and Salmana into my hand, then will I  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   dig down.  </span>  tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness, and the Barkenim.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  008" id="8  008" >8</span>
 And he went up thence to Phanuel, and spoke to them likewise: and the men of Phanuel answered him as the men of Socchoth   had   answered him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 And Gedeon said to the men of Phanuel, When I return in peace, I will  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   thresh.  </span>  break down this tower.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 And Zebee and Salmana   were   in Carcar, and their host   was   with them, about fifteen thousand, all that were left of all the host of the aliens; and they that fell   were   a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  011" id="8  011" >11</span>
 And Gedeon went up by the way of them that lived in tents, eastward of Nabai and Jegebal; and he struck the host, and the host was secure.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  012" id="8  012" >12</span>
 And Zebee and Salmana fled; and he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Madiam, Zebee and Salmana, and discomfited all the army.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 And Gedeon the son of Joas returned from the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   array.  </span>  battle, down from the battle of Ares.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  014" id="8  014" >14</span>

 And Gedeon came to the princes of Socchoth, and said, Behold Zebee and Salmana, about whom you° reproached me, saying,   Are   the hands of Zebee and Salmana now in your hand, that we should give bread to your men that are faint?  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  016" id="8  016" >16</span>
 And he took the elders of the city with the thorns of the wilderness and the Barkenim, and with them he tore the men of the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  017" id="8  017" >17</span>
 And he overthrew the tower of Phanuel, and killed the men of the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  018" id="8  018" >18</span>
 And he said to Zebee and Salmana, Where   are   the men whom you° killed in Thabor? and they said, As you, so   were   they, according to the likeness of the son of a king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  019" id="8  019" >19</span>
 And Gedeon said, They were my brethren and the sons of my mother:   as   the Lord lives, if you° had preserved them alive, I would not have slain you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  020" id="8  020" >20</span>
 And he said to Jether his firstborn, Rise and kill them; but the lad drew not his sword, for he was afraid, for he was yet very young.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  021" id="8  021" >21</span>
 And Zebee and Salmana said, Rise you and fall upon us, for your power   is   as that of a man; and Gedeon arose, and killed Zebee and Salmana: and he took the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        i.e.   round like the moon; perhaps circular, or in the form of a crescent.  </span>  round ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  022" id="8  022" >22</span>
 And the men of Israel said to Gedeon, Rule,   my   lord, over us, both you, and your son, and your son's son; for you have saved us out of the hand of Madiam.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  023" id="8  023" >23</span>
 And Gedeon said to them, I will not rule, and my son shall not rule among you; the Lord shall rule over you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  024" id="8  024" >24</span>
 And Gedeon said to them, I will make a request of you, and do you° give me every man an earring out of his spoils: for they had golden earrings, for they were Ismaelites.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  025" id="8  025" >25</span>
 And they said,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   giving we will give.  </span>  We will certainly give them: and he opened his garment, and each man cast therein an earring of his spoils.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  026" id="8  026" >26</span>
 And the weight of the golden earrings which he asked, was a thousand and seven hundred pieces of gold, besides the crescents, and the chains, and the garments, and the purple cloths that were on the kings of Madiam, and besides the chains that were on the necks of their camels.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  027" id="8  027" >27</span>
 And Gedeon made an ephod of it, an set it in his city in Ephratha; and all Israel went there a whoring after it, and it became a stumbling block to Gedeon and his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  028" id="8  028" >28</span>
 And Madiam, was straitened before the children of Israel, and they did not lift up their head any more; and the land had rest forty years in the days of Gedeon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  029" id="8  029" >29</span>
 And Jerobaal the son of Joas went and sat in his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  030" id="8  030" >30</span>
 And Gedeon had seventy sons begotten of his body, for he had many wives.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  031" id="8  031" >31</span>
 And his concubine was in Sychem, and she also bore him a son, and gave him the name Abimelech.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  032" id="8  032" >32</span>
 And Gedeon son of Joas died in his city, and he was buried in the sepulchre of Joas his father in Ephratha of Abi-Esdri.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  033" id="8  033" >33</span>
 And it came to pass when Gedeon was dead, that the children of Israel turned, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made for themselves a covenant with Baal that he should be their god.  <span class="verse" rel="v0078  034" id="8  034" >34</span>

 And they gave him seventy   pieces   of silver out of the house of Baalberith; and Abimelech hired for himself vain and cowardly men, and they went after him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  005" id="9  005" >5</span>
 And he went to the house of his father to Ephratha, and killed his brethren the sons of Jerobaal, seventy men upon one stone; but Joatham the youngest son of Jerobaal was left, for he hid himself.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
 And all the men of Sicima, and all the house of Bethmaalo, were gathered together, and they went and made Abimelech king by the oak  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. מעכ. this is an instance of double translation, στάσεως being given for מעכ, and εὐρετῆ having reference to the word מעא   to find;   but   Alex.   rightly omits εὐρετῆ.  </span>  of Sedition, which was at Sicima.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 And it was reported to Joatham, and he went and stood on the top of mount Garizin, and lifted up his voice, and wept, and said to them, Hear me, you° men of Sicima, and God shall hear you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 The trees  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   went going.  </span>  went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive, Reign over us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 But the olives said to them, Shall I leave my fatness, with which men shall glorify God, and go to be  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   moved.  </span>  promoted over the trees?  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  010" id="9  010" >10</span>
 And the trees said to the fig tree, Come, reign over us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  011" id="9  011" >11</span>
 But the fig tree said to them, Shall I leave my sweetness an my good fruits, and go to be promoted over the trees?  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  012" id="9  012" >12</span>
 And the trees said to the vine, Come, reign over us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  013" id="9  013" >13</span>
 And the vine said to them, Shall I leave my wine that cheers God and men, and go to be promoted over the trees?  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  014" id="9  014" >14</span>
 Then all the trees said to the bramble, Come you and   reign   over us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  015" id="9  015" >15</span>
 And the bramble said to the trees, If you° in truth anoint me to reign over you, come, stand under my shadow; and if not, let fire come out from me and devour the cedars of Libanus.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  016" id="9  016" >16</span>
 And now, if you° have done it in truth and integrity, and have made Abimelech king, and if you° have wrought well with Jerobaal, and with his house, and if you° have done to him according to the reward of his hand,  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  017" id="9  017" >17</span>
 as my father fought for you, and put his life in jeopardy, and delivered you out of the hand of Madiam;  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  018" id="9  018" >18</span>
 and you° are risen up this day against the house of my father, and have slain his sons, being seventy men, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech the son of his bondwoman king over the men of Sicima, because he is your brother:  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  019" id="9  019" >19</span>
 if then you° have done truly and faithfully with Jerobaal, and with his house this day, rejoice you° in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice over you:  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  020" id="9  020" >20</span>
 but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Sicima, and the house of Bethmaalo; and let fire come out from the men of Sicima and from the house of Bethmaalo, and devour Abimelech.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  021" id="9  021" >21</span>
 And Joatham fled, and ran away, and went as far as Baeer, and lived there out of the way of his brother Abimelech.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  022" id="9  022" >22</span>
 And Abimelech reigned over Israel three years.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  023" id="9  023" >23</span>
 And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Sicima; and the men of Sicima  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   despised.  </span>  dealt treacherously  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   in the house.

 to bring the injury done to the seventy sons of Jerobaal, and to lay their blood upon their brother Abimelech, who killed them, and upon the men of Sicima, because they strengthened his hands to kill his brethren.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  025" id="9  025" >25</span>
 And the men of Sicima set liers in wait against him on the top of the mountains, and robbed every one who passed by them on the way; and it was reported to the king Abimelech.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  026" id="9  026" >26</span>
 And Gaal son of Jobel came, and his brethren, and passed by Sicima, and the men of Sicima trusted in him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  027" id="9  027" >27</span>
 And they went out into the field, and gathered their  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   vines.  </span>  grapes, and trod them, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   made   ellulim,   a Hebrew word.

 And Gaal the son of Jobel said, Who is Abimelech, and who is the son of Sychem, that we should serve him?   Is he   not the son of Jerobaal, and   is   not Zebul his steward, his servant with the son of Emmor the father of Sychem? and why should we serve him?  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  029" id="9  029" >29</span>
 And would that this people were under my hand!  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and I will.  </span>  then would I remove Abimelech, and I would say to him, Multiply your host, and come out.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  030" id="9  030" >30</span>
 And Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Jobel, and he was very angry.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  031" id="9  031" >31</span>
 And he sent messengers to Abimelech secretly, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Jobel and his brethren are come to Sychem; and behold, they have besieged the city against you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  032" id="9  032" >32</span>
 And now rise up by night, you and the people with you, and lay wait in the field.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  033" id="9  033" >33</span>
 And it shall come to pass in the morning at sunrising, you shall rise up early and draw toward the city; and behold, he and the people with him  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   are coming, etc.  </span>  will come forth against you, and you shall do to him  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   whatever they hand shall find.  </span>  according to your power.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  034" id="9  034" >34</span>
 And Abimelech and all the people with him rose up by night, and formed an ambuscade against Sychem in four companies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  035" id="9  035" >35</span>
 And Gaal the son of Jobel went forth, and stood by the door of the gate of the city: and Abimelech and the people with him rose up from the ambuscade.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  036" id="9  036" >36</span>
 And Gaal the son of Jobel saw the people, and said to Zebul, Behold, a people comes down from the top of the mountains: and Zebul said to him, You see the shadow of the mountains as men.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  037" id="9  037" >37</span>
 And Gaal continued to speak and said, Behold, a people comes down  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   by the sea. A double rendering, perhaps to מעס, the first κατὰ θάλασσαν - the second, ὐπὸ τοῦ ἐχόμενα.  </span>  westward from the part bordering on the middle of the land, and another company comes by  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.   translates the words   “the way of the oak of the seers.” </span>  the way of Helon Maonenim.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  038" id="9  038" >38</span>
 And Zebul said to him, And where is your mouth as you spoke, Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?   Is   not this the people whom you despised? go forth now, and set the battle in array against him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  039" id="9  039" >39</span>
 And Gaal went forth before the men of Sychem, and set the battle in array against Abimelech.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  040" id="9  040" >40</span>
 And Abimelech pursued him, and he fled from before him; and many fell down slain as far as the door of the gate.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  041" id="9  041" >41</span>
 And Abimelech entered into Arema, and Zebul cast out Gaal and his brethren, so that they should not dwell in Sychem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  042" id="9  042" >42</span>
 And it came to pass on the second day that the people went out into the field, and   one   brought word to Abimelech.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  043" id="9  043" >43</span>
 And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and formed an ambush in the field; and he looked, and, behold, the people went forth out of the city, and he rose up against them, and struck them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  044" id="9  044" >44</span>
 And Abimelech and the chiefs of companies that were with him rushed forward, and stood by the door of the gate of the city; and the two   other   companies rushed forward upon all that were in the field, and struck them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  045" id="9  045" >45</span>
 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day, and took the city, and killed the people that were in it, and destroyed the city, and sowed it with salt.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  046" id="9  046" >46</span>
 And all the men of the tower of Sychem heard, and came to the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Some read ὀχύρωμα.  </span>  gathering of Baethel-berith.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  047" id="9  047" >47</span>
 And it was reported to Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Sychem were gathered together.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  048" id="9  048" >48</span>
 And Abimelech went up to the mount of Selmon, and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   axes.  </span>  an axe in his hand, and cut down a branch of a tree, and took it, and laid it on his shoulders; and said to the people that were with him, What you° see me doing, do quickly as I.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  049" id="9  049" >49</span>
 And they cut down likewise even every man a branch, and went after Abimelech, and laid them against the place of gathering, and burnt the place of gathering over them with fire; and they died, even all the men of the tower of Sicima, about a thousand men and women.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  050" id="9  050" >50</span>
 And Abimelech went out of Baethel-berith, and encamped against  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in.  </span>  Thebes, and took it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  051" id="9  051" >51</span>
 And there was a strong tower in the midst of the city; and there all the men and the women of the city fled, and shut   the door   without them, and went up on the roof of the tower.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  052" id="9  052" >52</span>
 And Abimelech drew near to the tower, and they besieged it; and Abimelech drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  053" id="9  053" >53</span>
 And a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon the head of Abimelech, and broke his skull.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  054" id="9  054" >54</span>
 And he cried out quickly to the young man his armor-bearer, and said to him, Draw your sword, and kill me, lest at any time they should say, A woman killed him: and his young man thrust him through and he died.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  055" id="9  055" >55</span>
 And the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead; and they went each to his place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  056" id="9  056" >56</span>
 So God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he wrought against his father, in slaying his seventy brethren.  <span class="verse" rel="v0079  057" id="9  057" >57</span>
 And all the wickedness of the men of Sychem God requited upon their head; and the curse of Joatham the son of Jerobaal came upon them.

 And the wife of Galaad bore him sons; and the sons of his wife grew up, and they cast out Jephthae, and said to him, You shall not inherit in the house of our father, for you are the son of a concubine.  <span class="verse" rel="v00711  003" id="11  003" >3</span>
 And Jephthae fled from the face of his brethren, and lived in the land of Tob; and vain men gathered to Jephthae, and went out with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00711  004" id="11  004" >4</span>
 And it came to pass when the children of Ammon prepared to fight with Israel,  <span class="verse" rel="v00711  005" id="11  005" >5</span>
 that the elders of Galaad went to fetch Jephthae from the land of Tob.  <span class="verse" rel="v00711  006" id="11  006" >6</span>
 And they said to Jephthae, Come, and be our head, and we will fight with the sons of Ammon.  <span class="verse" rel="v00711  007" id="11  007" >7</span>
 And Jephthae said to the elders of Galaad, Did you° not hate me, and cast me out of my father's house, and banish me from you? and therefore are you° come to me now when you° lack me?  <span class="verse" rel="v00711  008" id="11  008" >8</span>
 And the elders of Galaad said to Jephthae, Therefore have we now turned to you,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and you shall.  </span>  that you should go with us, and fight against the sons of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Galaad.  <span class="verse" rel="v00711  009" id="11  009" >9</span>
 And Jephthae said to the elders of Galaad, If you° turn me back to fight with the children of Ammon, and the Lord should deliver them before me, then will I be your head.  <span class="verse" rel="v00711  010" id="11  010" >10</span>
 And the elders of Galaad said to Jephthae, The Lord be witness between us, if we shall not do according to your word.  <span class="verse" rel="v00711  011" id="11  011" >11</span>
 And Jephthae went with the elders of Galaad, and the people made him head and ruler over them: and Jephthae spoke all his words before the Lord in Massepha.  <span class="verse" rel="v00711  012" id="11  012" >12</span>
 And Jephthae sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have I to do with you, that you have come against me to fight in my land?  <span class="verse" rel="v00711  013" id="11  013" >13</span>
 And the king of the children of Ammon said to the messengers of Jephthae, Because Israel took my land when he went up out of Egypt, from Arnon to Jaboc, and to Jordan: now then return them peaceably and I will depart.  <span class="verse" rel="v00711  014" id="11  014" >14</span>
 And Jephthae again sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon,  <span class="verse" rel="v00711  015" id="11  015" >15</span>

 And   they   journeyed in the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab: and they came by the east of the land of Moab, an encamped in the country beyond Arnon, and came not within the borders of Moab, for Arnon   is   the border of Moab.  <span class="verse" rel="v00711  019" id="11  019" >19</span>
 And Israel sent messengers to Seon king of the Amorite, king of Esbon, and Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray you, by your land to our place.  <span class="verse" rel="v00711  020" id="11  020" >20</span>
 And Seon did not trust Israel to pass by his coast; and Seon gathered all his people, and they encamped at Jasa; and he set the battle in array against Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00711  021" id="11  021" >21</span>
 And the Lord God of Israel delivered Seon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they struck him; and Israel inherited all the land of the Amorite who lived in that land,  <span class="verse" rel="v00711  022" id="11  022" >22</span>

 But the king of the children of Ammon listened not to the words of Jephthae, which he sent to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00711  029" id="11  029" >29</span>
 And the spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthae, and he passed over Galaad, and Manasse, and passed by the watch-tower of Galaad to the other side of the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" rel="v00711  030" id="11  030" >30</span>

 And there was a man of Saraa, of the family of the kindred of Dan, and his name was Manoe, and his wife was barren, and bore not.  <span class="verse" rel="v00713  003" id="13  003" >3</span>

 But his wife said to him, If the Lord were pleased to kill us, he would not have received of our hand a whole burnt offering and a meat-offering; and he would not have shown us all these things, neither would he have caused us to hear all these things  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   as the time is.  </span>   <span class="verse" rel="v00713  024" id="13  024" >24</span>

 And the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   man.  </span>  men of Juda said, Why are you° come up against us? and the Philistines said, We are come up to bind Sampson, and to do to him as he has done to us.  <span class="verse" rel="v00715  011" id="15  011" >11</span>
 And the three thousand men of Juda went down to the hole of the rock Etam, and they said to Sampson, Know you not that the Philistines rule over us? and what   is   this   that   you have done to us? and Sampson said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00715  012" id="15  012" >12</span>
 And they said to him, We are come down to bind you to deliver you into the hand of the Philistines: and Sampson said to them, Swear to me that you° will not fall upon me yourselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v00715  013" id="15  013" >13</span>
 And they spoke to him, saying, Nay, but we will only bind you fast, and deliver you into their hand, and will by no means kill you: and they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him from that rock.  <span class="verse" rel="v00715  014" id="15  014" >14</span>
 And they came to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the jaw.  </span>  Lechi: and the Philistines shouted, and ran to meet him: and the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and the ropes that were upon his arms became as tow which is burnt with fire; and his bonds were consumed from off his hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v00715  015" id="15  015" >15</span>
 And he found the jaw-bone of an ass that had been cast away, and he put forth his hand and took it, and struck with it a thousand men.  <span class="verse" rel="v00715  016" id="15  016" >16</span>
 And Sampson said, With the jaw-bone of an ass I have utterly destroyed them, for with the jaw-bone of an ass I have struck a thousand men.  <span class="verse" rel="v00715  017" id="15  017" >17</span>
 And it came to pass when he ceased speaking, that he cast the jaw-bone out of his hand; and he called that place the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        This, though unusual, is possibly the meaning of ἀναίρεσις here.  </span>  Lifting of the jaw-bone.  <span class="verse" rel="v00715  018" id="15  018" >18</span>
 And he was very thirsty, and wept before the Lord, and said, You have been well pleased to grant this great deliverance by the hand of your servant, and new shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?  <span class="verse" rel="v00715  019" id="15  019" >19</span>
 And God broke open a hollow place in the jaw, and there came thence water, and he drank; and his spirit returned and he revived: therefore the name of  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   it.  </span>  the fountain was called 'The well of the invoker,' which is in Lechi, until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00715  020" id="15  020" >20</span>
 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.

<p><span class="chapter" id="16  001">16  </span> And Sampson went to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and went in to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  002" id="16  002" >2</span>
 And it was reported to the Gazites, saying, Sampson is come here: and they compassed him and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and they were quiet all the night, saying, Let us wait till the dawn appear, and we will kill him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  003" id="16  003" >3</span>
 And Sampson slept till midnight, and rose up at midnight, and took hold of the doors of the gate of the city with the two posts, and lifted them up with the bar, and laid them on his shoulders, and he went up to the top of the mountain that is before Chebron, and laid them there.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  004" id="16  004" >4</span>
 And it came to pass after this that he loved a woman in  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.   the brook of Sorech.  </span>  Alsorech, and her name   was   Dalida.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  005" id="16  005" >5</span>
 And the princess of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, Beguile him, and see wherein his great strength   is  , and wherewith we shall prevail against him, and bind him to humble him; and we will give you  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a man.  </span>  each eleven hundred   pieces   of silver.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  006" id="16  006" >6</span>
 And Dalida said to Sampson, Tell me, I pray you, wherein   is   your great strength, and wherewith you shall be bound that you may be humbled.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  007" id="16  007" >7</span>
 And Sampson said to her, If they bind me with seven moist cords that have not been spoiled, then shall I be weak and be as one of ordinary men.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  008" id="16  008" >8</span>
 And the princess of the Philistines brought to her seven moist cords that had not been spoiled, and she bound him with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  009" id="16  009" >9</span>
 And the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   ambush,   singular. </span>  liers in wait remained with her in the chamber; and she said to him, the Philistines   are   upon you, Sampson: and he broke the cords as if any one should break a thread of tow when it has  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   smelt.  </span>  touched the fire, and his strength was not known.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  010" id="16  010" >10</span>
 And Dalida said to Sampson, Behold, you have cheated me, and told me lies; now then tell me wherewith you shall be bound.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  011" id="16  011" >11</span>
 And he said to her, If they should bind me fast with new ropes with which work has not been done, then shall I be weak, and shall be as another man.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  012" id="16  012" >12</span>
 And Dalida took new ropes, and bound him with them, and the liers in wait came out of the chamber, and she said, The Philistines   are   upon you, Sampson: and he broke them off his arms like a thread.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  013" id="16  013" >13</span>
 And Dalida said to Sampson, Behold, you have deceived me, and told me lies; tell me, I entreat you, wherewith you may be bound: and he said to her, If you should weave the seven locks of my head with the web, and should fasten them with the pin into the wall, then shall I be weak as another man.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  014" id="16  014" >14</span>
 And it came to pass when he was asleep, that Dalida took the seven locks of his head, and wove them with the web, and fastened them with the pin into the wall, and she said, The Philistines   are   upon you, Sampson: and he awoke out of his sleep, and carried away the pin of the web out of the wall.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  015" id="16  015" >15</span>
 And Dalida said to Sampson, How say you, I love you, when your heart is not with me? this third time you have deceived me, and have not told me wherein   is   your great strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  016" id="16  016" >16</span>
 And it came to pass as she pressed him sore with her words continually, and straitened him, that his spirit failed almost to death.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  017" id="16  017" >17</span>
 Then he told her all his heart, and said to her, A razor has not come upon my head, because I have been a holy   one   of God from my mother's womb; if then I should be shaven, my strength will depart from me, and I shall be weak, and I shall be as all   other   men.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  018" id="16  018" >18</span>
 And Dalida saw that he told her all his heart, and she sent and called the princess of the Philistines, saying, Come up yet this once; for he has told me all his heart. And the chiefs of the Philistines went up to her, and brought the money in their hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  019" id="16  019" >19</span>
 And Dalida made Sampson sleep upon her knees; and she called a man, and he shaved the seven locks of his head, and she began to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        This word in LXX. seems generally to have the signification of   “to afflict.” </span>  humble him, and his strength departed from him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  020" id="16  020" >20</span>
 And Dalida said, The Philistines   are   upon you, Sampson: and he awoke out of his sleep and said, I will go out as at former times, and shake myself; and he knew not that the Lord was departed from him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  021" id="16  021" >21</span>
 And the Philistines took him, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   cut out.  </span>  put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he ground in the prison-house.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  022" id="16  022" >22</span>
 And the hair of his head began to grow  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   as he was shaven.  </span>  as before it was shaven.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  023" id="16  023" >23</span>
 And the chiefs of the Philistines met to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon, and to make merry; and they said, God has given into our hand our enemy Sampson.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  024" id="16  024" >24</span>
 And the people saw him, and sang praises to their god; for our god,   said they  , has delivered into our hand our enemy, who wasted our land, and who multiplied our slain.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  025" id="16  025" >25</span>
 And when their heart was merry, then they said, Call Sampson out of the prison-house, and let him play before us: and they called Sampson out of the prison-house, and he played before them; and they struck him with the palms of their hands, and set him between the pillars.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  026" id="16  026" >26</span>
 And Sampson said to the young man that held his hand, Suffer me to feel the pillars on which the house   rests  , and I will stay myself upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  027" id="16  027" >27</span>
 And the house   was   full of men and woman, and there were all the chiefs of the Philistines, and on the roof   were   about three thousand men and woman looking at the sports of Sampson.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  028" id="16  028" >28</span>
 And Sampson wept before the Lord, and said, O Lord, my lord, remember me, I pray you, and strengthen me, O God, yet this once, and I will requite one recompense to the Philistines for my two eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  029" id="16  029" >29</span>
 And Sampson took hold of the two pillars of the house on which the house stood, and leaned on them, and laid hold of one with his right hand, and the other with his left.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  030" id="16  030" >30</span>
 And Sampson said, Let my wife perish with the Philistines: and he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   bore; some read ἔκλινεν.  </span>  bowed himself mightily; and the house fell upon the princes, and upon all the people that were in it: and the dead whom Sampson killed in his death were more than those whom he killed in his life.  <span class="verse" rel="v00716  031" id="16  031" >31</span>
 And his brethren and his father's house went down, and they took him; and they went up and buried him between Saraa and Esthaol in the sepulchre of his father Manoe; and he judged Israel twenty years.

<p><span class="chapter" id="17  001">17  </span> And there was a man of mount Ephraim, and his name was Michaias.  <span class="verse" rel="v00717  002" id="17  002" >2</span>
 And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred pieces of silver which you took of yourself, and   about which   you cursed me, and spoke in my ears, behold, the silver   is   with me; I took it: and his mother said, Blessed   be   my son of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00717  003" id="17  003" >3</span>
 And he restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I had wholly consecrated the money to the Lord out of my hand for my son, to make a graven and a molten   image  , and now I will restore it to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00717  004" id="17  004" >4</span>
 But he returned the silver to his mother, and his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   it.  </span>  them to a silversmith, and he made it a graven and a molten image; and it was in the house of Michaias.  <span class="verse" rel="v00717  005" id="17  005" >5</span>
 And the house of Michaias   was   to him the house of God, and he made an ephod and theraphin, and he consecrated one of his sons, and he became to him a priest.  <span class="verse" rel="v00717  006" id="17  006" >6</span>
 And in those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00717  007" id="17  007" >7</span>
 And there was a young man in Bethleem of the tribe of Juda, and he   was   a Levite, and he was sojourning there.  <span class="verse" rel="v00717  008" id="17  008" >8</span>
 And the man departed from Bethleem the city of Juda to sojourn in whatever place he might find; and he came as far as mount Ephraim, and to the house of Michaias to accomplish his journey.  <span class="verse" rel="v00717  009" id="17  009" >9</span>
 And Michaias said to him, Whence come you? and he said to him, I am a Levite of Bethleem Juda, and I go to sojourn in any place I may find.  <span class="verse" rel="v00717  010" id="17  010" >10</span>
 And Michaias said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest; and I will give you ten pieces of silver by the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. ימיס   (year of) days. </span>  year, and a change of raiment, and your living.  <span class="verse" rel="v00717  011" id="17  011" >11</span>
 And the Levite went and began to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.  <span class="verse" rel="v00717  012" id="17  012" >12</span>
 And Michaias consecrated the Levite, and he became to him a priest, and he was in the house of Michaias.  <span class="verse" rel="v00717  013" id="17  013" >13</span>
 And Michaias said, Now I know that the Lord will do me good, because a Levite has become my priest.

<p><span class="chapter" id="18  001">18  </span> In those days there was no king in Israel; and in those days the tribe of Dan sought for itself an inheritance to inhabit, because no inheritance had fallen to it until that day in the midst of the tribes of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  002" id="18  002" >2</span>
 And the sons of Dan sent from their families five men of valour, from Saraa and from Esthaol, to spy out the land and to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   survey or examine it.  </span>  search it; and they said to them, Go and search out the land. And they came as far as the mount of Ephraim to the house of Michaias and they lodged there,  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  003" id="18  003" >3</span>
 in the house of Michaias, and they recognized the voice of the young man the Levite, and turned in there; and said to him, Who brought you in hither? and what do you in this place? and what have you here?  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  004" id="18  004" >4</span>
 And he said to them, Thus and thus did Michaias to me, and he hired me, and I became his priest.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  005" id="18  005" >5</span>
 And they said to him, Enquire now of God, and we shall know whether our way will prosper, on which we are going.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  006" id="18  006" >6</span>
 And the priest said to them, Go in peace; your way in which you° go,   is   before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  007" id="18  007" >7</span>
 And the five men went on, and came to Laisa; and they saw the people in the midst of it dwelling securely, at ease as   is   the manner of the Sidonians, and there is no one  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Here probably διατρέπων and ἐκπιέζων both come under the   Heb. מבליס and ἐκπιέζων and θησανροὺς   both under   עצר. </span>  perverting or shaming a matter in the land, no heir extorting treasures; and they are far from the Sidonians, and they have no intercourse with any one.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  008" id="18  008" >8</span>
 And the five men came to their brethren to Saraa and Esthaol, and said to their brethren, Why sit you° here   idle  ?  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  009" id="18  009" >9</span>
 And they said, Arise, and let us go up against them, for we have seen the land, and, behold,   it is   very good, yet you° are still: delay not to go, an to enter in to possess the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  010" id="18  010" >10</span>
 And whenever you° shall go, you° shall come in upon a people secure, and the land   is   extensive, for God has given it into your hand; a place where there is no lack of  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   of the things in the land or earth.  </span>  anything that the earth affords.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  011" id="18  011" >11</span>
 And there departed thence of the families of Dan, from Saraa and from Esthaol, six hundred men, girded with weapons of war.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  012" id="18  012" >12</span>
 And they went up, and encamped in Cariathiarim in Juda; therefore it was called in that place the camp of Dan, until this day: behold,   it is   behind Cariathiarim.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  013" id="18  013" >13</span>
 And they went on thence to the mount of Ephraim, and came to the house of Michaias.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  014" id="18  014" >14</span>
 And the five men who went to spy out the land of Laisa answered, and said to their brethren, You° know that there is in this place an ephod, and theraphin, and a graven and a molten image; and now consider what you° shall do.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  015" id="18  015" >15</span>
 And they turned aside there, and went into the house of the young man, the Levite,   even   into the house of Michaias, and asked him  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   as to or concerning peace.  </span>  how he was.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  016" id="18  016" >16</span>
 And the six hundred men of the sons of Dan who were girded with their weapons of war  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   standing.  </span>  stood by the door of the gate.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  017" id="18  017" >17</span>
 And the five men who went to spy out the land went up, and entered into the house of Michaias, and the priest stood.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  018" id="18  018" >18</span>
 And they took the graven image, and the ephod, and the theraphin, and the molten image; and the priest said to them, What are you° doing?  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  019" id="18  019" >19</span>
 And they said to him, Be silent, lay your hand upon your mouth, and come with us, and be to us a father and a priest:   is it   better for you to be the priest of the house of one man, or to be the priest of a tribe and house for a family of Israel?  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  020" id="18  020" >20</span>
 And the heart of the priest was glad, and he took the ephod, and the theraphin, and the graven image, and the molten image, and went in the midst of the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  021" id="18  021" >21</span>
 So they turned and departed, and put their children and their property and their baggage before them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  022" id="18  022" >22</span>
 They went some distance from the house of Michaias, and, behold, Michaias and the men in the houses near Michaias' house, cried out, and overtook the children of Dan.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  023" id="18  023" >23</span>
 And the children of Dan turned their face, and said to Michaias, What is the matter with you that you have cried out?  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  024" id="18  024" >24</span>
 And Michaias said, Because you° have taken my graven image which I made, and my priest, and are gone; and what have I remaining? and what   is   this   that   you° say to me, Why cry you?  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  025" id="18  025" >25</span>
 And the children of Dan said to him, Let not your voice be heard with us, lest angry men run upon you, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   add.   q.d.   to the deeds already done.  </span>  take away your life, and the lives of your house.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  026" id="18  026" >26</span>
 And the children of Dan went their way; and Michaias saw that they were stronger than himself, and he returned to his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  027" id="18  027" >27</span>
 And the children of Dan took what Michaias had made, and the priest that he had, and they came to Laisa, to a people quiet and secure; and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  028" id="18  028" >28</span>
 And there was no deliverer, because   the city   is far from the Sidonians, and they have no intercourse with men, and it   is   in the valley of the house of Raab; and they built the city, and lived in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  029" id="18  029" >29</span>
 And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel; and the name of the city was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb.

 And the children of Dan set up the graven image for themselves; and Jonathan son of Gerson son of Manasse, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan till the time of the carrying away of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   land.  </span>  nation.  <span class="verse" rel="v00718  031" id="18  031" >31</span>
 And they set up for themselves the graven image which Michaias made, all the days that the house of God was in Selom; and it was so in those days   that   there was no king in Israel.

<p><span class="chapter" id="19  001">19  </span> And there was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a man, a Levite.  </span>  a Levite sojourning in the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   thighs.  </span>  sides of mount Ephraim, and he took to himself a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a woman a concubine.  </span>  concubine from Bethleem Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  002" id="19  002" >2</span>
 And his concubine departed from him, and went away from him to the house of her father to Bethleem Juda, and she was there four months.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  003" id="19  003" >3</span>
 And her husband rose up, and went after her  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to speak to her heart.  </span>  to speak kindly to her, to recover her to himself; and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   his young man   was,   etc.  </span>  he had his young man with him, and a pair of asses; and she brought him into the house of her father; and the father of the damsel saw him, and was well pleased to meet him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  004" id="19  004" >4</span>
 And his father-in-law, the father of the damsel, constrained him, and he stayed with him for three days; and they ate and drank, and lodged there.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  005" id="19  005" >5</span>
 And it came to pass on the fourth day that they rose early, and he stood up to depart; and the father of the damsel said to his son-in-law, Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterwards you° shall go.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  006" id="19  006" >6</span>
 So they two sat down together and ate and drank: and the father of the damsel said to her husband, Tarry now the night, and let your heart be merry.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  007" id="19  007" >7</span>
 And the man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law constrained him, and he stayed and lodged there.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  008" id="19  008" >8</span>
 And he rose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the father of the damsel said, Strengthen now your heart, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Possibly,   prepare to march by the time the day declines.  </span>  quit yourself as a soldier till the day decline; and the two ate.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  009" id="19  009" >9</span>
 And the man rose up to depart, he and his concubine, and his young man; but his father-in-law the father of the damsel said to him, Behold now, the day has declined toward evening; lodge here, an let your heart rejoice; and you° shall rise early to-morrow for your journey, and you shall go to your habitation.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  010" id="19  010" >10</span>
 But the man would not lodge there, but he arose and departed, and came to the part opposite Jebus, (this is Jerusalem,) and   there was   with him a pair of asses saddled, and his concubine   was   with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  011" id="19  011" >11</span>
 And they came as far as Jebus: and the day had far advanced, and the young man said to his master, Come, I pray you, and let us turn aside to this city of the Jebusites, and let us lodge in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  012" id="19  012" >12</span>
 And his master said to him, We will not turn aside to a strange city, where there is not one of the children of Israel, but we will pass on as far as Gabaa.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  013" id="19  013" >13</span>
 And he said to his young man, Come, and let us draw near to one of the places, and we will lodge in Gabaa or in Rama.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  014" id="19  014" >14</span>
 And they passed by and went on, and the sun went down upon them near to Gabaa, which is in Benjamin.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  015" id="19  015" >15</span>
 And they turned aside thence to go in to lodge in Gabaa; and they went in, and sat down in the street of the city, and there was no one who conducted them into a house to lodge.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  016" id="19  016" >16</span>
 And behold, an old man came out of the field from his work in the evening; and the man was of mount Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gabaa, and the men of the place   were   sons of Benjamin.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  017" id="19  017" >17</span>
 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw a traveller in the street of the city; and the old man said to him, Whither go you, and whence come you?  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  018" id="19  018" >18</span>
 And he said to him, We are passing by from Bethleem Juda to the sides of mount Ephraim: I am from thence, and I went as far as Bethleem Juda, and I am going home, and there is no man to take me into his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  019" id="19  019" >19</span>
 Yet is there straw and food for our asses, and bread and wine for me and my handmaid and the young man with your servants; there is no lack of anything.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  020" id="19  020" >20</span>
 And the old man said, Peace   be   to you; only be every lack of your upon me, only do you by no means lodge in the street.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  021" id="19  021" >21</span>
 And he brought him into his house, and made room for his asses; and they washed their feet, and ate and drank.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  022" id="19  022" >22</span>
 And they   were   comforting their heart, when, behold, the men of the city, sons of transgressors, compassed the house, knocking at the door: and they spoke to the old man the owner of the house, saying, Bring out the man who came into your house, that we may know him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  023" id="19  023" >23</span>
 And the master of the house came out to them, and said, Nay, brethren, do not you° wrong, I pray you, after this man has come into my house; do not you° this folly.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  024" id="19  024" >24</span>
 Behold my daughter a virgin, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   his.  </span>  the man's concubine: I will bring them out, and humble you° them, and do to them that which is good in your eyes; but to this man do not  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the word or thing of this folly.   Hebraism. </span>  this folly.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  025" id="19  025" >25</span>
 But the men would not consent to listen to him; so the man laid hold of his concubine, and brought her out to them; and they knew her, and abused her all night till the morning, and let her go when the morning dawned.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  026" id="19  026" >26</span>
 And the woman came toward morning, and fell down at the door of the house where her husband was, until it was light.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  027" id="19  027" >27</span>
 And her husband rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went forth to go on his journey; and, behold, the woman his concubine had fallen down by the doors of the house, and her hands were on the threshold.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  028" id="19  028" >28</span>
 And he said to her, Rise, and let us go; and she answered not, for she was dead: and he took her upon his ass, and went to his place.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  029" id="19  029" >29</span>
 And he took his sword, and laid hold of his concubine, and divided her into twelve parts, and sent them to every coast of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00719  030" id="19  030" >30</span>
 And it was so, that every one who saw it said,   Such a day   as this has not happened nor has been seen from the day of the going up of the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt until this day: take you° counsel concerning it, and speak.

<p><span class="chapter" id="20  001">20  </span> And all the children of Israel went out, and all the congregation was gathered as one man, from Dan even to Bersabee, and in the land of Galaad, to the Lord at Massepha.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  002" id="20  002" >2</span>
 And all the tribes of Israel stood before the Lord in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  003" id="20  003" >3</span>
 And the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Massepha: and the children of Israel came and said, Tell us, where did this wickedness take place?  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  004" id="20  004" >4</span>
 And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I and my concubine went to Gabaa of Benjamin to lodge.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  005" id="20  005" >5</span>
 And the men of Gabaa rose up against me, and compassed the house by night against me; they wished to kill me, and they have humbled my concubine, and she is dead.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  006" id="20  006" >6</span>
 And I laid hold of my concubine, and divided her in pieces, and sent   the parts   into every coast of the inheritance of the children of Israel; for they have wrought lewdness and abomination in Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  007" id="20  007" >7</span>
 Behold, all you°   are   children of Israel; and consider and take counsel here among yourselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  008" id="20  008" >8</span>
 And all the people rose up as one man, saying, No one of us shall return to his tent, and no one of us shall return to his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  009" id="20  009" >9</span>
 And now this   is   the thing which shall be done in Gabaa; we will go up against it by lot.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  010" id="20  010" >10</span>
 Moreover we will take ten men for a hundred for all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred for a thousand, and a thousand for ten thousand, to take provision, to cause them to come to Gabaa of Benjamin, to do to it according to all the abomination, which  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. sons of Belial.  </span>  they wrought in Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  011" id="20  011" >11</span>
 And all the men of Israel were gathered to the city as one man.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  012" id="20  012" >12</span>
 And the tribes of Israel sent men through the whole tribe of Benjamin, saying, What   is   this wickedness that has been wrought among you?  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  013" id="20  013" >13</span>
 Now then give up the men the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   it,   sc.   Gabas.  </span>  sons of transgressors that are in Gabaa, and we will put them to death, and purge out wickedness from Israel: but the children of Benjamin consented not to listen to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  014" id="20  014" >14</span>
 And the children of Benjamin were gathered from their cities to Gabaa, to go forth to fight with the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  015" id="20  015" >15</span>
 And the children of Benjamin from their cities were numbered in that day, twenty-three thousand,   every   man drawing a sword, besides the inhabitants of Gabaa, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men of all the people,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See chap 3. 15.  </span>  able to use both hands alike;  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  016" id="20  016" >16</span>
 All these could sling with stones at a hair, and not miss.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  017" id="20  017" >17</span>
 And the men of Israel, exclusive of Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword; all these   were   men of war.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  018" id="20  018" >18</span>
 And they arose and went up to Baethel, and enquired of God: and the children of Israel said, Who shall go up for us first to fight with the children of Benjamin? And the Lord said, Juda shall go up first as leader.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  019" id="20  019" >19</span>
 And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gabaa.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  020" id="20  020" >20</span>
 And they went out, all the men of Israel, to fight with Benjamin, and engaged with them at Gabaa.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  021" id="20  021" >21</span>
 And the sons of Benjamin went forth from Gabaa, and they destroyed in Israel on that day two and twenty thousand men down to the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  022" id="20  022" >22</span>
 And the men of Israel  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   grew strong.  </span>  strengthened themselves, and again engaged in battle in the place where they had engaged on the first day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  023" id="20  023" >23</span>
 And the children of Israel went up, and wept before the Lord till evening, and enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall we again draw near to battle with our brethren the children of Benjamin? and the Lord said, Go up against them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  024" id="20  024" >24</span>
 And the children of Israel advanced against the children of Benjamin on the second day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  025" id="20  025" >25</span>
 And the children of Benjamin went forth to meet them from Gabaa on the second day, and destroyed of the children of Israel yet further eighteen thousand men down to the ground: all these drew sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  026" id="20  026" >26</span>
 And the children of Israel and all the people went up, and came to Baethel; and they wept, and sat there before the Lord; and they fasted on that day until evening, and offered whole burnt offerings and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   unblemished, according to the   Heb. peace offering.  </span>  perfect sacrifices, before the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  027" id="20  027" >27</span>
 for the ark of the Lord God   was   there in those days,  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  028" id="20  028" >28</span>
 and Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron stood before it in those days; and the children of Israel enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall we yet again go forth to fight with our brethren the sons of Benjamin? and the Lord said, Go up, to-morrow I will give them into your hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  029" id="20  029" >29</span>
 And the children of Israel set an ambush against Gabaa round about   it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  030" id="20  030" >30</span>
 And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and arrayed themselves against Gabaa as before.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  031" id="20  031" >31</span>
 And the children of Benjamin went out to meet the people, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   were emptied out of the city.  </span>  were all drawn out of the city, and began to strike and kill the people as before in the roads,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   which is one going up.  </span>  whereof one goes up to Baethel, and one to Gabaa in the field, about thirty men of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  032" id="20  032" >32</span>
 And the children of Benjamin said, They fall before us as at the first: but the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them out from the city into the roads; and they did so.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  033" id="20  033" >33</span>
 And all the men rose up out of their places, and engaged in Baal Thamar; and the liers in wait of Israel advanced from their place from  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. plain of the south.  </span>  Maraagabe.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  034" id="20  034" >34</span>
 And there came over against Gabaa ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel; and the fight   was   severe; and they knew not that evil  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   is coming upon them.  </span>  was coming upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  035" id="20  035" >35</span>
 And the Lord struck Benjamin before the children of Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin in that day a hundred and twenty-five thousand men: all these drew sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  036" id="20  036" >36</span>
 And the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck; and the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted in the ambuscade which they had prepared against Gabaa.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  037" id="20  037" >37</span>
 And when they retreated, then the liers in wait rose up, and they  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   extended themselves.  </span>  moved toward Gabaa, and the whole ambush came forth, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  038" id="20  038" >38</span>
 And the children of Israel had a signal of battle with the liers in wait, that they should send up a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   a concerted signal.  </span>  signal of smoke from the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  039" id="20  039" >39</span>
 And the children of Israel saw that the liers in wait had seized Gabaa, and they stood in line of battle; and Benjamin began to strike down  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   slain ones,   i.e.   to strike and cause to fall.  </span>  wounded ones among the men of Israel about thirty men; for they said, Surely they fall again before us,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   as the first battle was.  </span>  as in the first battle.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  040" id="20  040" >40</span>
 And the signal went up increasingly over the city as a pillar of smoke; and Benjamin looked behind him, and behold the destruction of the city went up to heaven.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  041" id="20  041" >41</span>
 And the men of Israel turned back, and the men of Benjamin hasted, because they saw that evil had come upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  042" id="20  042" >42</span>
 And they turned to the way of the wilderness from before the children of Israel, and fled: but the battle overtook them, and they from the cities destroyed them in the midst of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  043" id="20  043" >43</span>
 And they cut down Benjamin, and pursued him from Nua closely till they came opposite Gabaa on the east.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  044" id="20  044" >44</span>
 And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men: all these   were   men of might.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  045" id="20  045" >45</span>
 And the rest turned, and fled to the wilderness to the rock of Remmon; and the children of Israel  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   cut off as stragglers.   Gr.   gleaned,   or   picked straws.  </span>  picked off of them five thousand men; and the children of Israel went down after them as far as Gedan, and they struck of them two thousand men.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  046" id="20  046" >46</span>
 And all that fell of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men that drew sword in that day: all these were men of might.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  047" id="20  047" >47</span>
 And the rest turned, and fled to the wilderness to the rock of Remmon, even   six   hundred men; and they sojourned four months in the rock of Remmon.  <span class="verse" rel="v00720  048" id="20  048" >48</span>
 And the children of Israel returned to the children of Benjamin, and struck them with the edge of the sword from the city of Methla, even to the cattle, and every thing that was found in all the cities: and they burnt with fire the cities they found.

<p><span class="chapter" id="21  001">21  </span> Now the children of Israel swore in Massephath, saying, No man of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin for a wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v00721  002" id="21  002" >2</span>
 And the people came to Baethel, and sat there until evening before God: and they lifted up their voice and wept with a great weeping;  <span class="verse" rel="v00721  003" id="21  003" >3</span>

 And it came to pass on the morrow that the people rose up early, and built there an altar, and offered up whole burnt offerings and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See chap 20. 26.  </span>  peace offerings.  <span class="verse" rel="v00721  005" id="21  005" >5</span>
 And the children of Israel said, Who of all the tribes of Israel, went not up in the congregation to the Lord? for there was a great oath concerning those who went not up to the Lord to Massephath, saying, He shall surely be put to death.  <span class="verse" rel="v00721  006" id="21  006" >6</span>

 What shall we do for wives for the rest that remain? whereas we have sworn by the Lord, not to give them of our daughters for wives.  <span class="verse" rel="v00721  008" id="21  008" >8</span>
 And they said, What one   man is there   of the tribes of Israel, who went not up to the Lord to Massephath? and, behold, no man came to the camp from Jabis Galaad to the assembly.  <span class="verse" rel="v00721  009" id="21  009" >9</span>

 And all the congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin in the rock Remmon, and invited them to   make   peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v00721  014" id="21  014" >14</span>
 And Benjamin returned to the children of Israel at that time, and the children of Israel gave them the women whom they   had   save alive of the daughters of Jabis Galaad; and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   it pleased them thus.  </span>  they were content.  <span class="verse" rel="v00721  015" id="21  015" >15</span>
 And the people  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   See ver. 6.  </span>  relented for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00721  016" id="21  016" >16</span>
 And the elders of the congregation said, What shall we do for wives for them that remain? for the women have been destroyed out of Benjamin.  <span class="verse" rel="v00721  017" id="21  017" >17</span>
 And they said,   There must be   an inheritance of them that are escaped of Benjamin; and   so   a tribe shall not be destroyed out of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00721  018" id="21  018" >18</span>
 For we shall not be able to give them wives of our daughters, because we swore among the children of Israel, saying, Cursed   is   he that gives a wife to Benjamin.  <span class="verse" rel="v00721  019" id="21  019" >19</span>
 And they said, Behold! now   there is   a feast of the Lord  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from days to days.   Hebraism. </span>  from year to year in Selom, which is on the north of Baethel, eastward on the way that goes up from Baethel to Sychem, and from the south of Lebona.  <span class="verse" rel="v00721  020" id="21  020" >20</span>
 And they charged the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;  <span class="verse" rel="v00721  021" id="21  021" >21</span>
 and you° shall see; and behold! if there come out the daughters of the inhabitants of Selom to dance in dances, then shall you° go out of the vineyards and seize for yourselves every man a wife of the daughters of Selom, and go you° into the land of Benjamin.  <span class="verse" rel="v00721  022" id="21  022" >22</span>
 And it shall come to pass, when their fathers or their brethren come to dispute with us, that we will say to them, Grant them freely to us, for we have not taken every man his wife in the battle: because you° did not give to them  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Translated from   Alex. </span>  according to the occasion, you° transgressed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00721  023" id="21  023" >23</span>
 And the children of Benjamin did so; and they took wives according to their number from the dancers whom they seized: and they went and returned to their inheritance, and built the cities, and lived in them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00721  024" id="21  024" >24</span>
 And the children of Israel  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   walked  </span>  went thence at that time every man to his tribe and his kindred; and they went thence every man to his inheritance.  <span class="verse" rel="v00721  025" id="21  025" >25</span>
 And in those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own sight.
