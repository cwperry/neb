<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">A</span>nd Solomon the son of David was established over his kingdom, and the Lord his God was with him, and increased him exceedingly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0141  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands, and to the captains of hundreds, and to the judges, and to all the rulers over Israel, even the heads of the families;  <span class="verse" rel="v0141  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 and Solomon and all the congregation went to the high place that was in Gabaon, where was God's tabernacle of witness, which Moses the servant of the Lord made in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0141  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 But David had brought up the ark of God out of the city of Cariathiarim; for David had prepared a place for it, for he had pitched a tabernacle for it in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0141  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 And the brazen altar which Beseleel the son of Urias, the son of Or, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the Lord: and Solomon and the congregation enquired at it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0141  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 And Solomon brought   victims   there to the brazen altar that was before the Lord in the tabernacle, and offered upon it a thousand whole burnt offerings.  <span class="verse" rel="v0141  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, Ask what I shall give you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0141  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 And Solomon said to God, You have dealt very mercifully with my father David, and have made me king in his stead.  <span class="verse" rel="v0141  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 And now, O Lord God, let, I pray you, your name be established upon David my father; for you have made me king over a people numerous as the dust of the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0141  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 Now give me wisdom and understanding, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who shall judge this your great people?  <span class="verse" rel="v0141  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked great wealth, nor glory, nor the life of your enemies, and you have not asked long life; but have asked for yourself wisdom and understanding, that you might judge my people, over whom I have made you king:  <span class="verse" rel="v0141  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 I give you this wisdom and understanding; and I will give you wealth, and riches, and glory, so that there shall not have been   any   like you among the kings before you, neither shall there be such after you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0141  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 And Solomon came from the high place that was in Gabaon to Jerusalem,   from   before the tabernacle of witness, and reigned over Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0141  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 And Solomon collected chariots and horsemen: and he had fourteen hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen: and he set them in the cities of chariots, and the people   were   with the king in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0141  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 And the king made silver and gold in Jerusalem   to be   as stones, and cedars in Judea as sycamores in the plain for multitude.  <span class="verse" rel="v0141  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 And Solomon imported horses from Egypt, and the charge of the king's merchants for going   was as follows  , and they traded,  <span class="verse" rel="v0141  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 and went and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred   pieces   of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty   pieces   of silver: and so they brought for all the kings of the Chettites, and for the kings of Syria by their means.  
<!-- 2   017 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> And Solomon said that he would build a house to the name of the Lord, and a house for his kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0142  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 And Solomon gathered seventy thousand men that bore burdens, and eighty thousand hewers of stone in the mountain, and   there were   three thousand six hundred superintendents over them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0142  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 And Solomon sent to Chiram king of Tyre, saying, Whereas you did deal   favourably   with David my father, and did send him cedars to build for himself a house to dwell in,  <span class="verse" rel="v0142  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 behold, I also his son am building a house to the name of the Lord my God, to consecrate it to him, to burn incense before him, and   to offer   show bread continually, and to offer up whole burnt offerings continually morning and evening, and on the sabbaths, and at the new moons, and at the feasts of the Lord our God: this   is   a perpetual   statute   for Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0142  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 And the house which I am building   is to be   great: for the Lord our God   is   great beyond all gods.  <span class="verse" rel="v0142  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 And who will be able to build him a house? for the heaven and heaven of heavens do not bear his glory: and who am I, that I should build him a house, save only to burn incense before him?  <span class="verse" rel="v0142  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 And now send me a man wise and skilled to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and in scarlet, and in blue, and one that knows how to grave together with the craftsmen who are with me in Juda and in Jerusalem, which materials my father David prepared.  <span class="verse" rel="v0142  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 And send me from Libanus cedar wood, and wood of juniper, and pine; for I know that your servants are skilled in cutting timber in Libanus: and, behold, your servants shall go with my servants,  <span class="verse" rel="v0142  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 to prepare timber for me in abundance: for the house which I am building   must be   great and glorious.  <span class="verse" rel="v0142  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 And, behold, I have given freely to your servants that work and cut the wood, corn for food,   even   twenty thousand measures of wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand measures of wine, and twenty thousand measures of oil.  <span class="verse" rel="v0142  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 And Chiram king of Tyre answered in writing, and sent to Solomon, saying, Because the Lord loved his people, he made you king over them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0142  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 And Chiram said, Blessed   be   the Lord God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given to king David a wise son, and one endowed with knowledge and understanding, who shall build a house for the Lord, and a house for his kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0142  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 And now I have sent you a wise and understanding man   who belonged   to Chiram my father  <span class="verse" rel="v0142  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 (his mother   was   of the daughters of Dan, and his father   was   a Tyrian), skilled to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in stones and wood; and to weave with purple, and blue, and fine linen, and scarlet; and to engrave, and to understand every device, whatever you shall give him   to do   with your craftsmen, and the craftsmen of my lord David your father.  <span class="verse" rel="v0142  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 And now, the wheat, and the barley, and the oil, and the wine which my lord mentioned, let him send to his servants.  <span class="verse" rel="v0142  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 And we will cut timber out of Libanus according to all your need, and we will bring it on rafts to the sea of Joppa, and you shall bring it to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0142  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 And Solomon gathered all the foreigners that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father numbered them; and there were found a hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred.  <span class="verse" rel="v0142  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 And he made of them seventy thousand burden-bearers, and eighty thousand hewers of stone, and three thousand six hundred taskmasters over the people.  
<!-- 3   018 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> And Solomon began to build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem in the mount of Amoria, where the Lord appeared to his father David, in the place which David had prepared in the threshing floor of Orna the Jebusite.  <span class="verse" rel="v0143  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 And he began to build in the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.  <span class="verse" rel="v0143  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 And thus Solomon began to build the house of God: the length in cubits—even the first measurement from end to end, was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v0143  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 And the portico in front of the house, its length in front of the breadth of the house   was   twenty cubits, and its height a hundred and twenty cubits: and he gilded it within with pure gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v0143  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 And he lined the great house with cedar wood, and gilded it with pure gold, and carved upon it palm-trees and chains.  <span class="verse" rel="v0143  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty; and he gilded it with gold of the gold from Pharuim.  <span class="verse" rel="v0143  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 And he gilded the house, and its   inner   walls, and the door-posts, and the roofs, and the doors with gold; and he carved cherubs on the walls.  <span class="verse" rel="v0143  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 And he built the holy of holies, its length was according to the front   of the other house  , the breadth of the house   was   twenty cubits, and the length twenty cubits: and he gilded   it   with pure gold for cherubs, to   the amount of   six hundred talents.  <span class="verse" rel="v0143  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 And the weight of the nails,   even   the weight of each was fifty shekels of gold: and he gilded the upper chamber with gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v0143  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 And he made two cherubs in the most holy house, wood-work, and he gilded them with gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v0143  11-12" id="3  11-12" >11-12</span>
 And the wings of the cherubs were twenty cubits in length: and one wing of five cubits touched the wall of the house: and the other wing of five cubits touched the wing of the other cherub.  <span class="verse" rel="v0143  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 And the wings of these cherubs expanded were of the length of twenty cubits: and they stood upon their feet, and their faces were toward the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0143  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and wove cherubs in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0143  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 Also he made in front of the house two pillars, in height thirty-five cubits, and their chapters of five cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v0143  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 And he made chains,   as   in the oracle, and put   them   on the heads of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.  <span class="verse" rel="v0143  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 And he set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right hand and the other on the left: and he called the name of the one on the right hand 'Stability,' and the name of the one on the left 'Strength.'  
<!-- 4   017 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> And he made a brazen altar, the length of it twenty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits, and the height ten cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 And he made the molten sea, in diameter ten cubits, entirely round, and the height of it five cubits, and the circumference thirty cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 And beneath it the likeness of calves, they compass it round about: ten cubits compass the laver round about, they cast the calves two rows in their casting,  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 wherein they made them twelve calves, —three looking northwards, and three westwards, and three southwards, and three eastwards: and the sea was upon them above,   and   their hinder parts were inward.  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  005" id="4  005" >5</span>
 And its thickness was a hand-breadth, and its brim as the brim of a cup, graven with flowers of lilies, holding three thousand measures: and he finished   it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 And he made ten lavers, and set five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them the instruments of the whole burnt offerings, and to rinse   the vessels   in them; and the sea   was   for the priests to wash in.  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 And he made the ten golden candlesticks according to their pattern, and he put them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 And he made ten tables, and put them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left: and he made a hundred golden bowls.  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 Also he made the priests' court, and the great court, and doors to the court, and their panels   were   overlaid with brass.  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 And he set the sea at the corner of the house on the right, as it were fronting the east.  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 And Chiram made the flesh hooks, and the fire-pans, and the grate of the altar, and all its instruments: and Chiram finished doing all the work which he wrought for king Solomon in the house of God:  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 two pillars, and upon them an embossed work for the chapiters on the heads of the two pillars, and two nets to cover the heads of the chapiters which are on the heads of the pillars;  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 and four hundred golden bells for the two nets, and two rows of pomegranates in each net, to cover the two embossed rims of the chapiters which are upon the pillars.  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  014" id="4  014" >14</span>
 And he made the ten bases, and he made the lavers upon the bases;  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  015" id="4  015" >15</span>
 and the one sea, and the twelve calves under it;  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  016" id="4  016" >16</span>
 and the foot-baths, and the buckets, and the caldrons, and the flesh hooks, and all their furniture (which Chiram made, and brought to king Solomon in the house of the Lord) of pure brass.  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  017" id="4  017" >17</span>
 In the country round about Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground in the house of Socchoth, and between   that and   Saredatha.  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  018" id="4  018" >18</span>
 So Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance, for the quantity of brass failed not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  019" id="4  019" >19</span>
 And Solomon made all the vessels of the house of the Lord, and the golden altar, and the tables, and upon them   were to be   the loaves of show bread;  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  020" id="4  020" >20</span>
 also the candlesticks, and the lamps to give light according to the pattern, and in front of the oracle, of pure gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  021" id="4  021" >21</span>
 And their snuffers, and their lamps   were made  , and   he made   the bowls, and the censers, and the fire-pans, of pure gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v0144  022" id="4  022" >22</span>
 And   there was   the inner door of the house   opening   into the holy of holies, and   he made   the inner doors of the temple of gold. So all the work which Solomon wrought for the house of the Lord was finished.

<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> And Solomon brought in the holy things of his father David, the silver, and the gold, and the   other   vessels, and put them in the treasury of the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0145  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 Then Solomon assembled all the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes,   even   the leaders of the families of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, —this   is   Sion.  <span class="verse" rel="v0145  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 And all Israel were assembled   to   the king in the feast, this   is   the seventh month.  <span class="verse" rel="v0145  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 And all the elders of Israel came; and all the Levites took up the ark,  <span class="verse" rel="v0145  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 and the tabernacle of witness, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle; and the priests and the Levites brought it up.  <span class="verse" rel="v0145  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 And king Solomon, and all the elders of Israel, and the religious of them, and they of them that were gathered before the ark,   were   sacrificing calves and sheep, which could not be numbered or reckoned for multitude.  <span class="verse" rel="v0145  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord into its place, into the oracle of the house,   even   into the holy of holies, under the wings of the cherubs.  <span class="verse" rel="v0145  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 And the cherubs stretched out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubs covered the ark, and its staves above.  <span class="verse" rel="v0145  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 And the staves projected, and the heads of the staves were seen from the holy place in front of the oracle, they were not seen without: and there they were to this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0145  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 There was nothing in the ark except the two tables which Moses placed   there   in Choreb, which God gave in covenant with the children of Israel, when they went out of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v0145  011" id="5  011" >11</span>
 And it came to pass, when the priests when out of the holy place, (for all the priests that were found were sanctified, they were not   then   arranged according to their daily course,)  <span class="verse" rel="v0145  012" id="5  012" >12</span>
 that all the singing Levites   assigned   to the sons of Asaph, to Aeman, to Idithun, and to his sons, and to his brethren, of them that were clothed in linen garments, with cymbals and lutes and harps,   were   standing before the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests, blowing trumpets.  <span class="verse" rel="v0145  013" id="5  013" >13</span>
 And there was one voice in the trumpeting and in the psalm-singing, and in the loud utterance with one voice to give thanks and praise the Lord; and when they raised their voice together with trumpets and cymbals, and instruments of music, and said, Give thanks to the Lord, for   it is   good, for his mercy   endures   for ever:—then the house was filled with the cloud of the glory of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0145  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 And the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord filled the house of God.

<p><span class="chapter" id="6  001">6  </span> Then said Solomon, The Lord said that he would dwell in thick darkness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  002" id="6  002" >2</span>
 But I have built a house to your name, holy to you, and prepared   for you   to dwell in for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  003" id="6  003" >3</span>
 And the king turned his face, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood by.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  004" id="6  004" >4</span>
 And he said, Blessed   be   the Lord God of Israel: he has even fulfilled with his hands as he spoke with his mouth to my father David, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  005" id="6  005" >5</span>
 From the day when I brought up my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city of all the tribes of Israel, to build a house that my name should be there; neither did I choose a man to be a leader over my people Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  006" id="6  006" >6</span>
 But I chose Jerusalem that my name should be there; and I chose David to be over my people Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  007" id="6  007" >7</span>
 And it came into the heart of David my father, to build a house for the name of the Lord God of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  008" id="6  008" >8</span>
 But the Lord said to my father David, Whereas it came into your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it came into your heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  009" id="6  009" >9</span>
 Nevertheless you shall not build the house; for your son who shall come forth out of your loins, he shall build the house for my name.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  010" id="6  010" >10</span>
 And the Lord has confirmed this word, which he spoke; and I am raised up in the room of my father David, and I sit upon the throne of Israel as the Lord said, and I have built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel:  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  011" id="6  011" >11</span>
 and I have set there the ark in which   is   the covenant of the Lord, which he made with Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  012" id="6  012" >12</span>
 And he stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread out his hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  013" id="6  013" >13</span>
 For Solomon   had   made a brazen scaffold, and set it in the midst of the court of the sanctuary; the length of it   was   five cubits, and the breadth of it five cubits, and the height of it three cubits: and he stood upon it, and fell upon his knees before the whole congregation of Israel, and spread abroad his hands to heaven,  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  014" id="6  014" >14</span>
 and said, Lord God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven, or on the earth; keeping covenant and mercy with your servants that walk before you with   their   whole heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  015" id="6  015" >15</span>
 Even as you have kept   them   with your servant David my father, as you have spoken to him in words:—you have both spoken with your mouth, and have fulfilled   it   with your hands, as it is this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  016" id="6  016" >16</span>
 and now, Lord God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father the things which you spoke to him, saying, There shall not fail you a man before me sitting on the throne of Israel, if only your sons will take heed to their way to walk in my law, as you did walk before me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  017" id="6  017" >17</span>
 And now, Lord God of Israel, let, I pray you, your word be confirmed, which you have spoken to your servant David.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  018" id="6  018" >18</span>
 For will God indeed dwell with men upon the earth? if the heaven and the heaven of heavens will not suffice you, what then is this house which I have built?  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  019" id="6  019" >19</span>
 Yet you shall have respect to the prayer of your servant, and to my petition, O Lord God, so as to listen to the petition and the prayer which your servant prays before you this day:  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  020" id="6  020" >20</span>
 so that your eyes should be open over this house by day and by night, towards this place, whereon you said your name should be called, so as to hear the prayer which your servant prays towards this house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  021" id="6  021" >21</span>
 And you shall hear the supplication of your servant, and of your people Israel, whatever prayers they shall make towards this place: and you shall listen in your dwelling-place out of heaven, yes you shall hear, and be merciful.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  022" id="6  022" >22</span>
 If a man sin against his neighbor, and he bring an oath upon him so as to make him swear, and he come and swear before the altar in this house;  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  023" id="6  023" >23</span>
 then shall you listen out of heaven, and do, and judge your servants, to recompense the transgressor, and to return his ways upon his head: and to justify the righteous, to recompense him according to his righteousness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  024" id="6  024" >24</span>
 And if your people Israel should be put to the worse before the enemy, if they should sin against you, and   then   turn and confess to your name, and pray and make supplication before you in this house;  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  025" id="6  025" >25</span>
 then shall you listen out of heaven and shall be merciful to the sins of your people Israel, and you shall restore them to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  026" id="6  026" >26</span>
 When heaven is restrained, and there is no rain, because they shall have sinned against you, and   when   they shall pray towards this place, and praise your name, and shall turn from their sins, because you shall afflict them;  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  027" id="6  027" >27</span>
 then shall you listen from heaven, and you shall be merciful to the sins of your servants, and of your people Israel; for you shall show them the good way in which they shall walk; and you shall send rain upon your land, which you gave to your people for an inheritance.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  028" id="6  028" >28</span>
 If there should be famine upon the land, if there should be death, a pestilent wind an blight; if there should be locust and caterpiller, and if the enemy should harass them before their cities: in whatever plague and whatever distress   they may be  ;  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  029" id="6  029" >29</span>
 Then whatever prayer and whatever supplication shall be made by any man and all your people Israel, if a man should know his own plague and his own sickness, and should spread forth his hands toward this house;  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  030" id="6  030" >30</span>
 then shall you hear from heaven, out of your prepared dwelling-place, and shall be merciful, and shall recompense to the man according to his ways, as you shall know his heart   to be  ; for you alone know the heart of the children of men:  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  031" id="6  031" >31</span>
 that they may reverence all your ways all the days which they live upon the face of the land, which you gave to our fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  032" id="6  032" >32</span>
 And every stranger who is not himself of your people Israel, and who shall have come from a distant land because of your great name, and your mighty hand, and your high arm; when they shall come and worship toward this place; —  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  033" id="6  033" >33</span>
 then shall you listen out of heaven, out of your prepared dwelling-place, and shall do according to all that the stranger shall call upon you for; that all the nations of the earth may know your name, and that they may fear you, as your people Israel   do  , and that they may know that your name is called upon this house which I have built.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  034" id="6  034" >34</span>
 And if your people shall go forth to war against their enemies by the way by which you shall send them, and shall pray to you toward this city which you have chosen, and   toward   the house which I have built to your name;  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  035" id="6  035" >35</span>
 then shall you hear out of heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  036" id="6  036" >36</span>
 Whereas if they shall sin against you, (for there is no man who will not sin,) and you shall strike them, and deliver them up before their enemies, and they that take them captive shall carry them away into a land of enemies, to a land far off or near;  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  037" id="6  037" >37</span>
 and   if   they shall repent in their land whither they were carried captive, and shall also turn and make supplication to you in their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have transgressed, we have wrought unrighteously;  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  038" id="6  038" >38</span>
 and   if   they shall turn to you with all their heart and all their soul in the land of them that carried them captives, whither they carried them captives, and shall pray toward their land which you gave to their fathers, and the city which you did choose, and the house which I built to your name:—  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  039" id="6  039" >39</span>
 then shall you hear out of heaven, out of your prepared dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplication, and you shall execute justice, and shall be merciful to your people that sin against you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  040" id="6  040" >40</span>
 And now, Lord, let, I pray you, your eyes be opened, and your ears be attentive to the petition   made in   this place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  041" id="6  041" >41</span>
 And now, O Lord God, arise into your resting-place, you, and the ark of your strength: let your priests, O Lord God, clothe themselves with salvation, and your sons rejoice in prosperity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0146  042" id="6  042" >42</span>
 O Lord God, turn not away the face of your anointed: remember the mercies of your servant David.

<p><span class="chapter" id="7  001">7  </span> And when Solomon had finished praying, then the fire came down from heaven, and devoured the whole burnt offerings and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0147  002" id="7  002" >2</span>
 And the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord at that time, for the glory of the Lord filled the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0147  003" id="7  003" >3</span>
 And all the children of Israel saw the fire descending, and the glory of the Lord was upon the house: and they fell upon their face to the ground on the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the Lord; for   it is   good   to do so  , because his mercy   endures   for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0147  004" id="7  004" >4</span>
 And the king and all the people   were   offering sacrifices before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0147  005" id="7  005" >5</span>
 And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of calves twenty and two thousand, of sheep a hundred and twenty thousand: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0147  006" id="7  006" >6</span>
 And the priests were standing at their watches, and the Levites with instruments of music of the Lord, belonging to king David, to give thanks before the Lord, for his mercy   endures   for ever, with the hymns of David, by their ministry: and the priests were blowing the trumpets before them, and all Israel standing.  <span class="verse" rel="v0147  007" id="7  007" >7</span>
 And Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was in the house of the Lord: for he offered there the whole burnt offerings and the fat of the peace-offerings, for the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not sufficient to receive the whole burnt offerings, and the meat-offerings, and the fat.  <span class="verse" rel="v0147  008" id="7  008" >8</span>
 And Solomon kept the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entering in of Aemath, and as far as the river of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v0147  009" id="7  009" >9</span>
 And on the eighth day he kept a solemn assembly: for he kept a feast of seven days as the dedication of the altar.  <span class="verse" rel="v0147  010" id="7  010" >10</span>
 And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he dismissed the people to their tents, rejoicing, and with a glad heart because of the good deeds which the Lord had done to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0147  011" id="7  011" >11</span>
 So Solomon finished the house of the Lord, and the king's house: and in whatever Solomon wished in his heart to do in the house of the Lord and in his own house, he prospered.  <span class="verse" rel="v0147  012" id="7  012" >12</span>
 And the Lord appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, I have heard your prayer, and I have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.  <span class="verse" rel="v0147  013" id="7  013" >13</span>

 then if my people, on whom my name is called, should repent, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their evil ways, I also will hear from heaven, and I will be merciful to their sins, and I will heal their land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0147  015" id="7  015" >15</span>
 And now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive to the prayer of this place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0147  016" id="7  016" >16</span>
 And now I have chosen and sanctified this house, that my name should be there for ever: and my eyes and my heart shall be there always.  <span class="verse" rel="v0147  017" id="7  017" >17</span>

 then will I establish the throne of your kingdom, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, There shall not fail you a man ruling in Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0147  019" id="7  019" >19</span>
 But if you° should turn away, and forsake my ordinances and my commandments, which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods, and worship them;  <span class="verse" rel="v0147  020" id="7  020" >20</span>
 then will I remove you from the land which I gave them; and this house which I have consecrated to my name I will remove out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0147  021" id="7  021" >21</span>
 And   as for   this lofty house, every one that passes by it shall be amazed, and shall say, Therefore has the Lord done   thus   to this land, and to this house?  <span class="verse" rel="v0147  022" id="7  022" >22</span>
 And   men   shall say, Because they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they attached themselves to other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: and therefore he has brought upon them all this evil.

<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> And it came to pass after twenty years, in which Solomon built the house of the Lord, and his own house,  <span class="verse" rel="v0148  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 that Solomon rebuilt the cities which Chiram had given to Solomon, and caused the children of Israel to dwell in them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0148  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 And Solomon came to Baesoba, and fortified it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0148  004" id="8  004" >4</span>
 And he built Thoedmor in the wilderness, and all the strong cities which he built in Emath.  <span class="verse" rel="v0148  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 And he built Baethoron the upper, and Baethoron the lower, strong cities, —they had walls, gates, and bars;  <span class="verse" rel="v0148  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 and Balaath, and all the strong cities which Solomon had, and all his chariot cities, and cities of horsemen, and all things that Solomon desired according to his desire of building, in Jerusalem, and in Libanus, and in all his kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0148  007" id="8  007" >7</span>
    As for   all the people that was left of the Chettites, and the Amorites, and the Pherezites, and the Evites, and the Jebusites, who are not of Israel,  <span class="verse" rel="v0148  008" id="8  008" >8</span>
 but were of the children of them whom the children Israel destroyed not, that were left after them in the land, even them did Solomon make tributaries to this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0148  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 But Solomon did not make any of the children of Israel servants in his kingdom; for, behold,   they were   warriors and rulers, and mighty   men  , and captains of chariots and horsemen.  <span class="verse" rel="v0148  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 And these are the chiefs of the officers of king Solomon, two hundred and fifty overseeing the work among the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0148  011" id="8  011" >11</span>
 And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharao from the city of David to the house which he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the city of David, the king of Israel, for   the place   is holy into which the ark of the Lord has entered.  <span class="verse" rel="v0148  012" id="8  012" >12</span>
 Then Solomon offered up to the Lord whole burnt offerings on the altar which he had built to the Lord before the temple,  <span class="verse" rel="v0148  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 according to the daily rate, to offer up   sacrifices   according to the commandments of Moses, on the sabbaths, and at the new moons, and at the feasts, three times in the year, at the feast of unleavened bread, and at the feast of weeks, and at the feast of tabernacles.  <span class="verse" rel="v0148  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 And he established, according to the order of his father David, the courses of the priests, and   that   according to their public ministrations: and the Levites   were appointed   over their charges, to praise and minister before the priests according to the daily order: and the porters were appointed according to their courses to the different gates: for thus   were   the commandments of David the man of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0148  015" id="8  015" >15</span>
 They transgressed not the commandments of the king concerning the priests and the Levites with regard to everything else, and with regard to the treasures.  <span class="verse" rel="v0148  016" id="8  016" >16</span>
 Now all the work had been prepared from the day when the foundation was laid, until Solomon finished the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0148  017" id="8  017" >17</span>
 Then Solomon went to Gasion Gaber, and to Aelath near the sea in the land of Idumea.  <span class="verse" rel="v0148  018" id="8  018" >18</span>
 And Chiram sent by the hand of his servants ships, and servants skilled in naval affairs; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Sophira, and brought thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and they came to king Solomon.

 And Solomon told her all her words; and there passed not a word from Solomon which he told her not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  003" id="9  003" >3</span>
 And the queen of Saba saw the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he had built,  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  004" id="9  004" >4</span>
 and the meat of the tables, and the sitting of his servants, and the standing of his ministers, and their raiment; and his cupbearers, and their apparel; and the whole burnt offerings which he offered up in the house of the Lord; then she was in ecstasy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  005" id="9  005" >5</span>

 Yet I believed not the reports until I came, and my eyes saw: and, behold, the half of the abundance of your wisdom was not told me: you have exceeded the report which I heard.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 Blessed   are   your men, blessed   are   these your servants, who stand before you continually, and hear your wisdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 Blessed be the Lord your God, who took pleasure in you, to set you upon his throne for a king, to the Lord your God: forasmuch as the Lord your God loved Israel to establish them for ever, therefore he has set you over them for a king to execute judgment and justice.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in very great abundance, and precious stones: and there were not   any where else   such spices as those which the queen of Saba gave king Solomon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  010" id="9  010" >10</span>
 And the servants of Solomon and the servants of Chiram brought gold to Solomon out of Suphir, and pine timber, and precious stones.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  011" id="9  011" >11</span>
 And the king made of the pine timber steps to the house of the Lord, and to the king's house, and harps and lutes for the singers: and such were not seen before in the land of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  012" id="9  012" >12</span>
 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Saba all that she requested, besides all that she brought to king Solomon: and she returned to her   own   land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  013" id="9  013" >13</span>
 And the weight of the gold that was brought to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  014" id="9  014" >14</span>
 besides what the men who were regularly appointed and the merchants brought, and all the kings of Arabia and princes of the land: all brought gold and silver to king Solomon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  015" id="9  015" >15</span>
 And king Solomon made two hundred shields of beaten gold: there were six hundred   shekels   of pure gold to one shield.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  016" id="9  016" >16</span>
 And three hundred buckles of beaten gold:   the weight   of three hundred gold shekels went to one buckler: and the king placed them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  017" id="9  017" >17</span>
 And the king made a great throne of ivory, and he gilded it with pure gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  018" id="9  018" >18</span>
 And   there were   six steps to the throne, riveted with gold, and elbows on either side of the seat of the throne, and two lions standing by the elbows:  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  019" id="9  019" >19</span>
 and twelve lions standing there on the six steps on each side. There was not the like in any   other   kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  020" id="9  020" >20</span>
 And all king Solomon's vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were covered with gold: silver was not thought anything of in the days of Solomon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  021" id="9  021" >21</span>
 For a ship went for the king to Tharsis with the servants of Chiram: once every three years came vessels from Tharsis to the king, laden with gold, and silver, and ivory, and apes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  022" id="9  022" >22</span>
 And Solomon exceeded all   other   kings both in riches and wisdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  023" id="9  023" >23</span>
 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  024" id="9  024" >24</span>
 And they brought every one his gifts, silver vessels and golden vessels, and raiment, myrrh and spices, horses and mules, a rate every year.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  025" id="9  025" >25</span>
 And Solomon had four thousand mares for chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and he put them in the chariot cities, and with the king in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  026" id="9  026" >26</span>
 And he rules over all the kings from the river even to the land of the Philistines, and to the borders of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  027" id="9  027" >27</span>
 And the king made gold and silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars as the sycamore trees in the plain for abundance.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  028" id="9  028" >28</span>
 And Solomon imported horses from Egypt, and from every   other   country.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  029" id="9  029" >29</span>
 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, the first and the last, behold, these are written in the words of Nathan the prophet, and in the words of Achia the Selonite, and in the visions of Joel the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nabat.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  030" id="9  030" >30</span>
 And Solomon reigned over all Israel forty years.  <span class="verse" rel="v0149  031" id="9  031" >31</span>
 And Solomon fell asleep, and they buried him in the city of David his father: and Roboam his son reigned in his stead.  
<!-- 10   031 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="10  001">10  </span> And Roboam came to Sychem: for all Israel came to Sychem to make him king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01410  002" id="10  002" >2</span>
 And it came to pass when Jeroboam the son of Nabat heard   it  , (now he was in Egypt, forasmuch as he had fled there from the face of king Solomon, and Jeroboam lived in Egypt,) that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v01410  003" id="10  003" >3</span>
 And they sent and called him: and Jeroboam and all the congregation came to Roboam, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01410  004" id="10  004" >4</span>
 Your father made our yoke grievous: now then abate   somewhat   of your father's grievous rule, and of his heavy yoke which he put upon us, and we will serve you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01410  005" id="10  005" >5</span>
 And he said to them, Go away for three days, and   then   come to me. So the people departed.  <span class="verse" rel="v01410  006" id="10  006" >6</span>
 And king Roboam assembled the elders that stood before his father Solomon in his life-time, saying, How do you° counsel   me   to return an answer to this people?  <span class="verse" rel="v01410  007" id="10  007" >7</span>
 And they spoke to him, saying, If you would this day befriend this people, and be kind to them, and speak to them good words, then will they be your servants for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v01410  008" id="10  008" >8</span>
 But he forsook the advice of the old men, who took counsel with him, and he took counsel with the young men who had been brought up with him, who stood before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01410  009" id="10  009" >9</span>
 And he said to them, What do you° advise that I should answer this people, who spoke to me, saying, Ease   somewhat   of the yoke which your father laid upon us?  <span class="verse" rel="v01410  010" id="10  010" >10</span>
 And the young men that had been brought up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shall you speak to the people that spoke to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, and do you lighten   somewhat of it   from us; thus shall you say, My little finger   shall be   thicker than my father's loins.  <span class="verse" rel="v01410  011" id="10  011" >11</span>
 And whereas my father chastised you with a heavy yoke, I will also add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, and I will chastise you with scorpions.  <span class="verse" rel="v01410  012" id="10  012" >12</span>
 And Jeroboam and all the people came to Roboam on the third day, as the king had spoken, saying, Return to me on the third day.  <span class="verse" rel="v01410  013" id="10  013" >13</span>
 And the king answered harshly; and king Roboam forsook the counsel of the old men,  <span class="verse" rel="v01410  014" id="10  014" >14</span>
 and spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.  <span class="verse" rel="v01410  015" id="10  015" >15</span>
 And the king listened not to the people, for there was a change   of their minds   from God, saying, The Lord has confirmed his word, which he spoke by the hand of Achia the Selonite concerning Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and   concerning   all Israel;  <span class="verse" rel="v01410  016" id="10  016" >16</span>
 for the king did not listen to them. And the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David, or inheritance in the son of Jessae? to your tents, O Israel: now see to your own house, David. So all Israel went to their tents.  <span class="verse" rel="v01410  017" id="10  017" >17</span>
 But the men of Israel, even those who lived in the cities of Juda,   remained   and made Roboam king over them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01410  018" id="10  018" >18</span>
 And king Roboam sent to them Adoniram that was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. And king Roboam hasted to mount   his   chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01410  019" id="10  019" >19</span>
 So Israel rebelled against the house of David until this day.  
<!-- 11   019 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="11  001">11  </span> And Roboam came to Jerusalem; and he assembled Juda and Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand young men fit for war, and he waged war with Israel to recover the kingdom to Roboam.  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  002" id="11  002" >2</span>
 And the Word of the Lord came to Samaias the man of God, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  003" id="11  003" >3</span>
 Speak to Roboam the   son   of Solomon, and to all Juda and Benjamin, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  004" id="11  004" >4</span>
 Thus says the Lord, You° shall not go up, and you° shall not war against your brethren: return every one to his home; for this thing is of me. And they listened to the word of the Lord, and returned from going against Jeroboam.  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  005" id="11  005" >5</span>
 And Roboam lived in Jerusalem, and he built walled cities in Judea.  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  006" id="11  006" >6</span>
 And he built Bethleem, and Aetan and Thecoe,  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  007" id="11  007" >7</span>
 and Baethsura, and Sochoth, and Odollam,  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  008" id="11  008" >8</span>
 and Geth, and Marisa, and Ziph,  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  009" id="11  009" >9</span>
 and Adorai, and Lachis, and Azeca,  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  010" id="11  010" >10</span>
 and Saraa, and Aelom, and Chebron, which belong to Juda and Benjamin, walled cities.  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  011" id="11  011" >11</span>
 And he fortified them with walls, and placed in them captains, and stores of provisions, oil and wine,  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  012" id="11  012" >12</span>
 shields and spears in every several city, and he fortified them very strongly, and he had on his side Juda and Benjamin.  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  013" id="11  013" >13</span>
 And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel were gathered to him out of all the coasts.  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  014" id="11  014" >14</span>
 For the Levites left the tents of their possession, and went to Juda to Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had ejected them so that they should not minister to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  015" id="11  015" >15</span>
 And he made for himself priests of the high places, and for the idols, and for the vanities, and for the calves which Jeroboam made.  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  016" id="11  016" >16</span>
 And he cast out from the tribes of Israel those who set their heart to seek the Lord God of Israel: and they came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice to the Lord God of their fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  017" id="11  017" >17</span>
 And they strengthened the kingdom of Juda; and   Juda   strengthened Roboam the   son   of Solomon for three years, for he walked three years in the ways of David and Solomon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  018" id="11  018" >18</span>
 And Roboam took to himself for a wife, Moolath daughter of Jerimuth the son of David, and Abigaia daughter of Heliab the son of Jessae.  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  019" id="11  019" >19</span>
 And she bore him sons; Jeus, and Samoria, and Zaam.  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  020" id="11  020" >20</span>
 And afterwards he took to himself Maacha the daughter of Abessalom; and she bore him Abia, and Jetthi, and Zeza, and Salemoth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  021" id="11  021" >21</span>
 And Roboam loved Maacha the daughter of Abessalom more than all his wives and all his concubines: for he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines; and he begot twenty-eight sons, and sixty daughters.  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  022" id="11  022" >22</span>
 And he made Abia the son of Maacha chief,   even   a leader among his brethren, for he intended to make him king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01411  023" id="11  023" >23</span>
 And he was exalted beyond all his   other   sons in all the coasts of Juda and Benjamin, and in the strong cities; and he gave them provisions in great abundance: and he desired many wives.  
<!-- 12   023 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="12  001">12  </span> And it came to pass when the kingdom of Roboam was established, and when he had grown strong,   that   he forsook the commandments of the Lord, and all Israel with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01412  002" id="12  002" >2</span>
 And it came to pass in the fifth year of the reign of Roboam, Susakim king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had sinned against the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v01412  003" id="12  003" >3</span>
 with twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horses: and there was no number of the multitude that came with him from Egypt; Libyans, Trogodytes, and Ethiopians.  <span class="verse" rel="v01412  004" id="12  004" >4</span>
 And they obtained possession of the strong cities, which were in Juda, and came to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01412  005" id="12  005" >5</span>
 And Samaias the prophet came to Roboam, and to the princes of Juda that were gathered to Jerusalem for fear of Susakim, and said to them, Thus said the Lord, You° have left me, and I will leave you in the hand of Susakim.  <span class="verse" rel="v01412  006" id="12  006" >6</span>
 And the elders of Israel and the king were ashamed, and said, The Lord   is   righteous.  <span class="verse" rel="v01412  007" id="12  007" >7</span>
 And when the Lord saw that they repented, then came the word of the Lord to Samaias, saying, They have repented; I will not destroy them, but I will set them in safety for a little while, and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01412  008" id="12  008" >8</span>
 Nevertheless they shall be servants, and know my service, and the service of the kings of the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01412  009" id="12  009" >9</span>
 So Susakim king of Egypt went up against Jerusalem, and took the treasures that were in the house of the Lord, and the treasures that were in the king's house: he took all; and he took the golden shields which Solomon had made.  <span class="verse" rel="v01412  010" id="12  010" >10</span>
 And king Roboam made brazen shields instead of them. And Susakim set over him captains of footmen, as keepers of the gate of the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01412  011" id="12  011" >11</span>
 And it came to pass, when the king went into the house of the Lord, the guards and the footmen went in, and they that returned to meet the footmen.  <span class="verse" rel="v01412  012" id="12  012" >12</span>
 And when he repented, the anger of the Lord turned from him, and did not destroy him utterly; for there were good things in Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v01412  013" id="12  013" >13</span>
 So king Roboam strengthened   himself   in Jerusalem, and reigned: and Roboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, in the city which the Lord chose out of all the tribes of the children of Israel to call his name there: and his mother's name was Noomma the Ammanitess.  <span class="verse" rel="v01412  014" id="12  014" >14</span>
 And he did evil, for he directed not his heart to seek the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01412  015" id="12  015" >15</span>
 And the acts of Roboam, the first and the last, behold, are they not written in the book of Samaia the prophet, and Addo the seer, with his achievements.  <span class="verse" rel="v01412  016" id="12  016" >16</span>
 And Roboam made war with Jeroboam all   his   days. And Roboam died with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abia his son reigned in his stead.  
<!-- 13   016 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="13  001">13  </span> In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam Abia began to reign over Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  002" id="13  002" >2</span>
 He reigned three years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name   was   Maacha, daughter of Uriel of Gabaon. And there was war between Abia and Jeroboam.  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  003" id="13  003" >3</span>
 And Abia set the battle in array with an army, with mighty men of war,   even   four hundred thousand mighty men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand,   they were   mighty warriors of the host.  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  004" id="13  004" >4</span>
 And Abia rose up from the mount Somoron, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear you°, Jeroboam, and all Israel:  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  005" id="13  005" >5</span>
    Is it   not for you to know that the Lord God of Israel has given a king over Israel for ever to David, and to his sons, by a covenant of salt?  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  006" id="13  006" >6</span>
 But Jeroboam the   son   of Nabat, the servant of Solomon   the son   of David, is risen up, and has revolted from his master:  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  007" id="13  007" >7</span>
 and there are gathered to him pestilent men, transgressors, and he has risen up against Roboam the   son   of Solomon, while Roboam was young and fearful in heart, and he withstood him not.  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  008" id="13  008" >8</span>
 And now you° profess to resist the kingdom of the Lord in the hand of the sons of David; and you°   are   a great multitude, and with you are golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  009" id="13  009" >9</span>
 Did you° not cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and make to yourselves priests of the people of any   other   land? whoever came to consecrate himself with a calf of the heard and seven rams, he forthwith became a priest to that which is no god.  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  010" id="13  010" >10</span>
 But we have not forsaken the Lord our God, and his priests, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, minister to the Lord; and in their daily courses  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  011" id="13  011" >11</span>
 they sacrifice to the Lord whole burnt offering, morning and evening, and compound incense, and   set   the show bread on the pure table; and   there is   the golden candlestick, and the lamps for burning, to light in the evening: for we keep the charge of the Lord God of our fathers; but you° have forsaken him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  012" id="13  012" >12</span>
 And, behold, the Lord and his priests are with us at our head, and the signal trumpets to sound an alarm over us. Children of Israel, fight not against the Lord God of our fathers; for you° shall not prosper.  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  013" id="13  013" >13</span>
 Now Jeroboam had caused an ambush to come round upon him from behind: and he   himself   was before Juda, and the ambush behind.  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  014" id="13  014" >14</span>
 And Juda looked back, and, behold, the battle   was   against them before and behind: and they cried to the Lord, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  015" id="13  015" >15</span>
 And the men of Juda shouted: and it came to pass, when the men of Juda shouted, that the Lord struck Jeroboam and Israel before Abia and Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  016" id="13  016" >16</span>
 And the children of Israel fled from before Juda; and the Lord delivered them into their hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  017" id="13  017" >17</span>
 And Abia and his people struck them with a great slaughter: and there fell slain of Israel five hundred thousand mighty men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  018" id="13  018" >18</span>
 So the children of Israel were brought low in that day, and the children of Juda prevailed, because they trusted on the Lord God of their fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  019" id="13  019" >19</span>
 And Abia pursued after Jeroboam, and he took from him the cities, Baethel and her towns, and Jesyna and her towns, and Ephron and her towns.  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  020" id="13  020" >20</span>
 And Jeroboam did not recover strength again all the days of Abia: and the Lord struck him, and he died.  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  021" id="13  021" >21</span>
 But Abia strengthened himself, and took to himself fourteen wives, and he begot twenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters.  <span class="verse" rel="v01413  022" id="13  022" >22</span>
 And the rest of the acts of Abia, and his deeds, and his sayings, are written in the book of the prophet Addo.  
<!-- 14   022 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="14  001">14  </span> And Abia died with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In the days of Asa the land of Juda had rest ten years.  <span class="verse" rel="v01414  002" id="14  002" >2</span>
 And he did that which was good and right in the sight of the Lord his God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01414  003" id="14  003" >3</span>
 And he removed the altars of the strange   gods  , and the high places, and broke the pillars in pieces, and cut down the groves:  <span class="verse" rel="v01414  004" id="14  004" >4</span>
 and he told Juda to seek earnestly the Lord God of their fathers, and to perform the law and commandments.  <span class="verse" rel="v01414  005" id="14  005" >5</span>
 And he removed from all the cities of Juda the altars and the idols, and established in quietness  <span class="verse" rel="v01414  006" id="14  006" >6</span>
 fortified cities in the land of Juda; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in these years; for the Lord gave him rest.  <span class="verse" rel="v01414  007" id="14  007" >7</span>
 And he said to Juda, Let us fortify these cities, and make walls, and towers, and gates, and bars: we shall prevail over the land, for as we have sought out the Lord our God, he has sought out us, and has given us rest round about, and prospered us.  <span class="verse" rel="v01414  008" id="14  008" >8</span>
 And Asa had a force of armed men bearing shields and spears in the land of Juda,   even   three hundred thousand, and in the land of Benjamin two hundred and eighty thousand targeteers and archers: all these were mighty warriors.  <span class="verse" rel="v01414  009" id="14  009" >9</span>
 And Zare the Ethiopian went out against them, with a force of a million, and three hundred chariots; and came to Maresa.  <span class="verse" rel="v01414  010" id="14  010" >10</span>
 And Asa went out to meet him, and set the battle in array in the valley north of Maresa.  <span class="verse" rel="v01414  011" id="14  011" >11</span>
 And Asa cried to the Lord his God, and said, O Lord, it is not impossible with you to save by many or by few: strengthen us, O Lord our God; for we trust in you, and in your name have we come against this great multitude. O Lord our God, let not man prevail against you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01414  012" id="14  012" >12</span>
 And the Lord struck the Ethiopians before Juda; and the Ethiopians fled.  <span class="verse" rel="v01414  013" id="14  013" >13</span>
 And Asa and his people pursued them to Gedor; and the Ethiopians fell, so that they could not recover themselves; for they were crushed before the Lord, and before his host; and they took many spoils.  <span class="verse" rel="v01414  014" id="14  014" >14</span>
 And they destroyed their towns roundabout Gedor; for a terror of the Lord was upon them: and they spoiled all their cities, for they had much spoil.  <span class="verse" rel="v01414  015" id="14  015" >15</span>
 Also they destroyed the tents of cattle, and the Alimazons, and took many sheep and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.

<p><span class="chapter" id="15  001">15  </span> And Azarias the son of Oded—upon him came the Spirit of the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v01415  002" id="15  002" >2</span>
 and he went out to meet Asa, and all Juda and Benjamin, and said, Hear me, Asa, and all Juda and Benjamin. The Lord   is   with you, while you° are with him; and if you° seek him out, he will be found of you; but if you° forsake him, he will forsake you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01415  003" id="15  003" >3</span>
 And Israel   has been   a long time without the true God, and without a priest to expound   the truth  , and without the law.  <span class="verse" rel="v01415  004" id="15  004" >4</span>
 But he shall turn them to the Lord God of Israel, and he will be found of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01415  005" id="15  005" >5</span>
 And in that time there is no peace to one going out, or to one coming in, for the terror of the Lord is upon all that inhabit the lands.  <span class="verse" rel="v01415  006" id="15  006" >6</span>
 And nation shall fight against nation, and city against city; for God has confounded them with every   kind of   affliction.  <span class="verse" rel="v01415  007" id="15  007" >7</span>
 But be you° strong, and let not your hands be weakened: for there is a reward for your work.  <span class="verse" rel="v01415  008" id="15  008" >8</span>
 And when   Asa   heard these words, and the prophesy of Adad the prophet, then he strengthened himself, and cast out the abominations from all the land of Juda and Benjamin, and from the cities which Jeroboam possessed, in mount Ephraim, and he renewed the altar of the Lord, which was before the temple of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01415  009" id="15  009" >9</span>
 And he assembled Juda and Benjamin, and the strangers that lived with him, of Ephraim, and of Manasse, and of Symeon: for many of Israel were joined to him, when they saw that the Lord his God was with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01415  010" id="15  010" >10</span>
 And they assembled at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.  <span class="verse" rel="v01415  011" id="15  011" >11</span>
 And he sacrificed to the Lord in that day of the spoils which they brought, seven hundred calves and seven thousand sheep.  <span class="verse" rel="v01415  012" id="15  012" >12</span>
 And he entered into a covenant that they should seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul.  <span class="verse" rel="v01415  013" id="15  013" >13</span>
 And that whoever should not seek the Lord God of Israel, should die, whether young or old, whether man or woman.  <span class="verse" rel="v01415  014" id="15  014" >14</span>
 And they swore to the Lord with a loud voice, and with trumpets, and with cornets.  <span class="verse" rel="v01415  015" id="15  015" >15</span>
 And all Juda rejoiced concerning the oath: for they swore with all their heart, and they sought him with all their desires; and he was found of them: and the Lord gave them rest round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v01415  016" id="15  016" >16</span>
 And he removed Maacha his mother from being priestess to Astarte; and he cut down the idol, and burnt it in the brook of Kedron.  <span class="verse" rel="v01415  017" id="15  017" >17</span>
 Nevertheless they removed not the high places: they still existed in Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.  <span class="verse" rel="v01415  018" id="15  018" >18</span>
 And he brought in the holy things of David his father, and the holy things of the house of God, silver, and gold, and vessels.  <span class="verse" rel="v01415  019" id="15  019" >19</span>
 And there was no war   waged   with him until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.

<p><span class="chapter" id="16  001">16  </span> And in the thirty-eighth year of the reign of Asa, the king of Israel went up against Juda, and built Rama, so as not to allow egress or ingress to Asa king of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v01416  002" id="16  002" >2</span>
 And Asa took silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the Lord, and of the king's house, and sent   them   to the son of Ader king of Syria, which lived in Damascus, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01416  003" id="16  003" >3</span>
 Make a covenant between me and you, and between my father and your father: behold, I have sent you gold and silver: come, and turn away from me Baasa king of Israel, and let him depart from me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01416  004" id="16  004" >4</span>
 And the son of Ader listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his host against the cities of Israel; and struck Aeon, and Dan, and Abelmain, and all the country round Nephthali.  <span class="verse" rel="v01416  005" id="16  005" >5</span>
 And it came to pass when Baasa heard   it   he left off building Rama, and put a stop to his work:  <span class="verse" rel="v01416  006" id="16  006" >6</span>
 then king Asa took all Juda, and took the stones of Rama, and its timber,   with   which Baasa   had   built; and he built with them Gabae and Maspha.  <span class="verse" rel="v01416  007" id="16  007" >7</span>
 And at that time came Anani the prophet to Asa king of Juda, and said to him, Because you did trust on the king of Syria, and did not trust on the Lord your God, therefore the army of Syria is escaped out of your hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v01416  008" id="16  008" >8</span>
 Were not the Ethiopians and Libyans a great force, in courage, in horsemen, in great numbers? and did not He deliver them into your hands, because you trusted in the Lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v01416  009" id="16  009" >9</span>
 For the eyes of the Lord look upon all the earth, to strengthen every heart that is perfect toward him. In this you have done foolishly; henceforth there shall be war with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01416  010" id="16  010" >10</span>
 And Asa was angry with the prophet, and put him in prison, for he was angry at this: and Asa vexed some of the people at that time.  <span class="verse" rel="v01416  011" id="16  011" >11</span>
 And, behold, the acts of Asa, the first and the last,   are   written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01416  012" id="16  012" >12</span>
 And Asa was diseased   in   his feet in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, until he was very ill: but in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians.  <span class="verse" rel="v01416  013" id="16  013" >13</span>
 And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the forties year of his reign.  <span class="verse" rel="v01416  014" id="16  014" >14</span>
 And they buried him in the sepulchre which he had dug for himself in the city of David, and they laid him on a bed, and filled   it   with spices and   all   kinds of perfumes of the apothecaries; and they made for him a very great funeral.

<p><span class="chapter" id="17  001">17  </span> And Josaphat his son reigned in his stead, Josaphat strengthened himself against Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01417  002" id="17  002" >2</span>
 And he put garrisons in all the strong cities of Juda, and appointed captains in all the cities of Juda, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.  <span class="verse" rel="v01417  003" id="17  003" >3</span>
 And the Lord was with Josaphat, for he walked in the first ways of his father, and did not seek to idols;  <span class="verse" rel="v01417  004" id="17  004" >4</span>
 but he sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in the commandments of his father, and not according to the works of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01417  005" id="17  005" >5</span>
 And the Lord prospered the kingdom in his hand; and all Juda gave gifts to Josaphat; and he had great wealth and glory.  <span class="verse" rel="v01417  006" id="17  006" >6</span>
 And his heart was exalted in the way of the Lord; and he removed the high places and the groves from the land of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v01417  007" id="17  007" >7</span>
 And in the third year of his reign, he sent his chief men, and his mighty men, Abdias and Zacharias, and Nathanael, and Michaias, to teach in the cities of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v01417  008" id="17  008" >8</span>
 And with them   were   the Levites, Samaias, and Nathanias, and Zabdias, and Asiel, and Semiramoth, and Jonathan, and Adonias, and Tobias, and Tobadonias, Levites, and with them Elisama and Joram, the priests.  <span class="verse" rel="v01417  009" id="17  009" >9</span>
 And they taught in Juda, and   there was   with them the book of the law of the Lord, and they passed through the cities of Juda, and taught the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01417  010" id="17  010" >10</span>
 And a terror of the Lord was upon all the kingdoms of the land round about Juda, and they made no war against Josaphat.  <span class="verse" rel="v01417  011" id="17  011" >11</span>
 And   some   of the Philistines brought to Josaphat gifts, and silver, and presents; and the Arabians brought him seven thousand seven hundred rams.  <span class="verse" rel="v01417  012" id="17  012" >12</span>
 And Josaphat increased in greatness exceedingly, and built in Judea places of abode, and strong cities.  <span class="verse" rel="v01417  013" id="17  013" >13</span>
 And he had many works in Judea: and the mighty men of war,   the men   of strength,   were   in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01417  014" id="17  014" >14</span>
 And this   is   their number according to the houses of their fathers; even the captains of thousands in Juda   were  , Ednas the chief, and with him mighty men of strength three hundred thousand.  <span class="verse" rel="v01417  015" id="17  015" >15</span>
 And after him, Joanan the captain, and with him two hundred eighty thousand.  <span class="verse" rel="v01417  016" id="17  016" >16</span>
 And after him Amasias the   son   of Zari, who was zealous for the Lord; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v01417  017" id="17  017" >17</span>

 And he went down after a term of years to Achaab to Samaria: and Achaab killed for him sheep and calves, in abundance, and for the people with him, and he much desired him to go up with him to Ramoth of the country of Galaad.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  003" id="18  003" >3</span>
 And Achaab king of Israel said to Josaphat king of Juda, Will you go with me to Ramoth of the country of Galaad? And he said to him, As I   am  , so also   are   you, as your people,   so   also   is   my people with you for the war.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  004" id="18  004" >4</span>
 And Josaphat said to the king of Israel, Seek, I pray you, the Lord today.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  005" id="18  005" >5</span>
 And the king of Israel gathered the prophets, four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go to Ramoth Galaad to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, and God shall deliver   it   into the hands of the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  006" id="18  006" >6</span>
 And Josaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides, that we may enquire of him?  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  007" id="18  007" >7</span>
 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, There is yet one man by whom to enquire of the Lord; but I hate him, for he does not prophesy concerning me for good, for all his days   are   for evil: this   is   Michaias the son of Jembla. And Josaphat said, Let not the king say so.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  008" id="18  008" >8</span>
 And the king called an eunuch, and said,   Fetch   quickly Michaias the son of Jembla.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  009" id="18  009" >9</span>
 And the king of Israel and Josaphat king of Juda were sitting each on his throne, and clothed in their robes, sitting in the open space at the entrance of the gate of Samaria: and all the prophets were prophesying before them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  010" id="18  010" >10</span>
 And Sedekias son of Chanaan made for himself iron horns, and said, Thus says the Lord, With these you shall thrust Syria until it be consumed.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  011" id="18  011" >11</span>
 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Galaad, and you shall prosper; and the Lord shall deliver it into the hands of the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  012" id="18  012" >12</span>
 And the messenger that went to call Michaias spoke to him, saying, Behold, the prophets have spoken favourably concerning the king with one mouth; let now, I pray you, your words be as   the words   of one of them, and do you speak good things.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  013" id="18  013" >13</span>
 And Michaias said,   As   the Lord lives, whatever God shall say to me, that will I speak.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  014" id="18  014" >14</span>
 And he came to the king, and the king said to him, Michaias, shall I go up to Ramoth Galaad to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go up, and you shall prosper, and they shall be given into your hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  015" id="18  015" >15</span>
 And the king said to him, How often shall I solemnly charge you that you speak to me nothing but truth in the name of the Lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  016" id="18  016" >16</span>
 And he said, I saw Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep without a shepherd: and the Lord said, These have no commander; let each return to his home in peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  017" id="18  017" >17</span>
 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, Said I not to you, that he would not prophesy concerning me good, but evil?  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  018" id="18  018" >18</span>
 But he said, Not so. Hear you° the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven stood by on his right hand and on his left.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  019" id="18  019" >19</span>
 And the Lord said, Who will deceive Achaab king of Israel, that he may go up, and fall in Ramoth Galaad? And one spoke this way, and another spoke that way.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  020" id="18  020" >20</span>
 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said, I will deceive him. And the Lord said, Whereby?  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  021" id="18  021" >21</span>
 And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And   the Lord   said, You shall deceive   him  , and shall prevail: go forth, and do so.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  022" id="18  022" >22</span>
 And now, behold, the Lord has put a false spirit in the mouth of these your prophets, and the Lord has spoken evil against you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  023" id="18  023" >23</span>
 Then Sedekias the son of Chanaan drew near, and struck Michaias on the cheek, and said to him, By what way passed the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak to you?  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  024" id="18  024" >24</span>
 And Michaias said, Behold, you shall see in that day, when you shall go from chamber to chamber to hide yourself.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  025" id="18  025" >25</span>
 And the king of Israel said, Take Michaias, and carry him back to Emer the governor of the city, and to Joas the captain, the king's son;  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  026" id="18  026" >26</span>
 and you° shall say, Thus said the king, Put this fellow into the prison house, and let him eat the bread of affliction, and   drink   the water of affliction, until I return in peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  027" id="18  027" >27</span>
 And Michaias said, If you do at all return in peace, the Lord has not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, all you° people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  028" id="18  028" >28</span>
 So the king of Israel, and Josaphat king of Juda, went up to Ramoth Galaad.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  029" id="18  029" >29</span>
 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, Disguise me, and I will enter into the battle: and do you put on my raiment. so the king of Israel disguised himself, and entered into the battle.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  030" id="18  030" >30</span>
 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight neither against small nor great, but only against the king of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  031" id="18  031" >31</span>
 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Josaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel: and they compassed him about to fight against him: and Josaphat cried out, and the Lord delivered him; and God turned them away from him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  032" id="18  032" >32</span>
 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned away from him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  033" id="18  033" >33</span>
 And a man drew a bow with a good aim, and struck the king of Israel between the lungs and the breast-plate: and he said to the charioteer, Turn your hand, drive me out of the battle, for I am wounded.  <span class="verse" rel="v01418  034" id="18  034" >34</span>
 And the battle turned in that day; and the king of Israel remained on the chariot against Syria until evening, and died at sunset.

 Nevertheless   some   good things have been found in you, forasmuch as you did remove the groves from the land of Juda, and did direct your heart to seek after the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01419  004" id="19  004" >4</span>

 Moreover Josaphat appointed in Jerusalem some of the priests, and Levites, and heads of houses of Israel, for the judgment of the Lord, and to judge the dwellers in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01419  009" id="19  009" >9</span>

 Whatsoever man of your brethren that dwell in their cities   shall bring   the cause that comes before you, between blood   and   blood, and between precept and commandment, and ordinances and judgments, you° shall even decide for them; so they shall not sin against the Lord, and there shall not be wrath upon you, and upon your brethren: thus you° shall do, and you° shall not sin.  <span class="verse" rel="v01419  011" id="19  011" >11</span>
 And, behold, Amarias the priest is head over you in every matter of the Lord; and Zabdias the son of Ismael is head over the house of Juda in every matter of the king; and the scribes and Levites are before you: be strong and active, and the Lord shall be with the good.

<p><span class="chapter" id="20  001">20  </span> And after this came the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them   some   of the Minaeans, against Josaphat to battle.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  002" id="20  002" >2</span>
 And they came and told Josaphat, saying, There is come against you a great multitude from Syria, from beyond the sea; and, behold, they are in Asasan Thamar, this is Engadi.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  003" id="20  003" >3</span>
 And Josaphat was alarmed, and set his face to seek the Lord earnestly, and he proclaimed a fast in all Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  004" id="20  004" >4</span>
 And Juda gathered themselves together to seek after the Lord: even from all the cities of Juda they came to seek the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  005" id="20  005" >5</span>
 And Josaphat stood up in the assembly of Juda in Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord, in front of the new court.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  006" id="20  006" >6</span>
 And he said, O Lord God of my fathers, are not you God in heaven above, and are not you Lord of all the kingdoms of the nations? and   is there   not in your hand the might of dominion, and there is no one who can resist you?  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  007" id="20  007" >7</span>
 Are not you the Lord that did destroy the inhabitants of this land before the face of your people Israel, and did give it to your beloved seed of Abraham for ever?  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  008" id="20  008" >8</span>
 And they lived in it, and built in it a sanctuary to your name, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  009" id="20  009" >9</span>
 If there should come upon us evils, sword, judgment, pestilence, famine, we will stand before this house, and before you, (for your name   is   upon this house,) and we will cry to you because of the affliction, and you shall hear, and deliver.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  010" id="20  010" >10</span>
 And now, behold, the children of Ammon, and Moab, and mount Seir, with regard to whom you did not permit Israel to pass through their border, when they had come out of the land of Egypt, (for they turned away from them, and did not destroy them;)—  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  011" id="20  011" >11</span>
 yet now, behold, they make attempts against us, to come forth to cast us out from our inheritance which you gave us.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  012" id="20  012" >12</span>
 O Lord our God, will you not judge them? for we have no strength to resist this great multitude that is come against us; and we know not what we shall do to them: but our eyes are toward you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  013" id="20  013" >13</span>
 And all Juda was standing before the Lord, and their children, and their wives.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  014" id="20  014" >14</span>
 And Oziel the   son   of Zacharias, of the children of Banaias, of the sons of Eleiel, the sons of Matthanias the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, —upon him came the Spirit of the Lord in the assembly:  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  015" id="20  015" >15</span>
 and he said, Hear you°, all Juda, and the dwellers in Jerusalem, and king Josaphat: Thus says the Lord to you, even you, Fear not, neither be alarmed, before all this great multitude; for the battle is not years, but God's.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  016" id="20  016" >16</span>
 To-morrow go you° down against them: behold, they come up by the ascent of Assis, and you° shall find them at the extremity of the river of the wilderness of Jeriel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  017" id="20  017" >17</span>
 It is not for you to fight: understand these things, and see the deliverance of the Lord with you, Juda and Jerusalem: fear not, neither be afraid to go forth to-morrow to meet them; and the Lord shall be with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  018" id="20  018" >18</span>
 And Josaphat bowed with his face   to the ground   with all Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem,   and   they fell before the Lord to worship the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  019" id="20  019" >19</span>
 And the Levites of the children of Caath, and   they   of the sons of Core, rose up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  020" id="20  020" >20</span>
 And they rose early in the morning and went out to the wilderness of Thecoe: and as they went out, Josaphat stood and cried, and said, Hear me, Juda, and the dwellers in Jerusalem; put your trust in the Lord God, and your trust shall be honored; trust in his prophet, and you° shall prosper.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  021" id="20  021" >21</span>
 And he took counsel with the people, and set appointed men to sing psalms and praises, to give thanks, and sing the holy songs of praise in going forth before the host: and they said, Give thanks to the Lord, for his mercy   endures   for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  022" id="20  022" >22</span>
 And when they began the praise and thanksgiving, the Lord caused the children of Ammon to fight against Moab, and   the inhabitants of   mount Seir that came out against Juda; and they were routed.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  023" id="20  023" >23</span>
 Then the children of Ammon and Moab rose up against the dwellers in mount Seir, to destroy and consume them; and when they had made an end of   destroying   the inhabitants of Seir, they rose up against one another so that they were utterly destroyed.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  024" id="20  024" >24</span>
 And Juda came to the watch-tower of the wilderness, and looked, and saw the multitude, and, behold,   they were   all fallen dead upon the earth, not one escaped.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  025" id="20  025" >25</span>
 And Josaphat and his people went out to spoil them, and they found much cattle, and furniture, and spoils, and precious things: and they spoiled them, and they were three days gathering the spoil, for it was abundant.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  026" id="20  026" >26</span>
 And it came to pass on the fourth day they were gathered to the Valley of Blessing; for there they blessed the Lord: therefore they called the name of the place the Valley of Blessing, until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  027" id="20  027" >27</span>
 And all the men of Juda returned to Jerusalem, and Josaphat led them with great joy; for the Lord gave them joy over their enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  028" id="20  028" >28</span>
 And they entered into Jerusalem with lutes and harps and trumpets,   going   into the house of the lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  029" id="20  029" >29</span>
 And there was a terror of the Lord upon all the kingdoms of the land, when they heard that the Lord fought against the enemies of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  030" id="20  030" >30</span>
 And the kingdom of Josaphat was at peace; and his God gave him rest round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  031" id="20  031" >31</span>
 And Josaphat reigned over Juda, being thirty-five years   old   when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Azuba, daughter of Sali.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  032" id="20  032" >32</span>
 And he walked in the ways of his father Asa, and turned not aside from doing that which was right in the sight of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  033" id="20  033" >33</span>
 nevertheless the high places yet remained; and as yet the people did not direct their heart to the Lord God of their fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  034" id="20  034" >34</span>
 And the rest of the acts of Josaphat, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the history of Jeu   the son   of Anani, who wrote the book of the kings of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  035" id="20  035" >35</span>
 And afterwards Josaphat king of Juda entered into an alliance with Ochozias king of Israel, (now this was an unrighteous man,)  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  036" id="20  036" >36</span>
 by acting   with   and going to him, to build ships to go to Tharsis: and he built ships in Gasion Gaber.  <span class="verse" rel="v01420  037" id="20  037" >37</span>
 And Eliezer you   son   of Dodia of Marisa prophesied against Josaphat, saying, Forasmuch as you have allied yourself with Ochozias, the Lord has broken your work, and your vessels have been wrecked. And they could not go to Tharsis.

<p><span class="chapter" id="21  001">21  </span> And Josaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Joran his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01421  002" id="21  002" >2</span>
 And he had brothers, the six sons of Josaphat, Azarias, and Jeiel, and Zacharias, and Azarias, and Michael, and Zaphatias: all these   were   the sons of Josaphat king of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v01421  003" id="21  003" >3</span>
 And their father gave them many gifts, silver, and gold, and arms, together with fortified cities in Juda: but he gave the kingdom to Joram, for he   was   the firstborn.  <span class="verse" rel="v01421  004" id="21  004" >4</span>
 And Joram entered upon his kingdom, and strengthened himself, and killed all his brothers with the sword, and   some   of the princes of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01421  005" id="21  005" >5</span>
 When he was thirty and two years old, Joram succeeded to his kingdom, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01421  006" id="21  006" >6</span>
 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Achaab; for a daughter of Achaab was his wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord:  <span class="verse" rel="v01421  007" id="21  007" >7</span>
 nevertheless the Lord would not utterly destroy the house of David, because of the covenant which he made with David, and as he said to him that he would give a light to him and his sons for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v01421  008" id="21  008" >8</span>
 In those days Edom revolted from Juda, and they made a king over themselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v01421  009" id="21  009" >9</span>
 And Joram went with the princes, and all the cavalry with him: and it came to pass that he arose by night, and struck Edom that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots, and the people fled to their tents.  <span class="verse" rel="v01421  010" id="21  010" >10</span>
 And Edom revolted from Juda until this day. Then Lomna at that time revolted from   under   his hand, because he forsook the Lord God of his fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v01421  011" id="21  011" >11</span>
 For he built high places in the cities of Juda, and caused the dwellers in Jerusalem to go a-whoring, and led Juda astray.  <span class="verse" rel="v01421  012" id="21  012" >12</span>
 And there came to him   a message   in writing from Eliu the prophet, saying, Thus says the Lord God of your father David, Because you have not walked in the way of your father Josaphat, nor in the ways of Asa king of Juda,  <span class="verse" rel="v01421  013" id="21  013" >13</span>
 but have walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and have caused Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem to go a-whoring, as the house of Achaab caused   Israel   to go a-whoring, and you have slain your brethren, the sons of your father, who were better than yourself;  <span class="verse" rel="v01421  014" id="21  014" >14</span>
 behold, the Lord shall strike you with a great plague among your people, and your sons, and your wives, and all your store:  <span class="verse" rel="v01421  015" id="21  015" >15</span>
 and you   shall be afflicted   with a grievous disease, with a disease of the bowels, until your bowels shall fall out day by day with the sickness.  <span class="verse" rel="v01421  016" id="21  016" >16</span>
 So the Lord stirred up the Philistines against Joram, and the Arabians, and those who bordered on the Aethiopians:  <span class="verse" rel="v01421  017" id="21  017" >17</span>
 and they went up against Juda, and prevailed against them, and took away all the store which they found in the house of the king, and his sons, and his daughters; and there was no son left to him but Ochozias the youngest of his sons.  <span class="verse" rel="v01421  018" id="21  018" >18</span>
 And after all these things the Lord struck him in the bowels with an incurable disease.  <span class="verse" rel="v01421  019" id="21  019" >19</span>
 And it continued from day to day: and when the time of the days came   to   two years, his bowels fell out with the disease, and he died by a grievous distemper: and his people performed no funeral, like the funeral of his fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v01421  020" id="21  020" >20</span>
 He was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. And he departed without honor, and was buried in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.

<p><span class="chapter" id="22  001">22  </span> And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ochozias his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of robbers that came against them, even the Arabians and the Alimazonians, had slain all the elder ones. So Ochozias son of Joram king of Juda reigned.  <span class="verse" rel="v01422  002" id="22  002" >2</span>
 Ochozias began to reign when he was twenty years old, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Gotholia, the daughter of Ambri.  <span class="verse" rel="v01422  003" id="22  003" >3</span>
 And he walked in the way of the house of Achaab; for his mother was his counsellor to do evil.  <span class="verse" rel="v01422  004" id="22  004" >4</span>
 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord as the house of Achaab   had done  : for they were his counselors after the death of his father to his destruction.  <span class="verse" rel="v01422  005" id="22  005" >5</span>
 And he walked in their counsels, and he went with Joram son of Achaab king of Israel to war against Azael king of Syria to Ramoth Galaad: and the archers struck Joram.  <span class="verse" rel="v01422  006" id="22  006" >6</span>
 And Joram returned to Jezrael to be healed of the wounds wherewith the Syrians struck him in Ramoth, when he fought against Azael king of Syria. And Ochozias son of Joram, king of Juda, went down to see Joram the son of Achaab at Jezrael because he was sick.  <span class="verse" rel="v01422  007" id="22  007" >7</span>
 And destruction from God came upon Ochozias in   his   coming to Joram; for when he had come, Joram went out with him against Jeu the son of Namessei, the anointed of the Lord against the house of Achaab.  <span class="verse" rel="v01422  008" id="22  008" >8</span>
 And it came to pass, when Jeu was taking vengeance on the house of Achaab, that he found the princes of Juda and the brethren of Ochozias ministering to Ochozias, and he killed them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01422  009" id="22  009" >9</span>
 And he gave orders to seek Ochozias: and they took him while he was healing his wounds in Samaria, and they brought him to Jeu, and he killed him; and they buried him, for they said, He is the son of Josaphat, who sought the Lord with all his heart. So there was none in the house of Ochozias to secure their power in the kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v01422  010" id="22  010" >10</span>
 And Gotholia the mother of Ochozias saw that her son was dead, and she arose and destroyed all the seed royal in the house of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v01422  011" id="22  011" >11</span>
 But Josabeeth, the daughter of the king, took Joas the son of Ochozias and rescued him secretly out of the midst of the sons of the king that were put to death, and she placed him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Josabeeth daughter of king Joram, sister of Ochozias, wife of Jodae the priest, hid him, and she   even   hid him from Gotholia, and she did not kill him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01422  012" id="22  012" >12</span>
 And he was with him hid in the house of God six years; and Gotholia reigned over the land.

<p><span class="chapter" id="23  001">23  </span> And in the eighth year Jodae strengthened   himself  , and took the captains of hundreds, Azarias the son of Joram, and Ismael the son of Joanan, and Azarias the son of Obed, and Maasaeas the son of Adia, and Elisaphan the son of Zacharias, with him to the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01423  002" id="23  002" >2</span>
 And they went round about Juda, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Juda, and heads of the families of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01423  003" id="23  003" >3</span>
 and all the congregation of Juda made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he showed them the king's son, and said to them, Behold, let the king's son reign, as the Lord said concerning the house of David.  <span class="verse" rel="v01423  004" id="23  004" >4</span>
 Now this   is   the thing which you° shall do. Let a third part of you,   even   of the priests and of the Levites, enter in on the sabbath, even into the gates of the entrances;  <span class="verse" rel="v01423  005" id="23  005" >5</span>

 And let not   any one   enter into the house of the Lord, except the priests and the Levites, and the servants of the Levites; they shall enter in, because they are holy: and let all the people keep the watch of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01423  007" id="23  007" >7</span>
 And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man's weapon in his hand; and whoever   else   goes into the house shall die: but they shall be with the king when he goes out, and when he comes in.  <span class="verse" rel="v01423  008" id="23  008" >8</span>
 And the Levites and all Juda did according to all that the priest Jodae commanded them, and they took each his men from the beginning of the sabbath to the end of the sabbath, for Jodae the priest did not dismiss the courses.  <span class="verse" rel="v01423  009" id="23  009" >9</span>
 And Jodae gave to the men the swords, and the shields, and the arms, which   had   belonged to King David, in the house of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01423  010" id="23  010" >10</span>
 And he set the whole people, every man with his arms, from the right side of the house to the left side of the altar and the house, over against the king round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v01423  011" id="23  011" >11</span>
 And he brought out the king's son, and put on him the crown and the testimony, and Jodae the priest and his sons proclaimed him king, and anointed him, and said, Long live the king!  <span class="verse" rel="v01423  012" id="23  012" >12</span>
 And Gotholia heard the sound of the people running, and acknowledging and praising the king: and she went in to the king into the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01423  013" id="23  013" >13</span>
 And she looked, and, behold, the king   stood   in his place, and the princes and trumpets were at the entrance, and the princes were round the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded the trumpets, and there were the singers singing with instruments, and singing hymns of praise. and Gotholia tore her robe, and cried, you° surely are plotting against   me  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01423  014" id="23  014" >14</span>
 And Jodae the priest went forth, and Jodae the priest charged the captains of hundreds, even the captains of the host, and said to them, Thrust her forth outside the house, and follow her, and let her be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Let her not be slain in the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01423  015" id="23  015" >15</span>
 So they let her go   out  ; and she went through the horsemen's gate of the house of the king, and they killed her there.  <span class="verse" rel="v01423  016" id="23  016" >16</span>
 And Jodae made a covenant between himself, and the people, and the king, that the people should be the Lord's.  <span class="verse" rel="v01423  017" id="23  017" >17</span>
 And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and tore down it and its altars, and they ground his images to powder, and they killed Matthan the priest of Baal before his altars.  <span class="verse" rel="v01423  018" id="23  018" >18</span>
 And Jodae the priest committed the works of the house of the Lord into the and of the priests and Levites, and he re-established the courses of the priests and Levites which David appointed over the house of the Lord, and   he appointed them   to offer whole burnt offerings to the Lord, as it is written in the law of Moses, with gladness, and with songs by the hand of David.  <span class="verse" rel="v01423  019" id="23  019" >19</span>
 And the porters stood at the gates of the house of the Lord, that no one unclean in any respect should enter in.  <span class="verse" rel="v01423  020" id="23  020" >20</span>
 And he took the heads of families, and the mighty men, and the chiefs of the people, and all the people of the land, and they conducted the king into the house of the Lord; and he went through the inner gate into the king's house, and they seated the king on the throne of the kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v01423  021" id="23  021" >21</span>

 And king Joas called Jodae the chief, and said to him, Why have you not looked after the Levites, so that they should bring from Juda and Jerusalem that which was prescribed by Moses the man of God, when he assembled Israel at the tabernacle of witness?  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  007" id="24  007" >7</span>
 For Gotholia was a transgressor, and her sons tore down the house of God; for they offered the holy things of the house of the Lord to Baalim.  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  008" id="24  008" >8</span>
 And the king said, Let a box be made, and let it be put at the gate of the house of the Lord without.  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  009" id="24  009" >9</span>
 And let   men   proclaim in Juda an in Jerusalem, that   the people   should bring to the Lord, as Moses the servant of God spoke concerning Israel in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  010" id="24  010" >10</span>
 And all the princes and all the people gave, and brought in, and cast into the box until it was filled.  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  011" id="24  011" >11</span>
 And it came to pass, when they brought in the box to the officers of the king by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that the money was more than sufficient, then came the king's scribe, and the officer of the high priest, and emptied the box, and restored it to its place. Thus they did day by day, and collected much money.  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  012" id="24  012" >12</span>
 And the king and Jodae the priest gave it to the workmen employed in the service of the house of the Lord, and they hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the Lord, also smiths and braziers to repair the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  013" id="24  013" >13</span>
 And the workmen wrought, and the works prospered in their hands, and they established the house of the Lord on its foundation, and strengthened   it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  014" id="24  014" >14</span>
 And when they had finished   it  , they brought to the king and to Jodae the remainder of the money, and they made vessels for the house of the Lord, vessels of service for whole burnt offerings, and gold and silver   censers  : and they offered up whole burnt offerings in the house of the Lord continually all the days of Jodae.  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  015" id="24  015" >15</span>
 And Jodae grew old, being full of days, and he died, being a hundred and thirty years old at his death.  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  016" id="24  016" >16</span>
 And they buried him with the kings in the city of David, because he had dealt well with Israel, and with God and his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  017" id="24  017" >17</span>
 And it came to pass after the death of Jodae,   that   the princes of Juda went in, and did obeisance to the king. Then the king listened to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  018" id="24  018" >18</span>
 And they forsook the house of the Lord God of their fathers, and served the Astartes and idols: and there was wrath upon Juda and Jerusalem in that day.  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  019" id="24  019" >19</span>
 yet he sent prophets to them, to turn them to the Lord; but they listened not: and he testified to them, but they obeyed not.  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  020" id="24  020" >20</span>
 And the Spirit of God came upon Azarias the son of Jodae the priest, and he stood up above the people, and said, Thus says the Lord, Why do you° transgress the commandments of the Lord? so shall you° not prosper; for you° have forsaken the Lord, and he will forsake you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  021" id="24  021" >21</span>
 And they conspired against him, and stone him by command of king Joas in the court of the Lord's house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  022" id="24  022" >22</span>
 So Joas remembered not the kindness which his father Jodae had exercised towards him, but killed his son. And as he died, he said, The Lord look upon   it  , and judge.  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  023" id="24  023" >23</span>
 And it came to pass after the end of the year,   that   the host of Syria went up against him, and came against Juda and Jerusalem: and they killed all the chiefs of the people among the people, and all their spoils they sent to the king of Damascus.  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  024" id="24  024" >24</span>
 For the army of Syria came with few men, yet God gave into their hands a very large army, because they had forsaken the God of their fathers; and he brought judgments on Joas.  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  025" id="24  025" >25</span>
 And after they had departed from him, when they had left him in sore diseases, then his servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son of Jodae the priest, and killed him on his bed, and he died, and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchre of the kings.  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  026" id="24  026" >26</span>
 And they that conspired against him were Zabed the son of Samaath the Ammanite, and Jozabed the son of Samareth the Moabite.  <span class="verse" rel="v01424  027" id="24  027" >27</span>
 And all his sons, and the five came to him: and the other   matters  , behold, they are written in the book of the kings. And Amasias his son reigned in his stead.

<p><span class="chapter" id="25  001">25  </span> Amasias began to reign when he was twenty and five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name   was   Joadaen of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  002" id="25  002" >2</span>
 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  003" id="25  003" >3</span>
 And it came to pass, when the kingdom was established in his hand, that he killed his servants who had slain the king his father.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  004" id="25  004" >4</span>
 But he killed not their sons, according to the covenant of the law of the Lord, as it is written,   and   as the Lord commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, and the sons shall not die for the fathers, but they shall die each for his own sin.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  005" id="25  005" >5</span>
 And Amasias assembled the house of Juda, and appointed them according to the houses of their families for captains of thousands and captains of hundreds in all Juda and Jerusalem: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upwards, and found them three hundred thousand able to go out to war, holding spear and shield.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  006" id="25  006" >6</span>
 Also he hired of Israel a hundred thousand mighty   men for   a hundred talents of silver.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  007" id="25  007" >7</span>
 And there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the host of Israel go with you; for the Lord is not with Israel,   even   all the sons of Ephraim.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  008" id="25  008" >8</span>
 For if you shall undertake to strengthen   yourself   with these, then the lord shall put you to flight before the enemies: for it is of the Lord both to strengthen and to put to flight.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  009" id="25  009" >9</span>
 And Amasias said to the man of God, But what shall I do   for   the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God said, The Lord can give you much more than these.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  010" id="25  010" >10</span>
 And Amasias separated from the army that came to him from Ephraim, that they might go away to their place; and they were very angry with Juda, and they returned to their place with great wrath.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  011" id="25  011" >11</span>
 And Amasias strengthened   himself  , and took his people, and went to the valley of salt, and struck there the children of Seir ten thousand.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  012" id="25  012" >12</span>
 And the children of Juda took ten thousand prisoners, and they carried them to the top of the precipice, and cast them headlong from the top of the precipice, and they were all dashed to pieces.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  013" id="25  013" >13</span>
 And the men of the host whom Amasias sent back so that they should not go with him to battle,   went   and attacked the cities of Juda, from Samaria to Baethoron; and they struck three thousand among them, and took much spoil.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  014" id="25  014" >14</span>
 And it came to pass, after Amasias had returned from striking Idumea, that he brought home the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up for himself as gods, and bowed down before them, and he sacrificed to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  015" id="25  015" >15</span>
 And the anger of the Lord came upon Amasias, and he sent him a prophet, and he said to him, Why have you sought the gods of the people, which have not rescued their own people out of your hand?  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  016" id="25  016" >16</span>
 And it came to pass when the prophet was speaking to him, that he said to him, have I made you king's counsellor? take heed lest you be scourged: and the prophet forebore, and said, I know that   God   is disposed against you to destroy you, because you have done this thing, and have not listened to my counsel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  017" id="25  017" >17</span>
 And Amasias king of Juda took counsel, and sent to Joas, son of Joachaz, son of Jeu, king of Israel, saying, Come, and let us look one another in the face.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  018" id="25  018" >18</span>
 And Joas king of Israel sent to Amasias king of Juda, saying, The thistle that was in Libanus sent to the cedar that was in Libanus, saying, Give your daughter to my son to wife; but, behold, your wild beasts of the field that are in Libanus shall come: and the wild beasts did come, and trod down the thistle.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  019" id="25  019" >19</span>
 You have said, Behold, I have struck Idumea, and your stout heart exalts you: now stay at home; for why do you implicate yourself in mischief, that you should fall, and Juda with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  020" id="25  020" >20</span>
 Nevertheless Amasias listened not, for it was of the Lord to deliver him into   the enemy's   hands, because he sought after the gods of the Idumeans.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  021" id="25  021" >21</span>
 So Joas king of Israel went up; and they saw one another, he and Amasias king of Juda, in Baethsamys, which is of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  022" id="25  022" >22</span>
 And Juda was put to flight before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  023" id="25  023" >23</span>
 And Joas king of Israel took prisoner Amasias king of Juda,   son   of Joas, son of Joachaz, in Baethsamys, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he pulled down   part   of the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  024" id="25  024" >24</span>
 And   he took   all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord and with Abdedom, and the treasures of the king's house, and the hostages, and he returned to Samaria.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  025" id="25  025" >25</span>
 And Amasias the   son   of Joas king of Juda lived after the death of Joas the   son   of Joachaz king of Israel fifteen years.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  026" id="25  026" >26</span>
 And the rest of the acts of Amasias, the first and the last, Behold! are they not written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel?  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  027" id="25  027" >27</span>
 And at the time when Amasias departed from the Lord, then they formed a conspiracy against him; and he fled from Jerusalem to Lachis: and they sent after him to Lachis, and killed him there.  <span class="verse" rel="v01425  028" id="25  028" >28</span>
 And they took him up on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of David.

<p><span class="chapter" id="26  001">26  </span> Then all the people of the land took Ozias, and he was sixteen years old, and they made him king in the room of his father Amasias.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  002" id="26  002" >2</span>
 He built Aelath, he recovered it to Juda, after the king slept with his fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  003" id="26  003" >3</span>
 Ozias began to reign at the age of sixteen years, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jechelia of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  004" id="26  004" >4</span>
 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Amasias his father did.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  005" id="26  005" >5</span>
 And he sought the Lord in the days of Zacharias, who understood the fear of the Lord; and in his days he sought the Lord, and the Lord prospered him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  006" id="26  006" >6</span>
 And he went out and fought against the Philistines, and pulled down the walls of Geth, and the walls of Jabner, and the walls of Azotus, and he built cities   near   Azotus, and among the Philistines.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  007" id="26  007" >7</span>
 And the Lord strengthened him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that lived on the rock, and against the Minaeans.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  008" id="26  008" >8</span>
 And the Minaeans gave gifts to Ozias; and his fame spread as far as the entering in of Egypt, for he strengthened   himself   exceedingly.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  009" id="26  009" >9</span>
 And Ozias built towers in Jerusalem, both at the gate of the corners, and at the valley gate, and at the corners and he fortified them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  010" id="26  010" >10</span>
 And he built towers in the wilderness, and dug many wells, for he had many cattle in the low country and in the plain; and vinedressers in the mountain country and in Carmel: for he was a husbandman.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  011" id="26  011" >11</span>
 And Ozias had a host of warriors, and that went out orderly to war, and returned orderly in number; and their number was   made   by the hand of Jeiel the scribe, and Maasias the judge, by the hand of Ananias the king's deputy.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  012" id="26  012" >12</span>
 The whole number of the chiefs of families of the mighty men of war   was   two thousand six hundred;  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  013" id="26  013" >13</span>
 and with them was a warrior force, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred: these waged war mightily to help the king against   his   enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  014" id="26  014" >14</span>
 And Ozias prepared for them,   even   for all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and breastplates, and bows, and slings for stones.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  015" id="26  015" >15</span>
 And he made in Jerusalem machines invented by a wise contriver, to be upon the towers and upon the corners, to cast darts and great stones: and   the fame   of their preparation was heard at a distance; for he was wonderfully helped, till he was strong.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  016" id="26  016" >16</span>
 And when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction; and he transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the temple of the Lord to turn incense on the altar of incense.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  017" id="26  017" >17</span>
 And there went in after him Azarias the priest, and with him eighty priests of the Lord, mighty men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  018" id="26  018" >18</span>
 And they withstood Ozias the king, and said to him,   It is   not for you, Ozias, to burn incense to the Lord, but only for the priests the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to sacrifice: go forth of the sanctuary, for you have departed from the Lord; and this shall not be for glory to you from the Lord god.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  019" id="26  019" >19</span>
 And Ozias was angry, and in his hand   was   the censer to burn incense in the temple: and when he was angry with the priests, then the leprosy rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the Lord, over the altar of incense.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  020" id="26  020" >20</span>
 And Azarias the chief priest, and the   other   priests, turned   to look   at him, and, behold, he   was   leprous in his forehead; and they got him hastily out thence, for he also hasted to go out, because the Lord had rebuked him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  021" id="26  021" >21</span>
 And Ozias the king was a leper to the day of his death, and he lived   as   a leper in a separate house; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord: and Joathan his son   was set   over his kingdom, judging the people of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  022" id="26  022" >22</span>
 And the rest of the acts of Ozias, the first and the last,   are   written by Jessias the prophet.  <span class="verse" rel="v01426  023" id="26  023" >23</span>
 And Ozias slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial   place   of the kings, for they said, He is a leper; and Joatham his son reigned in his stead.

 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father Ozias did: but he went not into the temple of the Lord. And still the people corrupted themselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v01427  003" id="27  003" >3</span>
 He built the high gate of the house of the Lord, and he built much in the wall of Opel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01427  004" id="27  004" >4</span>
 In the mountain of Juda, and in the woods,   he built   both dwelling-places and towers.  <span class="verse" rel="v01427  005" id="27  005" >5</span>
 He fought against the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against him: and the children of Ammon gave him even annually a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. These the king of the children of Ammon brought to him annually in the first and second and third years.  <span class="verse" rel="v01427  006" id="27  006" >6</span>
 Joatham grew strong, because he prepared his ways before the Lord his God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01427  7-8" id="27  7-8" >7-8</span>
 And the rest of the acts of Joatham, and his war, and his deeds, behold,   they are   written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01427  009" id="27  009" >9</span>

 But he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, for he made graven images.  <span class="verse" rel="v01428  003" id="28  003" >3</span>
 And   he sacrificed   to their idols in the valley of Benennom, and passed his children through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01428  004" id="28  004" >4</span>

 And the Lord his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and he struck him, and took captive of them a great band of prisoners, and carried him to Damascus.

 And there was there a prophet of the Lord, his name   was   Oded: and he went out to meet the host that were coming to Samaria, and said to them, Behold, the wrath of the Lord God of your fathers   is   upon Juda, and he has delivered them into your hands, and you° have slain them in wrath, and it has reached even to heaven.  <span class="verse" rel="v01428  010" id="28  010" >10</span>

 and said to them, You° shall not bring in hither the prisoners to us, for whereas sin against the Lord   is   upon us, you° mean to add to our sins, and to our trespass: for our sin   is   great, and the fierce anger of the Lord   is   upon Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01428  014" id="28  014" >14</span>
 So the warriors left the prisoners and the spoils before the princes and all the congregation.  <span class="verse" rel="v01428  015" id="28  015" >15</span>

 Also the Philistines had made an attack on the cities of the plain country, and the cities of the south of Juda, and taken Baethsamys, and   the things in the house of the Lord, and the things in the house of the king, and of the princes: and they gave to the king   Aelon, and Galero, and Socho and her villages, and Thamna and her villages, and Gamzo and her villages: and they lived there.  <span class="verse" rel="v01428  019" id="28  019" >19</span>
 For the Lord humbled Juda because of Achaz king of Juda, because he grievously departed from the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01428  020" id="28  020" >20</span>
 And there came against him Thalgaphellasar king of Assyria, and he afflicted him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01428  021" id="28  021" >21</span>
 And Achaz took the things   that were   in the house of the Lord, and the things in the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave them to the king of Assyria: but he was no help to him,  <span class="verse" rel="v01428  022" id="28  022" >22</span>
 but only   troubled him   in his affliction: and he departed yet more from the Lord, and king Achaz said,  <span class="verse" rel="v01428  023" id="28  023" >23</span>
 I will seek after the gods of Damascus that strike me. And he said, Forasmuch as the gods of the king of Syria themselves strengthen them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, and they will help me. But they became a stumbling block to him, and to all Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01428  024" id="28  024" >24</span>
 And Achaz removed the vessels of the house of the Lord, and cut them in pieces, and shut the doors of the house of the Lord, and made to himself altars in every corner in Jerusalem:  <span class="verse" rel="v01428  025" id="28  025" >25</span>
 and in each several city in Juda he made high places to burn incense to strange gods: and they provoked the Lord God of their fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v01428  026" id="28  026" >26</span>
 And the rest of his acts, and his deeds, the first and the last, behold,   they are   written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01428  027" id="28  027" >27</span>
 And Achaz slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David; for they did not bring him into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Ezekias his son reigned in his stead.

<p><span class="chapter" id="29  001">29  </span> And Ezekias began to reign at the age of twenty-five years, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Abia, daughter of Zacharias.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  002" id="29  002" >2</span>
 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father David had done.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  003" id="29  003" >3</span>
 And it came to pass, when he was established over his kingdom, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the Lord, and repaired them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  004" id="29  004" >4</span>
 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and put them on the east side,  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  005" id="29  005" >5</span>
 and said to them, Hear, you° Levites: now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of the Lord God of your fathers, and cast out the impurity from the holy places.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  006" id="29  006" >6</span>
 For our fathers have revolted, and done that which was evil before the Lord our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their face from the tabernacle of the Lord, and have turned   their   back.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  007" id="29  007" >7</span>
 And they have shut up the doors of the temple, and put out the lamps, and have not burnt incense, and have not offered whole burnt offerings in the holy   place   to the God of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  008" id="29  008" >8</span>
 And the Lord was very angry with Juda and Jerusalem, and made them an astonishment, and a desolation, and a hissing, as you° see with your eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  009" id="29  009" >9</span>
 And, behold, your fathers have been struck with the sword, and your sons and your daughters and your wives are in captivity in a land not their own, as it is even now.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  010" id="29  010" >10</span>
 Therefore it is now in my heart to make a covenant, a covenant with the Lord God of Israel, that he may turn away his fierce wrath from us.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  011" id="29  011" >11</span>
 And now be not lacking   to your duty  , for the Lord has chosen you to stand before him to minister, and to be ministers and burners of incense to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  012" id="29  012" >12</span>
 Then the Levites rose up, Maath the son of Amasi, and Joel the son of Azarias, of the sons of Caath: and of the sons of Merari, Kis the son of Abdi, and Azarias the son of Haelel: and of the sons of Gedsoni, Jodaad the son of Zemmath, and Joadam: these   were   the sons of Joacha.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  013" id="29  013" >13</span>
 And of the sons of Elisaphan; Zambri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zacharias, and Matthanias:  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  014" id="29  014" >14</span>
 and of the sons of Aeman; Jeiel, and Semei: and of the sons of Idithun; Samaisa, and Oziel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  015" id="29  015" >15</span>
 And they gathered their brethren, and they purified themselves according to the king's command by the order of the Lord, to purify the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  016" id="29  016" >16</span>
 And the priests entered into the house of the Lord, to purify   it  , and they cast out all the uncleanness that was found in the house of the Lord, even into the court of the house of the Lord: and the Levites received   it   to cast into the brook of Kedron without.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  017" id="29  017" >17</span>
 And   Ezekias   began on the first day,   even   on the new moon of the first month, to purify, and on the eighth day of the month they entered into the temple of the Lord: and they purified the house of the Lord in eight days; and on the thirteenth day of the first month they finished   the work  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  018" id="29  018" >18</span>
 And they went in to king Ezekias, and said, We have purified all the things in the house of the Lord, the altar of whole burnt offering, and its vessels, and the table of show-bread, and its vessels;  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  019" id="29  019" >19</span>
 and all the vessels which king Achaz polluted in his reign, in his apostasy, we have prepared and purified: behold, they are before the altar of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  020" id="29  020" >20</span>
 And king Ezekias rose early in the morning, and gathered the chief men of the city, and went up to the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  021" id="29  021" >21</span>
 And he brought seven calves, seven rams, seven lambs, seven kids of goats for a sin-offering, for the kingdom, and for the holy things, and for Israel: and he told the priests the sons of Aaron to go up to the altar of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  022" id="29  022" >22</span>
 And they killed the calves, and the priests received the blood, and poured it on the altar: and they killed the rams, and poured the blood upon the altar: also they killed the lambs, and poured the blood round the altar.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  023" id="29  023" >23</span>
 And they brought the goats for a sin-offering before the king and the congregation; and laid their hands upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  024" id="29  024" >24</span>
 And the priests killed them, and offered their blood as a propitiation on the altar; and they made atonement for all Israel: for the king said, The whole burnt offering, and the sin-offering   are   for all Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  025" id="29  025" >25</span>
 And he stationed the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals, and lutes, and harps, according to the commandment of king David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for by the commandment of the Lord the order   was   in the hand of the prophets.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  026" id="29  026" >26</span>
 And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  027" id="29  027" >27</span>
 And Ezekias told   them   to offer up the whole burnt offering on the altar: and when they began to offer the whole burnt offering, they began to sing to the Lord, and the trumpets   accompanied   the instruments of David king of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  028" id="29  028" >28</span>
 And all the congregation worshipped, and the psalm-singers   were   singing, and the trumpets sounding, until the whole burnt sacrifice had been completely offered.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  029" id="29  029" >29</span>
 And when they had done offering   it  , the king and all that were present bowed, and worshipped.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  030" id="29  030" >30</span>
 And king Ezekias and the princes told the Levites to sing hymns to the Lord in the words of David, and of Asaph the prophet: and they sang hymns with gladness, and fell down and worshipped.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  031" id="29  031" >31</span>
 Then Ezekias answered and said, Now you° have consecrated yourselves to the Lord, bring near and offer sacrifices of praise in the house of the Lord. And the congregation brought sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of the Lord; and every one who was ready in his heart   brought   whole burnt offerings.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  032" id="29  032" >32</span>
 And the number of the whole burnt offerings which the congregation brought, was seventy calves, a hundred rams, two hundred lambs: all these   were   for a whole burnt offering to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  033" id="29  033" >33</span>
 And the consecrated calves were six hundred,   and   the sheep three thousand.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  034" id="29  034" >34</span>
 But the priests were few, and could not flay the whole burnt offering, so their brethren the Levites helped them, until the work was finished, and until the priests had purified themselves: for the Levites   more   zealously purified   themselves   than the priests.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  035" id="29  035" >35</span>
 And the whole burnt offering   was   abundant, with the fat of the complete peace-offering, and the drink-offerings of the whole burnt sacrifice. So the service was established in the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01429  036" id="29  036" >36</span>
 And Ezekias and all the people rejoiced, because God has prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.  
<!-- 30   036 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="30  001">30  </span> And Ezekias sent to all Israel and Juda, and wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasse, that they should come into the house of the Lord to Jerusalem, to keep the passover to the Lord God of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  002" id="30  002" >2</span>
 For the king, and the princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, designed to keep the passover in the second month.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  003" id="30  003" >3</span>
 For they could not keep it at that time, because a sufficient number of priest had not purified themselves, and the people was not gathered to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  004" id="30  004" >4</span>
 And the proposal pleased the king and the congregation.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  005" id="30  005" >5</span>
 And they established a decree that a proclamation should go through all Israel, from Bersabee to Dan, that they should come and keep the passover to the Lord God of Israel at Jerusalem: for the multitude had not done it lately according to the scripture.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  006" id="30  006" >6</span>
 And the posts went with the letters from the king and the princes to all Israel and Juda, according to the command of the king, saying, Children of Israel, return to the Lord God of Abraam, and Isaac, and Israel, and bring back them that have escaped   even   those that were left of the hand of the king of Assyria.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  007" id="30  007" >7</span>
 And be not as your fathers, and your brethren, who revolted from the Lord God of their fathers, and he gave them up to desolation, as you° see.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  008" id="30  008" >8</span>
 And now harden not your hearts, as your fathers   did  : give glory to the Lord God, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified for ever: and serve the Lord your God, and he shall turn away   his   fierce anger from you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  009" id="30  009" >9</span>
 For when you° turn to the Lord, your brethren and your children shall be pitied before all that have carried them captives, and he will restore   you   to this land: for the Lord our God is merciful and pitiful, and will not turn away his face from you, if we return to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  010" id="30  010" >10</span>
 So the posts went through from city to city in mount Ephraim, and Manasse, and as far as Zabulon: and they as it were laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  011" id="30  011" >11</span>
 But the men of Aser, and   some   of Manasses and of Zabulon, were ashamed, and came to Jerusalem and Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  012" id="30  012" >12</span>
 And the hand of the Lord was   present   to give them one heart to come, to do according to the commands of the king and of the princes, by the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  013" id="30  013" >13</span>
 And a great multitude were gathered to Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  014" id="30  014" >14</span>
 And they arose, and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all on which they burnt incense to false   gods   they tore down and cast into the brook Kedron.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  015" id="30  015" >15</span>
 Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites repented, and purified   themselves  , and brought whole burnt offerings into the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  016" id="30  016" >16</span>
 And they stood at their post, according to their ordinance, according to the commandment of Moses the man of God: and the priests received the blood from the hand of the Levites.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  017" id="30  017" >17</span>
 For a great part of the congregation was not sanctified; and the Levites were   ready   to kill the passover for every one who could not sanctify himself to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  018" id="30  018" >18</span>
 For the greatest part of the people of Ephraim, and Manasse, and Issachar, and Zabulon, had not purified   themselves  , but ate the passover contrary to the scripture. On this account also Ezekias prayed concerning them, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  019" id="30  019" >19</span>
 The good Lord be merciful with regard to every heart that sincerely seeks the Lord God of their fathers, and   is   not   purified   according to the purification of the sanctuary.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  020" id="30  020" >20</span>
 And the Lord listened to Ezekias, and healed the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  021" id="30  021" >21</span>
 And the children of Israel who were present in Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great joy; and they continued to sing hymns to the Lord daily, and the priests and the Levites   played   on instruments to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  022" id="30  022" >22</span>
 And Ezekias encouraged all the Levites, and those that had good understanding of the Lord: and they completely kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days, offering peace-offerings, and confessing to the Lord God of their fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  023" id="30  023" >23</span>
 And the congregation purposed together to keep other seven days: and they kept seven days with gladness.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  024" id="30  024" >24</span>
 For Ezekias set apart for Juda,   even   for the congregation, a thousand calves and seven thousand sheep; and the princes set apart for the people a thousand calves and ten thousand sheep: and the holy things of the priests abundantly.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  025" id="30  025" >25</span>
 And all the congregation, the priests and the Levites, rejoiced, and all the congregation of Juda, and they that were present of Jerusalem, and the strangers that came from the land of Israel, and the dwellers in Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  026" id="30  026" >26</span>
 And there was great joy in Jerusalem: from the days of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not such a feast in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01430  027" id="30  027" >27</span>
 Then the priests the Levites rose up and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came into his holy dwelling-place,   even   into heaven.  
<!-- 31   027 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="31  001">31  </span> And when all these things were finished, all Israel that were found in the cities of Juda went out, and broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the groves, and tore down the high places and the altars out of all Judea and Benjamin, also of Ephraim and Manasse, till they made an end: and all Israel returned, every one to his inheritance, and to their cities.  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  002" id="31  002" >2</span>
 And Ezekias appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites, and the courses of each one according to his ministry, to the priests and to the Levites, for the whole burnt offering, and for the peace-offering, and to praise, and to give thanks, and to minister in the gates,   and   in the courts of the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  003" id="31  003" >3</span>
 And the king's proportion out of his substance   was appointed   for the whole burnt offerings, the morning and the evening one, and the whole burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the feasts that were ordered in the law of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  004" id="31  004" >4</span>
 And they told the people who lived in Jerusalem, to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be strong in the ministry of the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  005" id="31  005" >5</span>
 And as he gave the command, Israel brought abundantly first fruits of corn, and wine, and oil, and honey, and every fruit of the field: and the children of Israel and Juda brought tithes of everything abundantly.  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  006" id="31  006" >6</span>
 And they that lived in the cities of Juda themselves also brought tithes of calves and sheep, and tithes of goats, and consecrated them to the Lord their God, and they brought them and laid them in heaps.  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  007" id="31  007" >7</span>
 In the third month the heaps began to be piled, and in the seventh month they were finished.  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  008" id="31  008" >8</span>
 And Ezekias and the princes came and saw the heaps, and blessed the Lord, and his people Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  009" id="31  009" >9</span>
 Then Ezekias enquired of the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  010" id="31  010" >10</span>
 And Azarias the priest, the chief over the house of Sadoc, spoke to him, and said, From the time that the first fruits began to be brought into the house of the Lord, we have eaten and drunk, and left even abundantly; for the Lord has blessed his people, and we have left to this amount.  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  011" id="31  011" >11</span>
 And Ezekias told them yet farther to prepare chambers for the house of the Lord; and they prepared   them  ,  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  012" id="31  012" >12</span>
 and they brought there the first fruits and the tithes faithfully: and Chonenias the Levite was superintendent over them, and Semei his brother was next.  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  013" id="31  013" >13</span>
 and Jeiel, and Ozias, and Naeth, and Asael, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Samachia, and Maath, and Banaias, and his sons, were appointed by Chonenias and Semei his brother, as Ezekias the king, and Azarias who was over the house of the Lord commanded.  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  014" id="31  014" >14</span>
 And Core, the   son   of Jemna the Levite, the porter eastward,   was   over the gifts, to distribute the first fruits of the Lord, and the most holy things,  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  015" id="31  015" >15</span>
 by the hand of Odom, and Benjamin, and Jesus, and Semei, and Amarias, and Sechonias, by the hand of the priests faithfully, to give to their brethren according to the courses, as well to great as small;  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  016" id="31  016" >16</span>
 besides the increase of males from three years old and upward, to every one entering into the house of the Lord,   a portion   according to a daily rate, for service in the daily courses of their order.  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  017" id="31  017" >17</span>
 This   is   the distribution of the priests according to the houses of their families; and the Levites in their daily courses from twenty years old and upward   were   in   their   order,  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  018" id="31  018" >18</span>
 to assign stations for all the increase of their sons and their daughters, for the whole number: for they faithfully sanctified the holy place.  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  019" id="31  019" >19</span>
 As for the sons of Aaron that executed the priests' office, —even those from their cities the men in each several city who were named expressly, —  were appointed   to give a portion to every male among the priests, and to every one reckoned among the Levites.  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  020" id="31  020" >20</span>
 And Ezekias did so through all Juda, and did that which was good and right before the Lord his God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01431  021" id="31  021" >21</span>
 And in every work which he began in service in the house of the Lord, and in the law, and in the ordinances, he sought his God with all his soul, and wrought, and prospered.

<p><span class="chapter" id="32  001">32  </span> And after these things and this faithful dealing, came Sennacherim king of the Assyrians, and he came to Juda, and encamped against the fortified cities, and intended to take them for himself.  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  002" id="32  002" >2</span>

 And he appointed captains of war over the people, and they were gathered to   meet   him to the open place of the gate of the valley, and he encouraged them, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  007" id="32  007" >7</span>
 Be strong and courageous, and fear not, neither be dismayed before the King of Assyria, and before all the nation that   is   with him: for   there are   more with us than with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  008" id="32  008" >8</span>
 With him   are   arms of flesh; but with us   is   the Lord our God to save   us  , and to fight our battle. And the people were encouraged at the words of Ezekias king of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  009" id="32  009" >9</span>
 And afterward Sennacherim king of the Assyrians sent his servants to Jerusalem; and   he went   himself against Lachis, and all his army with him, and sent to Ezekias king of Juda, and to all Juda that   was   in Jerusalem, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  010" id="32  010" >10</span>
 Thus says Sennacherim king of the Assyrians, On what do you° trust, that you° will remain in the siege in Jerusalem?  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  011" id="32  011" >11</span>
 Does not Ezekias deceive you, to deliver you to death and famine and thirst, saying, The Lord our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  012" id="32  012" >12</span>
 Is not this Ezekias who has taken down his altars and his high places and has spoken to Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem, saying, You° shall worship before this altar and burn incense upon it?  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  013" id="32  013" >13</span>
 Know you° not what I and my fathers have done to all the nations of the countries? Could the gods of the nations of all the earth at all rescue their people out of my hand?  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  014" id="32  014" >14</span>
 Who is there among all the gods of those nations whom my fathers utterly destroyed,   worthy of trust  ? Could they deliver their people out of my hand, that your God should deliver you out of my hand?  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  015" id="32  015" >15</span>
 Now then, let not Ezekias deceive you, and let him not make you thus confident, and believe him not: for no god of any kingdom or nation is at all able to deliver his people out of my hand, or the hand of my fathers: therefore your God shall not deliver you out of my hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  016" id="32  016" >16</span>
 And his servants continued to speak against the Lord God, and against his servant Ezekias.  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  017" id="32  017" >17</span>
 And he wrote a letter to reproach the Lord God of Israel, and spoke concerning him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the earth have not delivered their people out of my hand, so the God of Ezekias shall by no means deliver his people out of my hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  018" id="32  018" >18</span>
 And he cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language to the people of Jerusalem on the wall,   calling them   to assist them, and pull down   the walls  , that they might take the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  019" id="32  019" >19</span>
 And he spoke against the God of Jerusalem, even as against the gods of the nations of the earth, the works of the hands of men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  020" id="32  020" >20</span>
 And king Ezekias and Esaias the prophet the son of Amos prayed concerning these things, and they cried to heaven.  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  021" id="32  021" >21</span>
 And the Lord sent an angel, and he destroyed every mighty man and warrior, and leader and captain in the camp of the king of Assyria: and he returned with shame of face to his own land and came into the house of his god: and   some   of them that came out of his bowels killed him with the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  022" id="32  022" >22</span>
 So the Lord delivered Ezekias and the dwellers in Jerusalem out of the hand of Sennacherim King of Assyria, and out of the hand of all   his enemies  , and gave them rest round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  023" id="32  023" >23</span>
 And many brought gifts to the Lord to Jerusalem, and presents to Ezekias king of Juda; and he was exalted in the eyes of all the nations after these things.  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  024" id="32  024" >24</span>
 In those days Ezekias was sick even to death, and prayed to the Lord: and he listened to him, and gave him a sign.  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  025" id="32  025" >25</span>
 But Ezekias did not recompense the Lord according to the return which he made him, but his heart was lifted up: and wrath came upon him, and upon Juda and Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  026" id="32  026" >26</span>
 And Ezekias humbled himself after the exaltation of his heart, he and the dwellers in Jerusalem; and the wrath of the Lord did not come upon them in the days of Ezekias.  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  027" id="32  027" >27</span>
 And Ezekias had wealth and very great glory: and he made for himself treasuries of gold, and silver, and precious stones, also for spices, and stores for arms, and for precious vessels;  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  028" id="32  028" >28</span>
 and cities for the produce of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls and mangers for every   kind of   cattle, and folds for flocks;  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  029" id="32  029" >29</span>
 and cities which he built for himself, and store of sheep and oxen in abundance, for the Lord gave him a very great store.  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  030" id="32  030" >30</span>
 The same Ezekias stopped up the course of the water of Gion above, and brought the water down straight south of the city of David. And Ezekias prospered in all his works.  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  031" id="32  031" >31</span>
 Notwithstanding, in regard to the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who were sent to him to enquire of him   concerning   the prodigy which came upon the land, the Lord left him, to try him, to know what was in his heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  032" id="32  032" >32</span>
 And the rest of the acts of Ezekias, and his kindness, behold, they are written in the prophecy of Esaias the son of Amos the prophet, and in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01432  033" id="32  033" >33</span>
 And Ezekias slept with his fathers, and they buried him in a high place among the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem gave him glory and honor at his death. And Manasses his son reigned in his stead.  
<!-- 33   033 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="33  001">33  </span> Manasses was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  002" id="33  002" >2</span>
 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord destroyed from before the face of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  003" id="33  003" >3</span>
 And he returned and built the high places, which his father Ezekias had pulled down, and set up images to Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  004" id="33  004" >4</span>
 And he built altars in the house of the Lord, concerning which the Lord said, In Jerusalem shall be my name for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  005" id="33  005" >5</span>
 And he built altars to all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  006" id="33  006" >6</span>
 He also passed his children through the fire in the valley of Benennom; and he divined, and used auspices, and sorceries, and appointed those who had divining spirits, and enchanters, and wrought abundant wickedness before the Lord, to provoke him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  007" id="33  007" >7</span>
 And he set the graven   image  , the molten   statue  , the idol which he made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name for ever;  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  008" id="33  008" >8</span>
 and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I gave to their fathers, if only they will take heed to do all things which I have commanded them, according to all the law and the ordinances and the judgments   given   by the hand of Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  009" id="33  009" >9</span>
 So Manasses led astray Juda and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to do evil beyond all the nations which the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  010" id="33  010" >10</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Manasses, and to his people: but they listened not.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  011" id="33  011" >11</span>
 And the Lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, and they took Manasses in bonds, and bound him in fetters, and brought him to Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  012" id="33  012" >12</span>
 And when he was afflicted, he sought the face of the Lord his God, and was greatly humbled before the face of the God of his fathers;  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  013" id="33  013" >13</span>
 and he prayed to him: and he listened to him, and listened to his cry, and brought him back to Jerusalem to his kingdom: and Manasses knew that the Lord he is God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  014" id="33  014" >14</span>
 And afterward he built a wall without the city of David, from the southwest southward in the valleys and at the entrance through the fish-gate, as men go out by the gate round about, even as far as Opel: and he raised it much, and set captains of the host in all the fortified cities in Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  015" id="33  015" >15</span>
 And he removed the strange gods, and the graven   image   out of the house of the Lord, and all the altars which he had built in the mount of the house of the Lord, and in Jerusalem, and without the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  016" id="33  016" >16</span>
 And he repaired the altar of the Lord, and offered upon it a sacrifice of peace-offering and thank-offering, and he told Juda to serve the Lord God of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  017" id="33  017" >17</span>
 Nevertheless the people still sacrificed on the high places, only to the Lord their God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  018" id="33  018" >18</span>
 And the rest of the acts of Manasses, and his prayer to God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the God of Israel,  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  019" id="33  019" >19</span>
 behold,   they are   in the account of his prayer; and   God   listened to him. And all his sins, and his backslidings, and the spots on which he built the high places, and set there groves and graven images, before he repented, behold, they are written in the books of the seers.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  020" id="33  020" >20</span>
 And Manasses slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the garden of his house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  021" id="33  021" >21</span>
 Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  022" id="33  022" >22</span>
 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his father Manasses did: and Amon sacrificed to all the idols which his father Manasses had made, and served them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  023" id="33  023" >23</span>
 And he was not humbled before the Lord as his father Manasses was humbled; for his son Amon abounded in transgression.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  024" id="33  024" >24</span>
 And his servants conspired against him, and killed him in his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01433  025" id="33  025" >25</span>
 And the people of the land killed the men who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josias his son king in his stead.

<p><span class="chapter" id="34  001">34  </span> Josias was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  002" id="34  002" >2</span>
 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of his father David, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  003" id="34  003" >3</span>
 And in the eighth year of his reign, and he   being   yet a youth, he began to seek the Lord God of his father David: and in the twelfth year of his reign he began to purge Juda and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the ornaments for the altars, and the molten images.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  004" id="34  004" >4</span>
 And he pulled down the altars of Baalim that were before his face, and the high places that were above them; and he cut down the groves, and the graven images, and broke in pieces the molten images, and reduced them to powder, and cast   it   upon the surface of the tombs of those who   had   sacrificed to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  005" id="34  005" >5</span>
 And he burnt the bones of the priests upon the altars, and purged Juda and Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  006" id="34  006" >6</span>
 And   he did so   in the cities of Manasse, and Ephraim, and Symeon, and Nephthali, and the places round about them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  007" id="34  007" >7</span>
 And he pulled down the altars and the groves, and he cut the idols in small pieces, and cut off all the high places from all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  008" id="34  008" >8</span>
 And in the eighteenth year of his reign, after having cleansed the land, and the house, he sent Saphan the son of Ezelias, and Maasa prefect of the city, and Juach son of Joachaz his recorder, to repair the house of the Lord his God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  009" id="34  009" >9</span>
 And they came to Chelcias the high priest, and gave the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites who kept the gate collected of the hand of Manasse and Ephraim, and of the princes, and of every one that was left in Israel, and of the children of Juda and Benjamin, and of the dwellers in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  010" id="34  010" >10</span>
 And they gave it into the hand of the workmen, who were appointed in the house of the Lord, and they gave it to the workmen who wrought in the house of the Lord, to repair and strengthen the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  011" id="34  011" >11</span>
 They gave   it   also to the carpenters and builders, to buy squared stones, and timber for beams to cover the houses which the kings of Juda had destroyed.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  012" id="34  012" >12</span>
 And the men   were   faithfully   engaged   in the works: and over them were superintendents, Jeth and Abdias, Levites of the sons of Merari, and Zacharias and Mosollam, of the sons of Caath,   appointed   to oversee; and every Levite, and every one that understood   how   to play on musical instruments.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  013" id="34  013" >13</span>
 And   overseers were   over the burden-bearers, and over all the workmen in the respective works; and of the Levites   were appointed   scribes, and judges, and porters.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  014" id="34  014" >14</span>
 And when they brought forth the money that had been brought into the house of the Lord, Chelcias the priest found a book of the law of the Lord   given   by the hand of Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  015" id="34  015" >15</span>
 And Chelcias answered and said to Saphan the scribe, I have found a book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Chelcias gave the book to Saphan.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  016" id="34  016" >16</span>
 And Saphan brought in the book to the king, and moreover gave an account to the king,   saying, This is   all the money given into the hand of your servants that work.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  017" id="34  017" >17</span>
 And they have collected the money that was found in the house of the Lord, and given it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of them that do the work.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  018" id="34  018" >18</span>
 And Saphan the scribe brought word to the king, saying, Chelcias the priest has given me a book. And Saphan read it before the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  019" id="34  019" >19</span>
 And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the law, that he tore his garments.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  020" id="34  020" >20</span>
 And the king commanded Chelcias, and Achicam the son of Saphan, and Abdom the son of Michaias, and Saphan the scribe, and Asia the servant of the king, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  021" id="34  021" >21</span>
 Go, enquire of the Lord for me, and for every one that is left in Israel and Juda, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the Lord   which   has been kindled among us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of the Lord, to do according to all the things written in this book.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  022" id="34  022" >22</span>
 And Chelcias went, and   the others   whom the king told, to Olda the prophetess, the wife of Sellem son of Thecoe, son of Aras, who kept the commandments; and she lived in Jerusalem in the second   quarter  : and they spoke to her accordingly.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  023" id="34  023" >23</span>
 And she said to them, Thus has the Lord God of Israel said, Tell the man who sent you to me,  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  024" id="34  024" >24</span>
 Thus says the Lord, Behold, I bring evil upon this place,   even   all the words that are written in the book that was read before the king of Juda:  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  025" id="34  025" >25</span>
 because they have forsaken me, and burnt incense to strange gods, that they might provoke me by all the works of their hands; and my wrath is kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  026" id="34  026" >26</span>
 And concerning the king of Juda, who sent you to seek the Lord, —thus shall you° say to him, Thus says the Lord God of Israel,   As for   the words which you have heard,  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  027" id="34  027" >27</span>
 forasmuch as your heart was ashamed, and you was humbled before me when you heard my words against this place, and against the inhabitants of it, and you were humbled before me, and did rend your garments, and did weep before me; I also have heard, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  028" id="34  028" >28</span>
 Behold, I   will   gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not look upon all the evils which I am bringing upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of it. And they brought back word to the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  029" id="34  029" >29</span>
 And the king sent and gathered the elders of Juda and Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  030" id="34  030" >30</span>
 And the king went up to the house of the Lord,   he   and all Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that were found in the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  031" id="34  031" >31</span>
 And the king stood at a pillar, and made a covenant before the Lord, to walk before the Lord, to keep his commandments and testimonies, and his ordinances, with all   his   heart and with all   his   soul, so as to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  032" id="34  032" >32</span>
 And he caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand; and the inhabitants of Jerusalem made a covenant in the house of the Lord God of their fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v01434  033" id="34  033" >33</span>
 And Josias removed all the abominations out of the whole land which belonged to the children of Israel, and caused all that were found in Jerusalem and in Israel, to serve the Lord their God all his days: he departed not from following the Lord God of his fathers.

<p><span class="chapter" id="35  001">35  </span> And Josias kept a passover to the Lord his God; and sacrificed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  002" id="35  002" >2</span>
 And he appointed the priests at their charges, and encouraged them for the services of the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  003" id="35  003" >3</span>
 And he told the Levites that were able   to act   in all Israel, that they should consecrate themselves to the Lord: and they put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built: and the king said, You° must not carry anything on your shoulders: now then minister to the Lord your God, and to his people Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  004" id="35  004" >4</span>
 And prepare yourselves according to the houses of your families, and according to your daily courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and   the order   by the hand of his son Solomon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  005" id="35  005" >5</span>
 And stand you° in the house according to the divisions of the houses of your families for your brethren the sons of the people;   so   also let there be for the Levites a division of the house of their family.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  006" id="35  006" >6</span>
 And kill you° the passover, and prepare   it   for your brethren, to do according to the word of the Lord, by the hand of Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  007" id="35  007" >7</span>
 And Josias gave as an offering to the children of the people, sheep, and lambs, and kids of the young of the goats, all for the passover,   even for   all that were found, in number   amounting to   thirty thousand, and three thousand calves, these   were   of the substance of the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  008" id="35  008" >8</span>
 And his princes gave an offering to the people, and to the priests, and to the Levites: and Chelcias and Zacharias and Jeiel the chief men gave to the priests of the house of God, they even gave for the passover sheep, and lambs, and kids, two thousand six hundred, and three hundred calves.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  009" id="35  009" >9</span>
 And Chonenias, and Banaeas, and Samaeas, and Nathanael his brother, and Asabias, and Jeiel, and Jozabad, heads of the Levites, gave an offering to the Levites for the passover, of five thousand sheep and five hundred calves.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  010" id="35  010" >10</span>

 And thus   they did   till the morning. And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance; and boiled the holy   pieces   in copper vessels and caldrons, and   the feast   went on well, and they quickly served all the children of the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  014" id="35  014" >14</span>
 And after they had prepared for themselves and for the priests, for the priests   were engaged   in offering the whole burnt offerings and the fat until night, then the Levites prepared for themselves, and for their brethren the sons of Aaron.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  015" id="35  015" >15</span>
 And the sons of Asaph the psalm-singers   were   at their post according to the commands of David, and Asaph, and Aeman, and Idithom, the prophets of the king: also, the chiefs and the porters of the several gates; —it was not for them to stir from the service of the holy things, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  016" id="35  016" >16</span>
 So all the service of the Lord was duly ordered and prepared in that day, for keeping the passover, and offering the whole burnt sacrifices on the altar of the Lord, according to the command of king Josias.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  017" id="35  017" >17</span>
 And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  018" id="35  018" >18</span>
 And there was no passover like it in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet, or any king of Israel: they kept not such a passover as Josias, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Juda and Israel that were present, and the dwellers in Jerusalem, kept to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  019" id="35  019" >19</span>
 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias this passover was kept, after all these things that Josias did in the house. And king Josias burnt those who had in them a divining spirit, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and the sodomites which were in the land of Juda and in Jerusalem, that he might confirm the words of the law that were written in the book which Chelcias the priest found in the house of the Lord. There was no   king   like him before him, who turned to the Lord with all his heart, and all his soul, and all his strength, according to all the law of Moses, and after him there rose up none like him. Nevertheless the Lord turned not from the anger of his fierce wrath, wherewith the Lord was greatly angry against Juda, for all the provocations wherewith Manasses provoked him: and the Lord said, I will even remove Juda also from my presence, as I have removed Israel, and I have rejected the city which I chose,   even   Jerusalem, and thehouse of which I said, My name shall be there.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  020" id="35  020" >20</span>
 And Pharao Nechao king of Egypt went up against the king of the Assyrians to the river Euphrates, and king Josias went to meet him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  021" id="35  021" >21</span>
 And he sent messengers to him, saying, What have I to do with you, O king of Juda? I am not come today to war against you; and God has told me to hasten: beware of the God that is with me, lest he destroy you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  022" id="35  022" >22</span>
 However, Josias turned not his face from him, but strengthened himself to fight against him, and listened not to the words of Nechao by the mouth of God, and he came to fight in the plain of Mageddo.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  023" id="35  023" >23</span>
 And the archers shot at king Josias; and the king said to his servants, Take me away, for I am severely wounded.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  024" id="35  024" >24</span>
 And his servants lifted him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot which he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried with his fathers: and all Juda and Jerusalem lamented over Josias.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  025" id="35  025" >25</span>
 And Jeremias mourned over Josias, and all the chief men and chief women uttered a lamentation over Josias until this day: and they made it an ordinance for Israel, and, behold, it is written in the lamentations.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  026" id="35  026" >26</span>
 And the rest of the acts of Josias, and his hope, are written in the law of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01435  027" id="35  027" >27</span>
 And his acts, the first and the last, behold,   they are   written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

<p><span class="chapter" id="36  001">36  </span> And the people of the land took Joachaz the son of Josias, and anointed him, and made him king over Jerusalem in the room of his father.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  002" id="36  002" >2</span>
 Joachaz   was   twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Amital, daughter of Jeremias of Lobna. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done. And Pharao Nechao bound him in Deblatha in the land of Aemath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  003" id="36  003" >3</span>
 And the king brought him over to Egypt; and imposed a tribute on the land, a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  004" id="36  004" >4</span>
 And Pharao Nechao made Eliakim the son of Josias king over Juda in the room of his father Josias, and changed his name   to   Joakim. And Pharao Nechao took his brother Joachaz and brought him into Egypt, and he died there: but   he   had given the silver and gold to Pharao. At that time the land began to be taxed to give the money at the command of Pharao; and every one as he could borrowed the silver and the gold of the people of the land, to give to Pharao Nechao.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  005" id="36  005" >5</span>
 Joachim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name   was   Zechora, daughter of Nerias of Rama. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers did. In his days came Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon into the land, and he served him three years, and   then   revolted from him. And the Lord sent against them the Chaldeans, and plundering parties of Syrians, and plundering parties of the Moabites, and of the children of Ammon, and of Samaria; but after this they departed, according to the word of the Lord by the hand of his servants the prophets. Nevertheless the wrath of the Lord was upon Juda, so that they should be removed from his presence, because of the sins of Manasses in all that he did, and for the innocent blood which Joakim shed, for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; yet the Lord would not utterly destroy them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  006" id="36  006" >6</span>
 And Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him with brazen fetters, and carried him away to Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  007" id="36  007" >7</span>
 And he carried away a part of the vessels of the house of the Lord to Babylon, and put them in his temple in Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  008" id="36  008" >8</span>
 And the rest of the acts of Joakim, and all that he did, behold,   are   not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? And Joakim slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in Ganozae: and Jechonias his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  009" id="36  009" >9</span>
 Jechonias   was   eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem, and did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  010" id="36  010" >10</span>
 And at the turn of the year, king Nabuchodonosor sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the precious vessels of the house of the Lord, and made Sedekias his father's brother king over Juda and Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  011" id="36  011" >11</span>
 Sedekias   was   twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and be reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  012" id="36  012" >12</span>
 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God: he was not ashamed before the prophet Jeremias, nor because of the word of the Lord;  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  013" id="36  013" >13</span>
 in that he rebelled against king Nabuchodonosor, which he adjured him by God   not to do  : but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart, so as not to return to the Lord God of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  014" id="36  014" >14</span>
 And all the great men of Juda, and the priests, and the people of the land transgressed abundantly in the abominations of the heathen, and polluted the house of the Lord which   was   in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  015" id="36  015" >15</span>
 And the Lord God of their fathers sent by the hand of his prophets; rising early and sending his messengers, for he spared his people, and his sanctuary.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  016" id="36  016" >16</span>
 Nevertheless they sneered at his messengers, and set at nothing his words, and mocked his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord rose up against his people, till there was no remedy.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  017" id="36  017" >17</span>
 And he brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, and killed their young men with the sword in the house of his sanctuary, and did not spare Sedekias, and had no mercy upon their virgins, and they led away their old men: he delivered all things into their hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  018" id="36  018" >18</span>
 And all the vessels of the house of God, the great and the small, and the treasures of the house of the Lord, and all the treasures of the king and the great men; he brought all to Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  019" id="36  019" >19</span>
 And he burnt the house of the Lord, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt its palaces with fire, and   utterly destroyed   every beautiful vessel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  020" id="36  020" >20</span>
 And he carried away the remnant to Babylon; and they were servants to him and to his sons until   the establishment of   the kingdom of the Medes.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  021" id="36  021" >21</span>
 That the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremias might be fulfilled, until the land should enjoy its sabbaths in resting   and   sabbath keeping all the days of its desolation, till the accomplishment of seventy years.  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  022" id="36  022" >22</span>
 In the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, after the fulfillment of the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremias, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of the Persians, and told him to make proclamation in writing throughout all his kingdom, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01436  023" id="36  023" >23</span>
 Thus says Cyrus king of the Persians to all the kingdoms of the earth, The Lord God of heaven has given me   power  , and he has commanded me to build a house to him in Jerusalem, in Judea. Who   is there   of you of all his people? His God shall be with him, and let him go up.
