<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">A</span>nd the word of the Lord came to Michaeas the son of Morasthi, in the days of Joatham, and Achaz, and Ezekias, kings of Juda, concerning what he saw regarding Samaria and Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0331  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 Hear   these   words, you° people; and let the earth give heed, and all that are in it: and the Lord God shall be among you for a testimony, the Lord out of his holy habitation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0331  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 For, behold, the Lord comes forth out of his place, and will come down, and will go upon the high places of the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0331  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And the mountains shall be shaken under him, and the valleys shall melt like wax before the fire, and as water rushing down a declivity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0331  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 All these   calamities are   for the transgression of Jacob, and for the sin of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob?   is it   not Samaria? and what is the sin of the house of Juda?   is it   not Jerusalem?  <span class="verse" rel="v0331  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 Therefore I will make Samaria   as   a store-house of the fruits of the field, and   as   a planting of a vineyard: and I will utterly demolish her stones, and I will expose her foundations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0331  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 And they shall cut in pieces all the graven images, and all that she has hired they shall burn with fire, and I will utterly destroy all her idols: because she has gathered of the hires of fornication, and of the hires of fornication has she amassed   wealth  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0331  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 Therefore shall she lament and wail, she shall go barefooted, and   being   naked she shall make lamentation as   that   of serpents, and mourning as of the daughters of sirens.  <span class="verse" rel="v0331  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 For her plague has become grievous; for it has come even to Juda; and has reached to the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0331  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 You° that are in Geth, exalt not yourselves, and you° Enakim, do not rebuild from   the ruins of   the house in derision: sprinkle dust   in the place of   your laughter.  <span class="verse" rel="v0331  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 The inhabitant of Sennaar, fairly inhabiting her cities, came not forth to mourn for the house next to her: she shall receive of you the stroke of grief.  <span class="verse" rel="v0331  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 Who has begun   to act   for good to her that dwells in sorrow? for calamities have come down from the Lord upon the gates of Jerusalem,  <span class="verse" rel="v0331  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
    even   a sound of chariots and horsemen: the inhabitants of Lachis, she is the leader of sin to the daughter of Sion: for in you were found the transgressions of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0331  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 Therefore shall he cause men to be sent forth as far as the inheritance of Geth,   even   vain houses; they are become vanity to the kings of Israel;  <span class="verse" rel="v0331  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 until they bring the heirs, O inhabitant of Lachis: the inheritance shall reach to Odollam,   even   the glory of the daughter of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0331  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 Shave your hair, and make yourself bald for your delicate children; increase your widowhood as an eagle; for   your people   are gone into captivity from you.  
<!-- 2   016 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> They meditated troubles, and wrought wickedness on their beds, and they put it in execution with the daylight; for they have not lifted up their hands to God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0332  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 And they desired fields, and plundered orphans, and oppressed families, and spoiled a man and his house, even a man and his inheritance.  <span class="verse" rel="v0332  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord; Behold, I devise evils against this family, out of which you° shall not lift up your necks, neither shall you° walk upright speedily: for the time is evil.  <span class="verse" rel="v0332  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 In that day shall a parable be taken up against you, and a plaintive lamentation shall be uttered, saying, We are thoroughly miserable: the portion of my people has been measured out with a line, and there was none to hinder him so as to turn him back; your fields have been divided.  <span class="verse" rel="v0332  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 Therefore you shall have no one to cast a line for the lot.  <span class="verse" rel="v0332  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 Weep not with tears in the assembly of the Lord, neither let   any   weep for these things; for he shall not remove the reproaches,  <span class="verse" rel="v0332  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 who says, The house of Jacob has provoked the Spirit of the Lord; are not these his practices? Are not the Lord's words right with him? and have they not proceeded correctly?  <span class="verse" rel="v0332  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 Even beforetime my people withstood   him   as an enemy against his peace; they have stripped off his skin to remove hope   in   the conflict of war.  <span class="verse" rel="v0332  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 The leaders of my people shall be cast forth from their luxurious houses; they are rejected because of their evil practices; draw you° near to the everlasting mountains.  <span class="verse" rel="v0332  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 Arise you, and depart; for this is not your rest because of uncleanness: you° have been utterly destroyed;  <span class="verse" rel="v0332  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 you° have fled, no one pursuing   you: your   spirit has framed falsehood, it has dropped on you for wine and strong drink. But it shall come to pass,   that   out of the dropping of this people,  <span class="verse" rel="v0332  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 Jacob shall be completely gathered with all   his people:   I will surely receive the remnant of Israel; I will cause them to return together, as sheep in trouble, as a flock in the midst of their fold: they shall rush forth from among men through the breach made before them:  <span class="verse" rel="v0332  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 they have broken through, and passed the gate, and gone out by it: and their king has gone out before them, and the Lord shall lead them.  
<!-- 3   013 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> And he shall say, Hear now these words, you° heads of the house of Jacob, and you° remnant of the house of Israel; is it not for you to know judgment?  <span class="verse" rel="v0333  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
    who   hate good, and seek evil;   who   tear their skins off them, and their flesh off their bones:  <span class="verse" rel="v0333  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 even as they devoured the flesh of my people, and stripped their skins off them, and broke their bones, and divided   them   as flesh for the caldron, and as meat for the pot,  <span class="verse" rel="v0333  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 thus they shall cry to the Lord, but he shall not listen to them; and he shall turn away his face from them at that time, because they have done wickedly in their practices against themselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v0333  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 Thus says the Lord concerning the prophets that lead my people astray, that bit with their teeth, and proclaim peace to them; and   when   nothing was put into their mouth, they raised up war against them:  <span class="verse" rel="v0333  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 therefore there shall be night to you instead of a vision, and there shall be to you darkness instead of prophecy; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be dark upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0333  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 And the seers of night-visions shall be ashamed, and the prophets shall be laughed to scorn: and all the people shall speak against them, because there shall be none to listen to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0333  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 Surely I will strengthen myself with the Spirit of the Lord, and of judgment, and of power, to declare to Jacob his transgressions, and to Israel his sins.  <span class="verse" rel="v0333  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 Hear now these words, you° chiefs of the house of Jacob, and the remnant of the house of Israel, who hate judgment, and pervert all righteousness;  <span class="verse" rel="v0333  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 who build up Sion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0333  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 The heads thereof have judged for gifts, and the priests thereof have answered for hire, and her prophets have divined for silver: and   yet   they have rested on the Lord, saying, Is not the Lord among us? no evil shall come upon us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0333  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 Therefore on your account Sion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall be as a storehouse of fruits, and the mountain of the house as a grove of the forest.  
<!-- 4   012 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> And at the last days the mountain of the Lord shall be manifest, established on the tops of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and the peoples shall hasten to it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0334  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 And many nations shall go, and say, Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and they shall show us his way, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Sion shall go forth a law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0334  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 And he shall judge among many peoples, and shall rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into sickles; and nation shall no more lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn to war any more.  <span class="verse" rel="v0334  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 And every one shall rest under his vine, and every one under his fig tree; and there shall be none to alarm   them  : for the mouth of the Lord Almighty has spoken these   words  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0334  005" id="4  005" >5</span>
 For all   other   nations shall walk everyone in his own way, but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0334  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 In that day, says the Lord, I will gather her that is bruised, and will receive her that is cast out, and those whom I rejected.  <span class="verse" rel="v0334  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 And I will make her that was bruised a remnant, and her that was rejected a mighty nation: and the Lord shall reign over them in mount Sion from henceforth, even for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0334  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 And you, dark tower of the flock, daughter of Sion, on you the dominion shall come and enter in,   even   the first kingdom from Babylon to the daughter of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0334  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 And now, why have you known calamities? was there not a king to you? or has your counsel perished that pangs as of a woman in travail have seized upon you?  <span class="verse" rel="v0334  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 Be in pain, and strengthen yourself, and draw near, O daughter of Sion, as a woman in travail: for now you shall go forth out of the city, and shall lodge in the plain, and shall reach even to Babylon: thence shall the Lord your God deliver you, and thence shall he redeem you out of the hand of your enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0334  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 And now have many nations gathered against you, saying, We will rejoice, and our eyes shall look upon Sion.  <span class="verse" rel="v0334  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 But they know not the thought of the Lord, and have not understood his counsel: for he has gathered them as sheaves of the floor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0334  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 Arise, and thresh them, O daughter of Sion: for I will make your horns iron, and I will make your hoofs brass: and you shall utterly destroy many nations, and shall consecrate their abundance to the Lord, and their strength to the Lord of all the earth.

<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> Now shall the daughter   of Sion   be completely hedged in: he has laid siege against us: they shall strike the tribes of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.  <span class="verse" rel="v0335  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 And you, Bethleem, house of Ephratha, are few in number to be   reckoned   among the thousands of Juda;   yet   out of you shall one come forth to me, to be a ruler of Israel; and his goings forth were from the beginning,   even   from eternity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0335  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 Therefore shall he appoint them   to wait   till the time of her that travails: she shall bring forth, and   then   the remnant of their brethren shall return to the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0335  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 And the Lord shall stand, and see, and feed his flock with power, and they shall dwell in the glory of the name of the Lord their God: for now shall they be magnified to the ends of the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0335  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 And she shall have peace when Assur shall come into your land, and when he shall come up upon your country; and there shall be raised up against him seven shepherds, and eight attacks of men.  <span class="verse" rel="v0335  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 And they shall tend the Assyrian with a sword, and the land of Nebrod with her trench: and he shall deliver   you   from the Assyrian, when he shall come upon your land, and when he shall invade your coasts.  <span class="verse" rel="v0335  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many peoples, as dew falling from the Lord, and as lambs on the grass; that none may assemble nor resist among the sons of men.  <span class="verse" rel="v0335  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many nations, as a lion in the forest among cattle, and as a   lion's   whelp among the flocks of sheep, even as when he goes through, and selects, and carries off   his prey  , and there is none to deliver.  <span class="verse" rel="v0335  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 Your hand shall be lifted up against them that afflict you, and all your enemies shall be utterly destroyed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0335  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 And it shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord,   that   I will utterly destroy the horses out of the midst of you, and destroy your chariots;  <span class="verse" rel="v0335  011" id="5  011" >11</span>
 and I will utterly destroy the cities of your land, and demolish all your strongholds:  <span class="verse" rel="v0335  012" id="5  012" >12</span>
 and I will utterly destroy your sorceries out of your hands; and there shall be no soothsayers in you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0335  013" id="5  013" >13</span>
 And I will utterly destroy your graven images, and your statues out of the midst of you; and you shall never any more worship the works of your hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v0335  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 And I will cut off the groves out of the midst of you, and I will abolish your cities.  <span class="verse" rel="v0335  015" id="5  015" >15</span>

 Hear you°, O mountains, the controversy of the Lord, and   you°   valleys   even   the foundations of the earth: for the Lord   has   a controversy with his people, and will plead with Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0336  003" id="6  003" >3</span>
 O my people, what have I done to you? or wherein have I grieved you? or wherein have I troubled you? answer me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0336  004" id="6  004" >4</span>
 For I brought tee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, and sent before you Moses, and Aaron, and Mariam.  <span class="verse" rel="v0336  005" id="6  005" >5</span>
 O my people, remember now, what counsel Balac king of Moab took against you, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, from the reeds to Galgal; that the righteousness of the Lord might be known.  <span class="verse" rel="v0336  006" id="6  006" >6</span>
 Wherewithal shall I reach the Lord,   and   lay hold of my God most high? shall I reach him by whole burnt offerings, by calves of a year old?  <span class="verse" rel="v0336  007" id="6  007" >7</span>
 Will the Lord accept thousands of rams, or ten thousands of fat goats? should I give my firstborn for ungodliness, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?  <span class="verse" rel="v0336  008" id="6  008" >8</span>
 Has it   not   been told you, O man, what   is   good? or what does the Lord require of you, but to do justice, and love mercy, and be ready to walk with the Lord your God?  <span class="verse" rel="v0336  009" id="6  009" >9</span>
 The Lord's voice shall be proclaimed in the city, and he shall save those that fear his name: hear, O tribe; and who shall order the city?  <span class="verse" rel="v0336  010" id="6  010" >10</span>
    Is there   not fire, and the house of the wicked heaping up wicked treasures, and   that   with the pride of unrighteousness?  <span class="verse" rel="v0336  011" id="6  011" >11</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="7  001">7  </span> Alas for me! for I am become as one gathering straw in harvest, and as   one gathering   grape-gleanings in the vintage, when there is no cluster for me to eat the first-ripe fruit: alas my soul!  <span class="verse" rel="v0337  002" id="7  002" >2</span>
 For the godly is perished from the earth; and there is none among men that orders   his way   aright: they all quarrel even to blood: they grievously afflict every one his neighbor:  <span class="verse" rel="v0337  003" id="7  003" >3</span>
 they prepare their hands for mischief, the prince asks   a reward  , and the judge speaks flattering words; it is the desire of their soul:  <span class="verse" rel="v0337  004" id="7  004" >4</span>
 therefore I will take away their goods as a devouring moth, and as one who acts by a   rigid   rule in a day of visitation. Woe, woe, your times of vengeance are come; now shall be their lamentations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0337  005" id="7  005" >5</span>

 Rejoice not against me, my enemy; for I have fallen   yet   shall arise; for though I should sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0337  009" id="7  009" >9</span>
 I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him, until he make good my cause: he also shall maintain my right, and shall bring me out to the light,   and   I shall behold his righteousness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0337  010" id="7  010" >10</span>
 And she that is my enemy shall see it, and shall clothe herself with shame, who says, Where   is   the Lord your God? my eyes shall look upon her: now shall she be for trampling as mire in the ways.  <span class="verse" rel="v0337  011" id="7  011" >11</span>

 And your cities shall be levelled, and parted among the Assyrians; and your strong cities shall be parted from Tyre to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0337  013" id="7  013" >13</span>

 Tend your people with your rod, the sheep of your inheritance, those that inhabit by themselves the thicket in the midst of Carmel: they shall feed in the land of Basan, and in the land of Galaad, as in the days of old.  <span class="verse" rel="v0337  015" id="7  015" >15</span>
 And according to the days of your departure out of Egypt shall you° see marvelous   things  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0337  016" id="7  016" >16</span>
