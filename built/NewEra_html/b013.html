<p><span class="chapter" id="10  001">10  </span> Now the Philistines warred against Israel; and they fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gelbue.  <span class="verse" rel="v01310  002" id="10  002" >2</span>
 And the Philistines pursued after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines struck Jonathan, and Aminadab, and Melchisue, sons of Saul.  <span class="verse" rel="v01310  003" id="10  003" >3</span>
 And the battle prevailed against Saul, and the archers hit him with bows and arrows, and they were wounded of the bows.  <span class="verse" rel="v01310  004" id="10  004" >4</span>
 And Saul said to his armor-bearer, Draw your sword, and pierce me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and mock me. But his armor-bearer would not, for he was greatly afraid: so Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01310  005" id="10  005" >5</span>
 And his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, and he also fell upon his sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v01310  006" id="10  006" >6</span>
 So Saul died, and his three sons on that day, and all his family died at the same time.  <span class="verse" rel="v01310  007" id="10  007" >7</span>
 And all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, and they left their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and lived in them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01310  008" id="10  008" >8</span>
 And it came to pass on the next   day   that the Philistines came to strip the slain, and they found Saul and his sons fallen on mount Gelbue.  <span class="verse" rel="v01310  009" id="10  009" >9</span>
 And they stripped him, and took his head, and his armor, and sent them into the land of the Philistines round about, to proclaim the glad tidings to their idols, and to the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01310  010" id="10  010" >10</span>
 And they put their armor in the house of their god, and they put his head in the house of Dagon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01310  011" id="10  011" >11</span>
 And all the dwellers in Galaad heard of all that the Philistines had done to Saul and to Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01310  012" id="10  012" >12</span>
 And all the mighty men rose up from Galaad, and they took the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabis, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabis, and fasted seven days.  <span class="verse" rel="v01310  013" id="10  013" >13</span>
 So Saul died for his transgressions, wherein he transgressed against God, against the word of the Lord, forasmuch as he kept   it   not, because Saul enquired of a wizard to seek   counsel  , and Samuel the prophet answered him:  <span class="verse" rel="v01310  014" id="10  014" >14</span>
 and he sought not the Lord: so he killed him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.

<p><span class="chapter" id="11  001">11  </span> And all Israel came to David in Chebron, saying, Behold, we   are   your bones and your flesh.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  002" id="11  002" >2</span>
 And heretofore when Saul was king, you were he that led Israel in and out, and the Lord of Israel said to you, You shall feed my people Israel, and you shall be for a ruler over Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  003" id="11  003" >3</span>
 And all the elders of Israel came to the king to Chebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Chebron before the Lord: and they anointed David to be king over Israel, according to the word of the Lord by Samuel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  004" id="11  004" >4</span>
 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem, this   is   Jebus; and there the Jebusites the inhabitants of the land said to David,  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  005" id="11  005" >5</span>
 You shall not enter in hither. But he took the strong hold of Sion: this   is   the city of David.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  006" id="11  006" >6</span>
 And David said, Whoever first smites the Jebusite, even he shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Saruia went up first, and became chief.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  007" id="11  007" >7</span>
 And David lived in the strong hold; therefore he called it the city of David.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  008" id="11  008" >8</span>
 And he fortified the city round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  009" id="11  009" >9</span>
 And David continued to increase, and the Lord Almighty   was   with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  010" id="11  010" >10</span>
 And these   are   the chiefs of the mighty men, whom David had, who strengthened   themselves   with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  011" id="11  011" >11</span>
 And this   is   the list of the mighty   men   of David; Jesebada, son of Achaman, first of the thirty: he drew his sword once against three hundred whom he killed at one time.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  012" id="11  012" >12</span>
 And after him Eleazar son of Dodai, the Achochite: he was among the three mighty men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  013" id="11  013" >13</span>
 He was with David in Phasodamin, and the Philistines were gathered there to battle, and   there was   a portion of the field full of barley; and the people fled before the Philistines.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  014" id="11  014" >14</span>
 And he stood in the midst of the portion, and rescued it, and struck the Philistines; and the Lord wrought a great deliverance.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  015" id="11  015" >15</span>
 And three of the thirty chiefs went down to the rock to David, to the cave of Odollam, and the camp of the Philistines   was   in the giants' valley.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  016" id="11  016" >16</span>
 And David   was   then in the hold, and the garrison of the Philistines   was   then in Bethleem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  017" id="11  017" >17</span>
 And David longed, and said, Who will give me water to drink of the well of Bethleem, that is in the gate?  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  018" id="11  018" >18</span>
 And the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, and they drew water out of the well that was in Bethleem, which was in the gate, and they took it, and came to David: but David would not drink it, and poured it out to the Lord, and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  019" id="11  019" >19</span>
 God forbid that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men with their lives? for with   the peril of   their lives they brought it. So he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty   men  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  020" id="11  020" >20</span>
 And Abisa the brother of Joab, he was chief of three: he drew his sword against three hundred slain at one time, and he had a name among the   second   three.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  021" id="11  021" >21</span>
 He was more famous than the two   others   of the three, and he was chief   over   them; yet he reached not to the   first   three.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  022" id="11  022" >22</span>
 And Banaia the son of Jodae was the son of a mighty man: many   were   his acts for Cabasael: he struck two lion-like men of Moab, and he went down and struck a lion in a pit on a snowy day.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  023" id="11  023" >23</span>
 And he struck an Egyptian, a wonderful man five cubits   high  ; and in the hand of the Egyptian   there was   a spear like a weavers' beam; and Banaia went down to him with a staff, and took the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  024" id="11  024" >24</span>
 These things did Banaia son of Jodae, and his name   was   among the three mighties.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  025" id="11  025" >25</span>
 He was distinguished beyond the thirty, yet he reached not to the   first   three: and David set him over his family.  <span class="verse" rel="v01311  026" id="11  026" >26</span>

 And there came   some   of the sons of Benjamin and Juda to the assistance of David.  <span class="verse" rel="v01312  017" id="12  017" >17</span>

 And   some   came to David from Manasse, when the Philistines came against Saul to war: and he helped them not, because the captains of the Philistines took counsel, saying, With the heads of those men will he return to his master Saul.  <span class="verse" rel="v01312  020" id="12  020" >20</span>
 When David was going to Sikelag, there came to him of Manasse, Edna and Jozabath, and Rodiel, and Michael, and Josabaith, and Elimuth, and Semathi:   these   are the captains of thousands of Manasse.  <span class="verse" rel="v01312  021" id="12  021" >21</span>
 And they fought on the side of David against a troop, for they   were   all men of might; and they were commanders in the army,   because   of   their   might.  <span class="verse" rel="v01312  022" id="12  022" >22</span>
 For daily men came to David,   till they amounted   to a great force, as the force of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01312  023" id="12  023" >23</span>
 And these   are   the names of the commanders of the army, who came to David to Chebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him according to the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01312  024" id="12  024" >24</span>

 All these   were   men of war, setting   the army   in battle array, with a peaceful mind   towards him  , and they came to Chebron to make David king over all Israel: and the rest of Israel   were of   one mind to make David king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01312  039" id="12  039" >39</span>
 And they were there three days eating and drinking, for their brethren   had   made preparations.  <span class="verse" rel="v01312  040" id="12  040" >40</span>
 And their neighbors, as far as Issachar and Zabulon and Nephthali, brought to them upon camels, and asses, and mules, and upon calves, food, meal, cakes of figs, raisins, wine, and oil, calves and sheep abundantly: for   there was   joy in Israel.

<p><span class="chapter" id="13  001">13  </span> And David took counsel with the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,   even with   every commander.  <span class="verse" rel="v01313  002" id="13  002" >2</span>
 And David said to the whole congregation of Israel, If it   seem   good to you, and it should be prospered by the Lord our God, let us send to our brethren that are left in all the land of Israel, and let the priests the Levites who are with them in the cities of their possession   come  , and let them be gathered to us.  <span class="verse" rel="v01313  003" id="13  003" >3</span>
 And let us bring over to us the ark of our God; for men have not enquired   at   it since the days of Saul.  <span class="verse" rel="v01313  004" id="13  004" >4</span>
 And all the congregation said that they would do thus; for the saying was right in the eyes of all the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01313  005" id="13  005" >5</span>
 So David assembled all Israel, from the borders of Egypt even to the entering in of Hemath, to bring in the ark of God from the city of Jarim.  <span class="verse" rel="v01313  006" id="13  006" >6</span>
 And David brought it up: and all Israel went up to the city of David, which belonged to Juda, to bring up thence the ark of the Lord God who sits between the cherubim, whose name is called   on it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01313  007" id="13  007" >7</span>
 And they set the ark of God on a new waggon   brought   out of the house of Aminadab: and Oza and his brethren drove the waggon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01313  008" id="13  008" >8</span>
 And David and all Israel   were   playing before the Lord with all their might, and   that   together with singers, and with harps, and with lutes, with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.  <span class="verse" rel="v01313  009" id="13  009" >9</span>
 And they came as far as the threshing floor: and Oza put forth his hand to hold the ark, because the bullock moved it from   its place  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01313  010" id="13  010" >10</span>
 And the Lord was very angry with Oza, and struck him there, because of his stretching forth his hand upon the ark: and he died there before God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01313  011" id="13  011" >11</span>
 And David was dispirited, because the Lord   had   made a breach on Oza: and he called that place the Breach of Oza until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v01313  012" id="13  012" >12</span>
 And David feared God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God in to myself?  <span class="verse" rel="v01313  013" id="13  013" >13</span>
 So David brought not the ark home to himself into the city of David, but he turned it aside into the house of Abeddara the Gethite.  <span class="verse" rel="v01313  014" id="13  014" >14</span>
 And the ark of God abode in the house of Abeddara three months: and God blessed Abeddara and all that he had.

<p><span class="chapter" id="14  001">14  </span> And Chiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar timbers, and masons, and carpenters, to build a house for him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01314  002" id="14  002" >2</span>
 And David knew that the Lord   had   designed him to be king over Israel; because his kingdom was highly exalted, on account of his people Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01314  003" id="14  003" >3</span>
 And David took more wives in Jerusalem: and there were born to David more sons and daughters.  <span class="verse" rel="v01314  004" id="14  004" >4</span>
 And these   are   the names of those that were born, who were   born   to him in Jerusalem; Samaa, Sobab, Nathan, and Solomon,  <span class="verse" rel="v01314  005" id="14  005" >5</span>

 And the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel: and all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard   it  , and went out to meet them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01314  009" id="14  009" >9</span>
 And the Philistines came and assembled together in the giants' valley.  <span class="verse" rel="v01314  010" id="14  010" >10</span>
 And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and will you deliver them into my hand? And the Lord said to him, Go up, and I will deliver them into your hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v01314  011" id="14  011" >11</span>
 And he went up to Baal Pharasin, and David struck them there; and David said, God has broken through enemies by my hand like a breach of water: therefore he called the name of that place, the Breach of Pharasin.  <span class="verse" rel="v01314  012" id="14  012" >12</span>
 And the Philistines left their gods there; and David gave orders to burn them with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v01314  013" id="14  013" >13</span>
 And the Philistines once more assembled themselves in the giants' valley.  <span class="verse" rel="v01314  014" id="14  014" >14</span>
 And David enquired of God again; and God said to him, You shall not go after them; turn away from them, and you shall come upon them near the pear trees.  <span class="verse" rel="v01314  015" id="14  015" >15</span>
 And it shall be, when you shall hear the sound of their tumult in the tops of the pear trees, then you shall go into the battle: for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" rel="v01314  016" id="14  016" >16</span>
 And he did as God commanded him: and he struck the army of the Philistines from Gabaon to Gazera.  <span class="verse" rel="v01314  017" id="14  017" >17</span>
 And the name of David was   famous   in all the land; and the Lord put the terror of him on all the nations.

<p><span class="chapter" id="15  001">15  </span> And   David   made for himself houses in the city of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and made a tent for it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  002" id="15  002" >2</span>
 Then said David, It is not   lawful for any   to bear the ark of God, but the Levites; for the Lord has chosen them to bear the ark of the Lord, and to minister to him for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  003" id="15  003" >3</span>
 And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the Lord to the place which he   had   prepared for it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  004" id="15  004" >4</span>
 And David gathered together the sons of Aaron the Levites.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  005" id="15  005" >5</span>
 Of the sons of Caath;   there was   Uriel the chief, and his brethren, a hundred and twenty.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  006" id="15  006" >6</span>
 Of the sons of Merari; Asaia the chief, and his brethren, two hundred and twenty.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  007" id="15  007" >7</span>
 Of the sons of Gedson; Joel the chief, and his brethren, a hundred and thirty.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  008" id="15  008" >8</span>
 Of the sons of Elisaphat; Semei the chief, and his brethren, two hundred.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  009" id="15  009" >9</span>

 Of the sons of Oziel; Aminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  011" id="15  011" >11</span>
 And David called Sadoc and Abiathar the priests, and the Levites, Uriel, Asaia, and Joel, and Semaia, and Eliel, and Aminadab,  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  012" id="15  012" >12</span>
 and said to them, YouÂ°   are   the heads of the families of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, you and your brethren, and youÂ° shall carry up the ark of the God of Israel,   to the place   which I have prepared for it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  013" id="15  013" >13</span>
 For because youÂ° were not   ready   at the first, our God made a breach upon us, because we sought him not according to the ordinance.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  014" id="15  014" >14</span>
 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves, to bring up the ark of the God of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  015" id="15  015" >15</span>
 And the sons of the Levites took the ark of God, (as Moses commanded by the word of God according to the scripture) upon their shoulders with staves.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  016" id="15  016" >16</span>
 And David said to the chiefs of the Levites, Set your brethren the singers with musical instruments, lutes, harps, and cymbals, to sound aloud with a voice of joy.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  017" id="15  017" >17</span>
 So the Levites appointed Aeman the son of Joel; Asaph the son of Barachias   was one   of his brethren; and Aethan the son of Kisaeus was of the sons of Merari their brethren;  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  018" id="15  018" >18</span>
 and with them their brethren of the second rank, Zacharias, and Oziel, and Semiramoth, and Jeiel, and Elioel, and Eliab, and Banaia, and Maasaia, and Matthathia, and Eliphena, and Makellia, and Abdedom, and Jeiel, and Ozias, the porters.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  019" id="15  019" >19</span>
 And the singers, Aeman, Asaph, and Aethan, with brazen cymbals to make   a sound   to be heard.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  020" id="15  020" >20</span>
 Zacharias, and Oziel, Semiramoth, Jeiel, Oni, Eliab, Maasaeas, Banaeas, with lutes, on alaemoth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  021" id="15  021" >21</span>
 And Mattathias, and Eliphalu, and Makenia, and Abdedom, and Jeiel, and Ozias, with harps of Amasenith, to make a loud noise.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  022" id="15  022" >22</span>
 And Chonenia chief of the Levites   was   master of the bands, because he was skillful.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  023" id="15  023" >23</span>
 And Barachia and Elcana   were   doorkeepers of the ark.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  024" id="15  024" >24</span>
 And Somnia, and Josaphat, and Nathanael, and Amasai, and Zacharia, and Banaea, and Eliezer, the priests, were sounding with trumpets before the ark of God: and Abdedom and Jeia   were   doorkeepers of the ark of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  025" id="15  025" >25</span>
 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains of thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant from the house of Abdedom with gladness.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  026" id="15  026" >26</span>
 And it came to pass when God strengthened the Levites bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord, that they sacrificed seven calves and seven rams.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  027" id="15  027" >27</span>
 And David   was   girded with a fine linen robe, and all the Levites   who were   bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the singers, and Chonenias the master of the band of singers; also upon David   there was   a robe of fine linen.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  028" id="15  028" >28</span>
 And all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting, and with the sound of a horn, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, playing loudly on lutes and harps.  <span class="verse" rel="v01315  029" id="15  029" >29</span>
 And the ark of the covenant of the Lord arrived, and came to the city of David; and Melchol the daughter of Saul looked down through the window, and saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.  
<!-- 16   029 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="16  001">16  </span> So they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tabernacle which David pitched for it; and they offered whole burnt offerings and peace-offerings before God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  002" id="16  002" >2</span>
 And David finished offering up whole burnt offerings and peace-offerings, and blessed the people in the name of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  003" id="16  003" >3</span>
 And he divided to every man of Israel (both men and women), to   every   man one baker's loaf, and a cake.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  004" id="16  004" >4</span>
 And he appointed before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, Levites to minister   and   lift up the voice, and to give thanks and praise the Lord God of Israel:  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  005" id="16  005" >5</span>
 Asaph   was   the chief, and next to him Zacharias, Jeiel, Semiramoth, and Jeiel, Mattathias, Eliab, and Banaeas, and Abdedom: and Jeiel sounding with musical instruments, lutes   and   harps, and Asaph with cymbals:  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  006" id="16  006" >6</span>

 Song. Give thanks to the Lord, call upon him by his name, make known his designs among the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  009" id="16  009" >9</span>
 Sing   songs   to him, and sing hymns to him, relate to all   people   his wonderful deeds, which the Lord has wrought.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  010" id="16  010" >10</span>

 Remember his wonderful works which he has wrought, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  013" id="16  013" >13</span>
    youÂ°   seed of Israel his servants,   youÂ°   seed of Jacob his chosen ones.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  014" id="16  014" >14</span>
 He   is   the Lord our God; his judgments   are   in all the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  015" id="16  015" >15</span>
 Let us remember his covenant for ever, his word which he commanded to a thousand generations,  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  016" id="16  016" >16</span>
 which he covenanted with Abraham, and his oath   sworn   to Isaac.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  017" id="16  017" >17</span>
 He confirmed it to Jacob for an ordinance, to Israel   as   an everlasting covenant,  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  018" id="16  018" >18</span>
 saying, To you will I give the land of Chanaan, the line of your inheritance:  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  019" id="16  019" >19</span>
 when they were few in number, when they were but little, and lived as strangers in it;  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  020" id="16  020" >20</span>
 and went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  021" id="16  021" >21</span>
 He suffered not a man to oppress them, and he reproved kings for their sakes,  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  022" id="16  022" >22</span>
 saying, Touch not my anointed ones, and deal not wrongfully with my prophets.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  023" id="16  023" >23</span>
 Sing youÂ° to the Lord, all the earth; proclaim his salvation from day to day.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  024" id="16  024" >24</span>
 Declare among the nations his glory, his wondrous deeds among all peoples.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  025" id="16  025" >25</span>
 For the Lord   is   great, and greatly to be praised: he   is   to be feared above all gods.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  026" id="16  026" >26</span>
 For all the gods of the nations   are   idols; but our God made the heavens.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  027" id="16  027" >27</span>
 Glory and praise   are   in his presence; strength and rejoicing   are   in his place.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  028" id="16  028" >28</span>
 Give to the Lord, youÂ° families of the nations, give to the Lord glory and strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  029" id="16  029" >29</span>
 Give to the Lord the glory   belonging   to his name: take gifts and offer   them   before him; and worship the Lord in his holy courts.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  030" id="16  030" >30</span>
 Let the whole earth fear before him; let the earth be established, and not be moved.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  031" id="16  031" >31</span>
 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth exult; and let them say among the nations, The Lord reigns.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  032" id="16  032" >32</span>
 The sea with its fullness shall resound and the tree of the field, and all things in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  033" id="16  033" >33</span>
 Then shall the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord, for he is come to judge the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  034" id="16  034" >34</span>
 Give thanks to the Lord, for   it is   good, for his mercy   is   for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  035" id="16  035" >35</span>
 And say youÂ°, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us, and rescue us from among the heathen, that we may praise your holy name, and glory in your praises.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  036" id="16  036" >36</span>
 Blessed   be   the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and to everlasting: And all the people shall say, Amen. So they praised the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  037" id="16  037" >37</span>
 And they left there Asaph and his brethren before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to minister before the ark continually, according to the service of each day: from day to day.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  038" id="16  038" >38</span>
 And Abdedom and his brethren   were   sixty and eight; and Abdedom the son of Idithun, and Osa,   were   to be doorkeepers.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  039" id="16  039" >39</span>
 And   they appointed   Sadoc the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the Lord in the high place in Gabaon,  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  040" id="16  040" >40</span>
 to offer up whole burnt offerings continually morning and evening, and according to all things written in the law of the Lord, which he commanded the children of Israel by Moses the servant of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  041" id="16  041" >41</span>
 And with him   were   Aeman and Idithun, and the rest chosen out by name to praise the Lord, for his mercy   endures   for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  042" id="16  042" >42</span>
 And with them   there were   trumpets and cymbals to sound aloud, and musical instruments for the songs of God: and the sons of Idithun   were   at the gate.  <span class="verse" rel="v01316  043" id="16  043" >43</span>
 And all the people went every one to his home: and David returned to bless his house.

<p><span class="chapter" id="17  001">17  </span> And it came to pass as David lived in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the Lord   is   under   curtains   of skins.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  002" id="17  002" >2</span>
 And Nathan said to David, Do all that is in your heart; for God   is   with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  003" id="17  003" >3</span>
 And it came to pass in that night, that the word of the Lord came to Nathan,   saying  ,  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  004" id="17  004" >4</span>
 Go and say to David my servant, Thus said the Lord, You shall not build me a house for me to dwell in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  005" id="17  005" >5</span>
 For I have not lived in a house from the day that I brought up Israel until this day, but I have been in a tabernacle and a tent,  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  006" id="17  006" >6</span>
 in all places through which I have gone with all Israel: did I ever speak to   any   one tribe of Israel whom I commanded to feed my people, saying,   Why is it   that youÂ° have not built me a house of cedar?  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  007" id="17  007" >7</span>
 And now thus shall you say to my servant David, Thus says the Lord Almighty, I took you from the sheepfold, from following the flocks, to be a ruler over my people Israel:  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  008" id="17  008" >8</span>
 and I was with you in all places whither you went, and I destroyed all your enemies from before you, and I made for you a name according to the name of the great ones that are upon the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  009" id="17  009" >9</span>
 And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and I will plant him, and he shall dwell by himself, and shall no longer be anxious; and the son of iniquity shall no longer afflict him, as at the beginning,  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  010" id="17  010" >10</span>
 and from the days when I appointed judges over my people Israel. Also I have humbled all your enemies, and I will increase you, and the Lord will build you a house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  011" id="17  011" >11</span>
 And it shall come to pass when your days shall be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, that I will raise up your seed after you, which shall be of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  012" id="17  012" >12</span>
 He shall build me a house, and I will set up his throne for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  013" id="17  013" >13</span>
 I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son: and my mercy will I not withdraw from him, as I withdrew   it   from them that were before you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  014" id="17  014" >14</span>
 And I will establish him in my house and in his kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be set up for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  015" id="17  015" >15</span>
 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so spoke Nathan to David.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  016" id="17  016" >16</span>
 And king David came and sat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord God? and what   is   my house, that you have loved me for ever?  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  017" id="17  017" >17</span>
 And these things were little in your sight, O God: you have also spoken concerning the house of your servant for a long time to come, and you have looked upon me as a man looks upon his fellow, and have exalted me, O Lord God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  018" id="17  018" >18</span>
 What shall David do more toward you to glorify   you  ? and you know your servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  019" id="17  019" >19</span>
 And you have wrought all this greatness according to your heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  020" id="17  020" >20</span>
 O Lord, there is none like you, and there is no God beside you, according to all things which we have heard with our ears.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  021" id="17  021" >21</span>
 Neither is there another nation upon the earth   such   as your people Israel, whereas God led him in the way, to redeem a people for himself, to make for himself a great and glorious name, to cast out nations from before your people, whom you redeemed out of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  022" id="17  022" >22</span>
 And you have appointed your people Israel as a people to yourself for ever; and you, Lord, did become a God to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  023" id="17  023" >23</span>
 And now, Lord, let the word which you spoke to your servant, and concerning his house, be confirmed for ever, and do you as you have spoken.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  024" id="17  024" >24</span>
 And let your name   be   established and magnified for ever,   men   saying, Lord, Lord, Almighty God of Israel: and   let   the house of your servant David   be   established before you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  025" id="17  025" >25</span>
 For you, O Lord my God, have revealed to the ear of your servant that you will build him a house; therefore your servant has found a willingness to pray before you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  026" id="17  026" >26</span>
 And now, Lord, you yourself are God, and you have spoken these good things concerning your servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v01317  027" id="17  027" >27</span>
 And now you have begun to bless the house of your servant, so that it should continue for ever before you: for you, Lord, have blessed   it  , and do you bless   it   for ever.

<p><span class="chapter" id="18  001">18  </span> And it came to pass afterwards, that David struck the Philistines, and routed them, and took Geth and its villages out of the hand of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" rel="v01318  002" id="18  002" >2</span>
 And he struck Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David,   and   tributaries.  <span class="verse" rel="v01318  003" id="18  003" >3</span>
 And David struck Adraazar king of Suba of Emath, as he was going to establish power toward the river Euphrates.  <span class="verse" rel="v01318  004" id="18  004" >4</span>
 And David took of them a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand infantry: and David houghed all the chariot   horses  , but there were reserved of them a hundred chariots.  <span class="verse" rel="v01318  005" id="18  005" >5</span>
 And the Syrian came from Damascus to help Adraazar king of Suba; and David struck of the Syrian   army   twenty and two thousand men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01318  006" id="18  006" >6</span>
 And David put a garrison in Syria near Damascus; and they became tributary servants to David: and the Lord delivered David wherever he went.  <span class="verse" rel="v01318  007" id="18  007" >7</span>
 And David took the golden collars that were on the servants of Adraazar, and brought them to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01318  008" id="18  008" >8</span>
 And David took out of Matabeth, and out of the chief cities of Adraazar very much brass: of this Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the brazen vessels.  <span class="verse" rel="v01318  009" id="18  009" >9</span>
 And Thoa king of Emath heard that David had struck the whole force of Adraazar king of Suba.  <span class="verse" rel="v01318  010" id="18  010" >10</span>
 And he sent Aduram his son to king David to ask how he was, and to congratulate him because he had fought against Adraazar, and struck him; for Thoa was the enemy of Adraazar.  <span class="verse" rel="v01318  011" id="18  011" >11</span>
 And all the golden and silver and brazen vessels, even these king David consecrated to the Lord, with the silver and the gold which he took from all the nations; from Idumaea, and Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalec.  <span class="verse" rel="v01318  012" id="18  012" >12</span>
 And Abesa son of Saruia struck the Idumeans in the valley of Salt, eighteen thousand.  <span class="verse" rel="v01318  013" id="18  013" >13</span>
 And he put garrisons in the valley; and all the Idumaeans became David's servants: and the Lord delivered David wherever he went.  <span class="verse" rel="v01318  014" id="18  014" >14</span>
 So David reigned over all Israel; and he executed judgment and justice to all his people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01318  015" id="18  015" >15</span>
 And Joab the son of Saruia   was   over the army, and Josaphat the son of Achilud   was   recorder.  <span class="verse" rel="v01318  016" id="18  016" >16</span>
 And Sadoc son of Achitob, and Achimelech son of Abiathar,   were   the priests; and Susa   was   the scribe;  <span class="verse" rel="v01318  017" id="18  017" >17</span>
 and Banaeas the son of Jodae   was   over the Cherethite and the Phelethite, and the sons of David were the chief deputies of the king.

<p><span class="chapter" id="19  001">19  </span> And it came to pass after this,   that   Naas the king of the children of Ammon died, and Anan his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01319  002" id="19  002" >2</span>
 And David said, I will act kindly toward Anan the son of Naas, as his father acted kindly towards me. And David sent messengers to condole with him on the death of his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Anan, to comfort him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01319  003" id="19  003" >3</span>
 And the chiefs of the children of Ammon said to Anan, Is it to honor your father before you, that David has sent comforters to you? Have not his servants come to you that they might search the city, and to spy out the land?  <span class="verse" rel="v01319  004" id="19  004" >4</span>
 And Anan took the servants of David, and shaved them, and cut off the half of their garments as far as their tunic, and sent them away.  <span class="verse" rel="v01319  005" id="19  005" >5</span>
 And there came men to report to David concerning the men: and he sent to meet them, for they were greatly disgraced: and the king said, Dwell in Jericho until your beards have grown, and return.  <span class="verse" rel="v01319  006" id="19  006" >6</span>
 And the children of Ammon saw that the people of David were ashamed, and Anan and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen out of Syria of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria Maacha, and from Sobal.  <span class="verse" rel="v01319  007" id="19  007" >7</span>
 And they hired for themselves two and thirty thousand chariots, and the king of Maacha and his people; and they came and encamped before Medaba: and the children of Ammon assembled out of their cities, and came to fight.  <span class="verse" rel="v01319  008" id="19  008" >8</span>
 And David heard, and sent Joab and all the host of mighty men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01319  009" id="19  009" >9</span>
 And the children of Ammon came forth, and set themselves in array for battle by the gate of the city: and the kings that were come forth encamped by themselves in the plain.  <span class="verse" rel="v01319  010" id="19  010" >10</span>
 And Joab saw that they were fronting   him   to fight against him before and behind, and he chose   some   out of all the young men of Israel, and they set themselves in array against the Syrian.  <span class="verse" rel="v01319  011" id="19  011" >11</span>
 And the rest of the people he gave into the hand of his brother Abesai, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01319  012" id="19  012" >12</span>
 And he said, If the Syrian should prevail against me, then shall you deliver me: and if the children of Ammon should prevail against you, then will I deliver you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01319  013" id="19  013" >13</span>
 Be of good courage, and let us be strong, for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the Lord shall do what   is   good in his eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v01319  014" id="19  014" >14</span>
 So Joab and the people that were with him set themselves in battle array against the Syrians, and they fled from them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01319  015" id="19  015" >15</span>
 And the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians fled, and they also fled from before Abesai, and from before Joab his brother, and they came to the city: and Joab came to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01319  016" id="19  016" >16</span>
 And the Syrian saw that Israel had defeated him, and he sent messengers, and they brought out the Syrians from beyond the river; and Sophath the commander-in-chief of the forces of Adraazar   was   before them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01319  017" id="19  017" >17</span>
 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and crossed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So David set   his army   in array to fight against the Syrians, and they fought against him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01319  018" id="19  018" >18</span>
 And the Syrians fled from before Israel; and David killed of the Syrians seven thousand   riders in   chariots, and forty thousand infantry, and he killed Sophath the commander-in-chief of the forces.  <span class="verse" rel="v01319  019" id="19  019" >19</span>
 And the servants of Adraazar saw that they were defeated before Israel, and they made peace with David and served him: and the Syrians would not any more help the children of Ammon.

<p><span class="chapter" id="20  001">20  </span> And it came to pass at the return of the year, at the   time of the   going forth of kings   to war  , that Joab gathered the whole force of the army, and they ravaged the land of the children of Ammon; and he came and besieged Rabba. But David abode in Jerusalem. And Joab struck Rabba and destroyed it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01320  002" id="20  002" >2</span>
 And David took the crown of Molchom their king off his head, and the weight of it was found   to be   a talent of gold, and on it were precious stones; and it was   placed   on the head of David: and he brought out the spoils of the city   which were   very great.  <span class="verse" rel="v01320  003" id="20  003" >3</span>
 And he brought out the people that were in it, and sawed them asunder with saws, and   cut them   with iron axes, and with harrows: and thus David did to all the children of Ammon. And David and all his people returned to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01320  004" id="20  004" >4</span>
 And it came to pass afterward that there was again war with the Philistines in Gazer: then Sobochai the Sosathite struck Saphut of the sons of the giants, and laid him low.  <span class="verse" rel="v01320  005" id="20  005" >5</span>
 And there   was   war again with the Philistines; and Eleanan the son of Jair struck Lachmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, and the wood of his spear   was   as a weavers' beam.  <span class="verse" rel="v01320  006" id="20  006" >6</span>
 And there was again war in Geth, and there was a man of extraordinary size, and his fingers   and toes were   six on each hand and foot, four and twenty; and he was descended from the giants.  <span class="verse" rel="v01320  007" id="20  007" >7</span>
 And he defied Israel, and Jonathan the son of Samaa the brother of David killed him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01320  008" id="20  008" >8</span>
 These were born to Rapha in Geth; all four were giants, and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

 And Joab gave the number of the mustering of the people to David: and all Israel was a million and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and the sons of Juda   were   four hundred and seventy thousand men that drew sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  006" id="21  006" >6</span>
 But he numbered not Levi and Benjamin among them; for the word of the king was painful to Joab.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  007" id="21  007" >7</span>
 And   there was   evil in the sight of the Lord respecting this thing; and he struck Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  008" id="21  008" >8</span>
 And David said to God, I have sinned exceedingly, in that I have done this thing: and now, I pray you, remove the sin of your servant; for I have been exceedingly foolish.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  009" id="21  009" >9</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Gad the seer, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  010" id="21  010" >10</span>
 Go and speak to David, saying, Thus says the Lord, I bring three things upon you: choose one of them for yourself, and I will do it to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  011" id="21  011" >11</span>
 And Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus says the Lord, Choose for yourself,  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  012" id="21  012" >12</span>
 either three years of famine, or that you should flee three months from the face of your enemies, and the sword of your enemies   shall be employed   to destroy you, or that the sword of the Lord and pestilence   should be   three days in the land, and the angel of the Lord   shall be   destroying in all the inheritance of Israel. And now consider what I shall answer to him that sent the message.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  013" id="21  013" >13</span>
 And David said to Gad, They are very hard for me, even   all   the three: let me fall now into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies   are   very abundant, and let me not fall by any means into the hands of man.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  014" id="21  014" >14</span>
 So the Lord brought pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  015" id="21  015" >15</span>
 And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the Lord saw, and repented for the evil, and said to the angel that was destroying, Let it suffice you; withhold your hand. And the angel of the Lord stood by the threshing floor of Orna the Jebusite.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  016" id="21  016" >16</span>
 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the Lord, standing between the earth and the heaven, and his sword drawn in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem: and David and the elders clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  017" id="21  017" >17</span>
 And David said to God,   Was it   not I   that   gave orders to number the people? and I am the guilty one; I have greatly sinned: but these sheep, what have they done? O Lord God, let your hand be upon me, and upon my father's house, and not on your people for destruction, O Lord!  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  018" id="21  018" >18</span>
 And the angel of the Lord told Gad to tell David, that he should go up to erect and altar to the Lord, in the threshing floor of Orna the Jebusite.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  019" id="21  019" >19</span>
 And David went up according to the word of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  020" id="21  020" >20</span>
 And Orna turned and saw the king; and he hid himself and his four sons with him. Now Orna was threshing wheat.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  021" id="21  021" >21</span>
 And David came to Orna; and Orna came forth from the threshing floor, and did obeisance to David with his face to the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  022" id="21  022" >22</span>
 And David said to Orna, Give me your place of the threshing floor, and I will build upon it an altar to the Lord: give it me for its worth in money, and the plague shall cease from   among   the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  023" id="21  023" >23</span>
 And Orna said to David, Take it to yourself, and let my lord the king do what is right in his eyes: see, I have given the calves for a whole burnt offering, and the plow for wood, and the corn for a meat-offering; I have given all.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  024" id="21  024" >24</span>
 And king David said to Orna, Nay; for I will surely buy it for its worth in money: for I will not take your property for the Lord, to offer a whole burnt offering to the Lord without cost   to myself  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  025" id="21  025" >25</span>
 And David gave to Orna for his place six hundred shekels of gold   by   weight.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  026" id="21  026" >26</span>
 And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered up whole burnt offerings and peace-offerings: and he cried to the Lord, and he answered him by fire out of heaven on the altar of whole burnt offerings, and   it   consumed the whole burnt offering.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  027" id="21  027" >27</span>
 And the Lord spoke to the angel; and he put up the sword into its sheath.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  028" id="21  028" >28</span>
 At that time when David saw that the Lord answered him in the threshing floor of Orna the Jebusite, he also sacrificed there.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  029" id="21  029" >29</span>
 And the tabernacle of the Lord which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of whole burnt offerings,   were   at that time in the high place at Gabaon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01321  030" id="21  030" >30</span>
 And David could not go before it to enquire of God; for he hasted not because of the sword of the angel of the Lord.  
<!-- 22   030 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="22  001">22  </span> And David said, This is the house of the Lord God, and this   is   the altar for whole burnt offering for Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01322  002" id="22  002" >2</span>
 And David gave orders to gather all the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he appointed stone-hewers to hew polished stones to build the house to God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01322  003" id="22  003" >3</span>
 And David prepared much iron for the nails of the doors and the gate; the hinges also and brass in abundance, there was no weighing   of it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01322  004" id="22  004" >4</span>
 And cedar threes without number: for the Sidonians and the Tyrians brought cedar trees in abundance to David.  <span class="verse" rel="v01322  005" id="22  005" >5</span>
 And David said, My son Solomon   is   a tender child, and the house   for me   to build to the Lord   is   for superior magnificence for a name and for a glory through all the earth: I will make preparation for it. And David prepared abundantly before his death.  <span class="verse" rel="v01322  006" id="22  006" >6</span>
 And he called Solomon his son, and commanded him to build the house for the Lord God of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01322  007" id="22  007" >7</span>
 And David said to Solomon,   My   child, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of the Lord God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01322  008" id="22  008" >8</span>
 But the word of the Lord came to me, saying, You have shed blood abundantly, and have carried on great wars: you shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood upon the earth before me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01322  009" id="22  009" >9</span>
 Behold, a son shall be born to you, he shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name   shall be   Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.  <span class="verse" rel="v01322  010" id="22  010" >10</span>
 He shall build a house to my name; and he shall be a son to me, and I will be a father to him; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom in Israel for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v01322  011" id="22  011" >11</span>
 And now, my son, the Lord shall be with you, and prosper   you  ; and you shall build a house to the Lord your God, as he spoke concerning you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01322  012" id="22  012" >12</span>
 Only may the Lord give you wisdom and prudence, and strengthen you over Israel, both to keep and to do the law of the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01322  013" id="22  013" >13</span>
 Then will he prosper   you  , if you take heed to do the commandments and judgments which the Lord commanded Moses for Israel: be courageous and strong; fear not, nor be terrified.  <span class="verse" rel="v01322  014" id="22  014" >14</span>
 And, behold, I according to my poverty have prepared for the house of the Lord a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a million talents of silver, and brass and iron without measure; for it is abundant; and I have prepared timber and stones; and do you add to these.  <span class="verse" rel="v01322  015" id="22  015" >15</span>
 And   of them that are   with you do you add to the multitude of workmen;   let there be   artificers and masons, and carpenters, and every skillful   workman   in every work;  <span class="verse" rel="v01322  016" id="22  016" >16</span>

 And David charged all the chief men of Israel to help Solomon his son,   saying  ,  <span class="verse" rel="v01322  018" id="22  018" >18</span>
    Is   not the Lord with you? and he has given you rest round about, for he has given into your hands the inhabitants of the land; and the land is subdued before the Lord, and before his people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01322  019" id="22  019" >19</span>
 Now set your hearts and souls to seek after the Lord your God: and rise, and build a sanctuary to your God to carry in the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the Lord.

<p><span class="chapter" id="23  001">23  </span> And David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel in his stead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01323  002" id="23  002" >2</span>
 And he assembled all the chief men of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites.  <span class="verse" rel="v01323  003" id="23  003" >3</span>
 And the Levites numbered   themselves   from thirty years old and upward; and their number by their polls amounted to thirty and eight thousand men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01323  004" id="23  004" >4</span>
 Of the overseers over the works of the house of the Lord   there were   twenty-four thousand, and   there were   six thousand scribes and judges;  <span class="verse" rel="v01323  005" id="23  005" >5</span>

 And the Levites bore not the tabernacle, and all the vessels of it for its service.  <span class="verse" rel="v01323  027" id="23  027" >27</span>

 For he appointed them to wait on Aaron, to minister in the house of the Lord, over the courts, and over the chambers, and over the purification of all the holy things, and over the works of the service of the house of God;  <span class="verse" rel="v01323  029" id="23  029" >29</span>

 He gave him likewise the weight of the tables of show bread, of each table of gold, and likewise of the   tables of   silver:  <span class="verse" rel="v01328  017" id="28  017" >17</span>
 also of the flesh hooks, and vessels for drink-offering, and golden bowls: and the weight of the gold and silver   articles  , and censers,   and   bowls, according to the weight of each.  <span class="verse" rel="v01328  018" id="28  018" >18</span>
 And he showed him the weight   of the utensils   of the altar of incense,   which was   of pure gold, and the plan of the chariot of the cherubs that spread out their wings, and overshadowed the ark of the covenant of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01328  019" id="28  019" >19</span>

And behold the pattern of the temple, even his house, and its treasury, and the upper chambers, and the inner store-rooms, and the place of propitiation, and the plan of the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01328  021" id="28  021" >21</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="29  001">29  </span> And David the king said to all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom the Lord has chosen,   is   young and tender, and the work   is   great; for   it is   not for man, but for the Lord God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  002" id="29  002" >2</span>
 I have prepared according to all   my   might for the house of my God gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, onyx stones, and costly and variegated stones for setting, and every precious stone, and much Parian   marble  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  003" id="29  003" >3</span>
 And still farther, because I took pleasure in the house of my God, I have gold and silver which I have procured for myself, and, behold, I have given them to the house of my God over and above, beyond what I have prepared for the holy house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  004" id="29  004" >4</span>
 Three thousand talents of gold of Suphir, and seven thousand talents of fine silver, for the overlaying of the walls of the sanctuary:  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  005" id="29  005" >5</span>
    for you to use   the gold for   things of   gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for every work by the hand of the artificers. And who is willing to dedicate himself in work this day for the Lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  006" id="29  006" >6</span>
 Then the heads of families, and the princes of the children of Israel, and the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, and the overseers of the works, and the king's builders, offered willingly.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  007" id="29  007" >7</span>
 And they gave for the works of the house of the Lord five thousand talents of gold, and ten thousand gold   pieces  , and ten thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents of brass, and a hundred thousand talents of iron.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  008" id="29  008" >8</span>
 And they who had   precious   stone, gave it into the treasuries of the house of the Lord by the hand of Jeiel the Gedsonite.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  009" id="29  009" >9</span>
 And the people rejoiced because of the willingness, for they offered willingly to the Lord with a full heart: and king David rejoiced greatly.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  010" id="29  010" >10</span>
 And king David blessed the Lord before the congregation, saying, Blessed are you, O Lord God of Israel, our Father, from everlasting and to everlasting.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  011" id="29  011" >11</span>
 Your, O Lord,   is   the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the might: for you are Lord of all things that are in heaven and upon the earth: before your face every king and nation is troubled.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  012" id="29  012" >12</span>
 From you   come   wealth and glory: you, O Lord, rule over all, the Lord of all dominion, and in your hand   is   strength and rule; and   you are   almighty with your hand to increase and establish all things.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  013" id="29  013" >13</span>
 And now, Lord, we give thanks to you, and praise your glorious name.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  014" id="29  014" >14</span>
 But who am I, and what   is   my people, that we have been able to be thus forward   in offering   to you? for all things   are   your, and of your own have we given you,  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  015" id="29  015" >15</span>
 for we are strangers before you, and sojourners, as all our fathers   were  : our days upon the earth   are   as a shadow, and there is no remaining.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  016" id="29  016" >16</span>
 O Lord our God, as for all this abundance which I have prepared that a house should be built to your holy name, it is of your hand, and all   is   your.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  017" id="29  017" >17</span>
 And I know, Lord, that you are he that searches the hearts, and you love righteousness. I have willingly offered all these things in simplicity of heart; and now I have seen with joy your people here present, willingly offering to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  018" id="29  018" >18</span>
 O Lord God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, preserve these things in the thought of the heart of your people for ever, and direct their hearts to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  019" id="29  019" >19</span>
 And to Solomon my son give a good heart, to perform your commandments, and   to observe   your testimonies, and your ordinances, and to accomplish the building of your house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  020" id="29  020" >20</span>
 And David said to the whole congregation, Bless youÂ° the Lord our God. And all the congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers, and they bowed the knee and worshipped the Lord, and   did obeisance   to the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  021" id="29  021" >21</span>
 And David sacrificed to the Lord, and offered up whole burnt offerings to the Lord on the morrow after the first day, a thousand calves, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, and their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  022" id="29  022" >22</span>
 And they ate and drank joyfully that day before the Lord: and they made Solomon the son of David king a second time, and anointed him king before the Lord, and Sadoc to the priesthood.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  023" id="29  023" >23</span>
 And Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David, and was highly honored; and all Israel obeyed him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  024" id="29  024" >24</span>
 The princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons of king David his father, were subject to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  025" id="29  025" >25</span>
 And the Lord magnified Solomon over all Israel, and gave him royal glory, such as was not upon any king before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  026" id="29  026" >26</span>
 And David the son of Jessae reigned over Israel forty years;  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  027" id="29  027" >27</span>
 seven years in Chebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  028" id="29  028" >28</span>
 And he died in a good old age, full of days, in wealth, and glory: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  029" id="29  029" >29</span>
 And the rest of the acts of David, the former and the latter, are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,  <span class="verse" rel="v01329  030" id="29  030" >30</span>
 concerning all his reign, and his power, and the times which went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the earth.
