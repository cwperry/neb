<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">T</span>he word of the Lord which came to Sophonias the son of Chusi, the son of Godolias, the son of Amorias, the son of Ezekias, in the days of Josias son of Amon, king of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v0361  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 Let there be an utter cutting off from the face of the land, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0361  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 Let man and cattle be cut off; let the birds of the air and the fishes of the sea be cut off; and the ungodly shall fail, and I will take away the transgressors from the face of the land, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0361  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And I will stretch out my hand upon Juda, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will remove the names of Baal out of this place, and the names of the priests;  <span class="verse" rel="v0361  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship and swear by the Lord, and them that swear by their king;  <span class="verse" rel="v0361  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 and them that turn aside from the Lord, and them that seek not the Lord, and them that cleave not to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0361  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 Fear you° before the Lord God; for the day of the Lord is near; for the Lord has prepared his sacrifice, and has sanctified his guests.  <span class="verse" rel="v0361  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 And it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord's sacrifice, that I will take vengeance on the princes, and on the king's house, and upon all that wear strange apparel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0361  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 And I will openly take vengeance on the porches in that day,   on the men   that fill the house of the Lord their God with ungodliness and deceit.  <span class="verse" rel="v0361  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 And there shall be in that day, says the Lord, the sound of a cry from the gate of men slaying, and a howling from the second   gate  , and a great crashing from the hills.  <span class="verse" rel="v0361  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 Lament, you° that inhabit the   city   that has been broken down, for all the people has become like Chanaan; and all that were exalted by silver have been utterly destroyed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0361  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 And it shall come to pass in that day,   that   I will search Jerusalem with a candle, and will take vengeance on the men that despise the things committed to them; but they say in their hearts, The Lord will not do any good, neither will he do any evil.  <span class="verse" rel="v0361  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 And their power shall be for a spoil, and their houses for utter desolation; and they shall build houses, but shall not dwell in them; and they shall plant vineyards, but shall not drink the wine of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0361  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 For the great day of the Lord   is   near,   it is   near, and very speedy; the sound of the day of the Lord is made bitter and harsh.  <span class="verse" rel="v0361  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 A mighty day of wrath is that day, a day of affliction and distress, a day of desolation and destruction, a day of gloominess and darkness, a day of cloud and vapor,  <span class="verse" rel="v0361  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 a day of the trumpet and cry against the strong cities, and against the high towers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0361  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 And I will greatly afflict the men, and they shall walk as blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord; therefore he shall pour out their blood as dust, and their flesh as dung.  <span class="verse" rel="v0361  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 And their silver and their gold shall in nowise be able to rescue them in the day of the Lord's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealously; for he will bring a speedy destruction on all them that inhabit the land.  
<!-- 2   018 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> Be you° gathered and closely joined together, O unchastened nation;  <span class="verse" rel="v0362  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 before you° become as the flower that passes away, before the anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the wrath of the Lord come upon you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0362  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 Seek you° the Lord, all you° meek of the earth; do judgment, and seek justice, and answer accordingly; that you° may be hid in the day of the wrath of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0362  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 For Gaza shall be utterly spoiled, and Ascalon shall be destroyed; and Azotus shall be cast forth at noon-day, and Accaron shall be rooted up.  <span class="verse" rel="v0362  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 Woe to them that dwell on the border of the sea, neighbors of the Cretans! the word of the Lord is against you, O Chanaan, land of the Philistines, and I will destroy you out of   your   dwelling-place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0362  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 And Crete shall be a pasture of flocks, and a fold of sheep.  <span class="verse" rel="v0362  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 And the sea cost shall be for the remnant of the house of Juda; they shall pasture upon them in the houses of Ascalon; they shall rest in the evening because of the children of Juda; for the Lord their God has visited them, and he will turn away their captivity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0362  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 I have heard the revilings of Moab, and the insults of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reviled my people, and magnified themselves against my coasts.  <span class="verse" rel="v0362  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 Therefore,   as   I live, says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Moab shall be as Sodoma, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrha; and Damascus   shall be   left as a heap of the threshing floor, and desolate for ever: and the remnant of my people shall plunder them, and the remnant of my nations shall inherit them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0362  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 This is their punishment in return for their haughtiness, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0362  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 The Lord shall appear against them, and shall utterly destroy all the gods of the nations of the earth; and they shall worship him every one from his place,   even   all the islands of the nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0362  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 You° Ethiopians also are the slain of my sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v0362  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 And he shall stretch forth his hand against the north and destroy the Assyrian, and make Nineve a dry wilderness,   even   as a desert.  <span class="verse" rel="v0362  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 And flocks, and all the wild beasts of the land, and chameleons shall feed in the midst thereof: and hedgehogs shall lodge in the ceilings thereof; and wild beasts shall cry in the breaches thereof, and ravens in her porches, whereas her loftiness was   as   as cedar.  
<!-- 3   014 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> This is the scornful city that dwells securely, that says in her heart, I am, and there is no longer any   to be   after me: how is she become desolate, a habitation of wild beasts! every one that passes through her shall hiss, and shake his hands. Alas the glorious and ransomed city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0363  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 The dove listened not to the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the Lord, and she drew not near to her God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0363  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 Her princes within her were as roaring lions, her judges as the wolves of Arabia; they remained not till the morrow.  <span class="verse" rel="v0363  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 Her prophets are light   and   scornful men: her priests profane the holy things, and sinfully transgress the law.  <span class="verse" rel="v0363  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 But the just Lord is in the midst of her, and he will never do an unjust thing: morning by morning he will bring out his judgment to the light, and it is not hidden, and he knows not injustice by extortion, nor injustice in strife.  <span class="verse" rel="v0363  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 I have brought down the proud with destruction; their corners are destroyed: I will make their ways completely waste, so that none shall go through: their cities are come to an end, by reason of no man living or dwelling   in them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0363  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 I said, But do you° fear me, and receive instruction, and you° shall not be cut off from the face of the land   for   all the vengeance I have brought upon her: prepare you, rise early: all their produce is spoilt.  <span class="verse" rel="v0363  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 Therefore wait upon me, says the Lord, until the day when I rise up for a witness: because my judgment   shall be   on the gatherings of the nations, to draw to me kings, to pour out upon them all   my   fierce anger: for the whole earth shall be consumed with the fire of my jealousy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0363  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 For then will I turn to the peoples a tongue for her generation, that all may call on the name of the Lord, to serve him under one yoke.  <span class="verse" rel="v0363  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 From the boundaries of the rivers of Ethiopia will I receive my dispersed ones; they shall offer sacrifices to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0363  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 In that day you shall not be ashamed of all your practices, wherein you have transgressed against me: for then will I take away from you your disdainful pride, and you shall no more magnify yourself upon my holy mountain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0363  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 And I will leave in you a meek and lowly people;  <span class="verse" rel="v0363  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 and the remnant of Israel shall fear the name of the Lord, and shall do no iniquity, neither shall they speak vanity; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed, and lie down, and there shall be none to terrify them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0363  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 Rejoice, O daughter of Sion; cry aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem; rejoice and delight yourself with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0363  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 The Lord has taken away your iniquities, he has ransomed you from the hand of your enemies: the Lord, the King of Israel, is in the midst of you: you shall not see evil any more.  <span class="verse" rel="v0363  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 At that time the Lord shall say to Jerusalem, Be of good courage, Sion; let not your hands be slack.  <span class="verse" rel="v0363  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 The Lord your God is in you; the Mighty One shall save you: he shall bring joy upon you, and shall refresh you with his love; and he shall rejoice over you with delight as in a day of feasting.  <span class="verse" rel="v0363  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 And I will gather your afflicted ones. Alas! who has taken up a reproach against her?  <span class="verse" rel="v0363  019" id="3  019" >19</span>
 Behold, I   will   work in you for your sake at that time, says the Lord: and I will save her that was oppressed, and receive her that was rejected; and I will make them a praise, and honored in all the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0363  020" id="3  020" >20</span>
 And   their enemies   shall be ashamed at that time, when I shall deal well with you, and at the time when I shall receive you: for I will make you honored and a praise among all the nations of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before you, says the Lord.
