<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 Charge the children of Israel, and let them send forth out of the camp every leper, and every one who has in issue of the reins, and every one who is unclean from a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   soul.  </span>  dead body.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 Whether male or female, send them forth out of the camp; and they shall not defile their camps in which I dwell among them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 And the children of Israel did so, and sent them out of the camp: as the Lord said to Moses, so did the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Every man or woman who shall commit any sin that is common to man, or if that soul shall in anyway have neglected the commandment and transgressed;  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
    that person   shall confess the sin which he has committed, and shall make satisfaction for his trespass: he   shall pay   the principal, and shall add to it the fifth part, and shall make restoration to him against whom he has trespassed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 But if a man have no near kinsman, so as to make satisfaction for his trespass to him, the trespass-offering paid to the Lord shall be for the priest, besides the ram of atonement, by which he shall make atonement with it for him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 And every first fruits in all the sanctified things among the children of Israel, whatever they shall offer to the Lord, shall be for the priest himself.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 And the hallowed things of every man shall be his; and whatever man shall give   any thing   to the priest, the gift shall be his.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  011" id="5  011" >11</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  012" id="5  012" >12</span>
 Speak to the children of Israel, and you shall say to them, Whosesoever wife shall transgress against him, and slight and despise him,  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  013" id="5  013" >13</span>
 and   supposing   any one shall lie with her carnally, and the thing shall be hid from the eyes of her husband, and she should conceal it and be herself defiled, and there be no witness with her, and she should not be taken;  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 and there should come upon him a spirit of jealousy, and he should be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled; or there should come upon him a spirit of jealousy, and he should be jealous of his wife, and she should not be defiled;  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  015" id="5  015" >15</span>
 then shall the man bring his wife to the priest, and shall bring his gift for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley-meal: he shall not pour oil upon it, neither shall he put frankincense upon it; for it is a sacrifice of jealousy, a sacrifice of memorial, recalling sin to remembrance.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  016" id="5  016" >16</span>
 And the priest shall bring her, and cause her to stand before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  017" id="5  017" >17</span>
 And the priest shall take pure running water in an earthen vessel, and he shall take of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle of witness, and the priest having taken it shall cast it into the water.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  018" id="5  018" >18</span>
 And the priest shall cause the woman to stand before the Lord, and shall uncover the head of the woman, and shall put into her hands the sacrifice of memorial, the sacrifice of jealousy; and in the hand of the priest shall be the water of this conviction that brings the curse.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  019" id="5  019" >19</span>
 And the priest shall adjure her, and shall say to the woman, If no one has lain with you, and if you have not transgressed so as to be polluted, being under the power of your husband, be free from this water of the conviction that causes the curse.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  020" id="5  020" >20</span>
 But if being a married woman you have transgressed, or been polluted, and any one has lain with you, beside your husband:  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  021" id="5  021" >21</span>
 then the priest shall adjure the woman by the oaths of this curse, and the priest shall say to the woman, The Lord bring you into a curse and under an oath in the midst of your people, in that the Lord should cause your thigh to rot and your belly to swell;  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  022" id="5  022" >22</span>
 and this water bringing the curse shall enter into your womb to cause your belly to swell, and your thigh to rot. And the woman shall say, So be it, So be it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  023" id="5  023" >23</span>
 And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and shall blot them out  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in.  </span>  with the water of the conviction that brings the curse.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  024" id="5  024" >24</span>
 And he shall cause the woman to drink the water of the conviction that brings the curse; and the water of the conviction that brings the curse shall enter into her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  025" id="5  025" >25</span>
 And the priest shall take from the hand of the woman the sacrifice of jealousy, and shall present the sacrifice before the Lord, and shall bring it to the altar.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  026" id="5  026" >26</span>
 And the priest shall take a handful of the sacrifice as a memorial of it, and shall offer it up upon the altar; and afterwards he shall cause the woman to drink the water.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  027" id="5  027" >27</span>
 And it shall come to pass, if she be defiled, and have altogether escaped the notice of her husband, then the water of the conviction that brings the curse shall enter into her; and she shall swell in her belly, and her thigh shall rot, and the woman shall be for a curse in the midst of her people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  028" id="5  028" >28</span>
 But if the woman have not been polluted, and be clean, then shall she be guiltless and shall  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   give out seed.  </span>  conceive seed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  029" id="5  029" >29</span>
 This is the law of jealousy, wherein a married woman should happen to transgress, and be defiled;  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  030" id="5  030" >30</span>
 or in the case of a man on whoever the spirit of jealousy should come, and he should be jealous of his wife, and he should place his wife before the Lord, and the priest shall execute towards her all this law.  <span class="verse" rel="v0045  031" id="5  031" >31</span>
 Then the man shall be clear from sin, and that woman shall bear her sin.

<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 Speak to Aaron, and you shall say to him, Whenever you shall set the lamps in order, the seven lamps shall give light opposite the candlestick.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 And Aaron did so: on one side opposite the candlestick he lighted its lamps, as the Lord appointed Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  004" id="8  004" >4</span>
 And this   is   the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   Appointment, or arrangement.  </span>  construction of the candlestick:   it is   solid, golden—its stem, and its lilies—all solid: according to the pattern which the Lord showed Moses, so he made the candlestick.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 Take the Levites out of the midst of the children of Israel, and you shall purify them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  007" id="8  007" >7</span>
 And thus shall you perform their purification: you shall sprinkle them with water of purification, and a razor shall come upon the whole of their body, and they shall wash their garments, and shall be clean.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  008" id="8  008" >8</span>
 And they shall take one calf of the herd, and its meat-offering, fine flour mingled with oil: and you shall take a calf of a year old of the herd for a sin-offering.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 And you shall bring the Levites before the tabernacle of witness; and you shall assemble all the congregation of the sons of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 And you shall bring the Levites before the Lord; and the sons of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  011" id="8  011" >11</span>
 And Aaron shall separate the Levites for a gift before the Lord from the children of Israel: and they shall be prepared  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   so as to perform.  </span>  to perform the works of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  012" id="8  012" >12</span>
 And the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the calves; and you shall offer one for a sin-offering, and the other for a whole burnt offering to the Lord, to make atonement for them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 And you shall set the Levites before the Lord, and before Aaron, and before his sons; and you shall give them as a gift before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 And you shall separate the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel, and they shall be mine.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  015" id="8  015" >15</span>
 And afterwards the Levites shall go in to perform the works of the tabernacle of witness; and you shall purify them, and present them before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  016" id="8  016" >16</span>
 For these are given to me for a present out of the midst of the children of Israel: I have taken them to myself instead of all the firstborn of the sons of Israel that open every womb.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  017" id="8  017" >17</span>
 For every firstborn among the children of Israel   is   mine, whether of man or beast: in the day in which I struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them to myself.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  018" id="8  018" >18</span>
 And I took the Levites in the place of every firstborn among the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  019" id="8  019" >19</span>
 And I gave the Levites presented as a gift to Aaron and his sons out of the midst of the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of witness, and to make atonement for the children of Israel: thus there shall be none among the sons of Israel to draw near to the holy things.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  020" id="8  020" >20</span>
 And Moses and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites as the Lord commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the sons of Israel did to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  021" id="8  021" >21</span>
 So the Levites purified themselves and washed their garments; and Aaron presented them as a gift before the Lord, and Aaron made atonement for them to purify them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  022" id="8  022" >22</span>
 And afterwards the Levites went in to minister in their service in the tabernacle of witness before Aaron, and before his sons; as the Lord appointed Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  023" id="8  023" >23</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  024" id="8  024" >24</span>
 This is the   ordinance   for the Levites; From five and twenty years old and upward, they shall go in to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   do the work.  </span>  minister in the tabernacle of witness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  025" id="8  025" >25</span>
 And from fifty years old   the Levites   shall cease from the ministry, and shall not work any longer.  <span class="verse" rel="v0048  026" id="8  026" >26</span>
 And his brother shall serve in the tabernacle of witness to keep charges, but he shall not do works: so shall you do to the Levites in their charges.

<p><span class="chapter" id="9  001">9  </span> And the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sina in the second year after they had gone forth from the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  002" id="9  002" >2</span>
 Speak, and let the children of Israel keep the passover in its season.  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  003" id="9  003" >3</span>
 On the fourteenth day of the first month at even, you shall keep it in its season; you shall keep it according to its law, and according to its ordinance.  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  004" id="9  004" >4</span>
 And Moses ordered the children of Israel to sacrifice the passover,  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  005" id="9  005" >5</span>
 on the fourteenth day of the first month in the wilderness of Sina, as the Lord appointed Moses, so the children of Israel did.  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
 And there came men who were unclean by reason of a dead body, and they were not able to keep the passover on that day; and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 And those men said to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   him.  </span>  Moses, We are unclean by reason of the dead body of a man: shall we therefore fail to offer the gift to the Lord in its season in the midst of the children of Israel?  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 And Moses said to them, stand there, and I will hear what charge the Lord will give concerning you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  010" id="9  010" >10</span>
 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Whatever man shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or on a journey far off, among you, or among your posterity; he shall then keep the passover to the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  011" id="9  011" >11</span>
 in the second month, on the fourteenth day; in the evening they shall offer it, with unleavened bread and bitter herbs shall they eat it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  012" id="9  012" >12</span>
 They shall not leave of it until the morrow, and they shall not break a bone of it; they shall sacrifice it according to the ordinance of the passover.  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  013" id="9  013" >13</span>
 And whatever man shall be clean, and is not far off on a journey, and shall fail to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people, because he has not offered the gift to the Lord in its season: that man shall bear his iniquity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  014" id="9  014" >14</span>
 And if there should come to you a stranger in your land, and should keep the passover to the Lord, he shall keep it according to the law of the passover and according to its ordinance: there shall be one law for you, both for the stranger, and for the native of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  015" id="9  015" >15</span>
 And in the day in which the tabernacle was pitched the cloud covered the tabernacle, the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   house.  </span>  place of the testimony; and in the evening there was upon the tabernacle as the appearance of fire till the morning.  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  016" id="9  016" >16</span>
 So it was continually: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  017" id="9  017" >17</span>
 And when the cloud went up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel departed; and in whatever place the cloud rested, there the children of Israel encamped.  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  018" id="9  018" >18</span>
 The children of Israel shall encamp by the command of the Lord, and by the command of the Lord they shall remove: all the days in which the cloud overshadows the tabernacle, the children of Israel shall encamp. And whenever the cloud shall be drawn over the tabernacle for many days, then the children of Israel shall keep the charge of God, and they shall not remove.  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  019" id="9  019" >19</span>
 And it shall be, whenever the cloud overshadows the tabernacle  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   days by number.  </span>  a number of days, they shall encamp by the word of the Lord, and shall remove by the command of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  020" id="9  020" >20</span>
 And it shall come to pass, whenever the cloud shall remain from the evening till the morning, and in the morning the cloud shall go up, then shall they remove by day or by night.  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  021" id="9  021" >21</span>
 When the cloud continues  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   more than a month.  </span>  a full month overshadowing the tabernacle, the children of Israel shall encamp, and shall not depart.  <span class="verse" rel="v0049  022" id="9  022" >22</span>

 But now our soul is dried up; our eyes   turn   to nothing but to the manna.  <span class="verse" rel="v00411  007" id="11  007" >7</span>
 And the manna is as coriander seed, and the appearance of it the appearance of hoarfrost.  <span class="verse" rel="v00411  008" id="11  008" >8</span>
 And the people went through the field, and gathered, and ground it in the mill, or pounded it in a mortar, and baked it in a pan, and made cakes of it; and the sweetness of it was as the taste   of   wafer made with oil.  <span class="verse" rel="v00411  009" id="11  009" >9</span>
 And when the dew came upon the camp by night, the manna came down upon it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00411  010" id="11  010" >10</span>

 I shall not be able to bear this people alone, for this thing is too heavy for me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00411  015" id="11  015" >15</span>

 And Moses went out, and spoke the words of the Lord to the people; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and he set them round about the tabernacle.  <span class="verse" rel="v00411  025" id="11  025" >25</span>
 And the Lord came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy men that were elders; and when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied and ceased.  <span class="verse" rel="v00411  026" id="11  026" >26</span>
 And there were two men left in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Modad; and the spirit rested upon them, and these were of the number of them that were enrolled, but they did not come to the tabernacle; and they prophesied in the camp.  <span class="verse" rel="v00411  027" id="11  027" >27</span>
 And a young man ran and told Moses, and spoke, saying, Eldad and Modad prophesy in the camp.  <span class="verse" rel="v00411  028" id="11  028" >28</span>
 And Joshua the son of Naue, who attended on Moses, the chosen one, said,   My   lord Moses, forbid them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00411  029" id="11  029" >29</span>
 And Moses said to him, Are you jealous on my account? and would that all the Lord's people were prophets; whenever the Lord shall put his spirit upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00411  030" id="11  030" >30</span>
 And Moses departed into the camp, himself and the elders of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00411  031" id="11  031" >31</span>
 And there went forth a wind from the Lord, and brought quails over from the sea; and it brought them down upon the camp a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on that side, round about the camp, as it were two cubits from the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v00411  032" id="11  032" >32</span>
 And the people rose up all the day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered quails; he that gathered  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   little.  </span>  least, gathered ten  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   cors.  </span>  measures; and they  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   refreshed refreshments to themselves.

 And the name of that place was called the Graves of Lust; for there they buried the people that lusted.  <span class="verse" rel="v00411  035" id="11  035" >35</span>
 The people departed from the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. קכווה החאוה Kibroth-hattaavah.  </span>  Graves of Lust to Aseroth; and the people  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   were in.  </span>  halted at Aseroth.

 Would we had died in the land of Egypt! or in this wilderness, would we had died! and why does the Lord bring us into this land to fall in war? our wives and our children shall be for a prey: now then it is better to return into Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  004" id="14  004" >4</span>
 And they said one to another, Let us make a ruler, and return into Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  005" id="14  005" >5</span>
 And Moses and Aaron fell upon their face before all the congregation of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  006" id="14  006" >6</span>
 But Joshua the   son   of Naue, and Chaleb the   son   of Jephonne, of   the number of   them that spied out the land, tore their garments,  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  007" id="14  007" >7</span>
 and spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, The land which we surveyed is indeed extremely good.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  008" id="14  008" >8</span>
 If the Lord choose us, he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which flows with milk and honey.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  009" id="14  009" >9</span>
 Only depart not from the Lord; and fear you° not the people of the land, for they are meat for us; for the season   of prosperity   is departed from them, but the Lord   is   among us: fear them not.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  010" id="14  010" >10</span>
 And all the congregation bade stone them with stones; and the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud on the tabernacle of witness to all the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  011" id="14  011" >11</span>
 And the Lord said to Moses, How long does this people provoke me? and how long do they  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   not believe me.  </span>  refuse to believe me for all the signs which I have wrought among them?  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  012" id="14  012" >12</span>
 I will strike them with death, and destroy them; and I will make of you and of your father's house a great nation, and much greater than this.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  013" id="14  013" >13</span>
 And Moses said to the Lord, So Egypt shall hear, for you have brought up this people from them by your might.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  014" id="14  014" >14</span>
 Moreover all the dwellers upon this land have heard that you are Lord in the midst of this people, who, O Lord, are seen   by them   face to face, and your cloud rests upon them, and you go before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, and by night in a pillar of fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  015" id="14  015" >15</span>
 And   if   you shall destroy this nation as one man; then all the nations that have heard your name shall speak, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  016" id="14  016" >16</span>
 Because the Lord could not bring this people into the land which he sware to them, he has overthrown them in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  017" id="14  017" >17</span>
 And now, O Lord, let your strength be exalted, as you spoke, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  018" id="14  018" >18</span>
 The Lord   is   longsuffering and merciful, and true, removing transgressions and iniquities and sins, and he will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  019" id="14  019" >19</span>
 Forgive this people their sin according to your great mercy, as you were favourable to them from Egypt until now.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  020" id="14  020" >20</span>
 And the Lord said to Moses, I am gracious to them according to your word.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  021" id="14  021" >21</span>
 But   as   I live and my name is living, so the glory of the Lord shall fill all the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  022" id="14  022" >22</span>
 For all the men who see my glory, and the signs which I wrought in Egypt, and in the wilderness, and have tempted me this tenth time, and have not listened to my voice,  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  023" id="14  023" >23</span>
 surely they shall not see the land, which I sware to their fathers; but their children which are with me here, as many as know not good or evil, every inexperienced youth, to them will I give the land; but none who have provoked me shall see it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  024" id="14  024" >24</span>
 But my servant Chaleb, because there was another spirit in him, and he followed me, I will bring him into the land into which he entered, and his seed shall inherit it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  025" id="14  025" >25</span>
 But Amalec and the Chananite dwell in the valley: to-morrow turn and depart for the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  026" id="14  026" >26</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  027" id="14  027" >27</span>
 How long   shall I endure   this wicked congregation? I have heard their murmurings against me,   even   the murmuring of the children of Israel, which they have murmured concerning you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  028" id="14  028" >28</span>
 Say to them,   As   I live, says the Lord: surely as you° spoke into my ears, so will I do to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  029" id="14  029" >29</span>
 Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all those of you that were reviewed, and those of you that were numbered from twenty years old and upward, all that murmured against me,  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  030" id="14  030" >30</span>
 you° shall not enter into the land for which I stretched out my hand to establish you upon it; except only Chaleb the son of Jephonne, and Joshua the   son   of Naue.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  031" id="14  031" >31</span>
 And your little ones, who you° said should be a prey, them will I bring into the land; and they shall inherit the land,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from which you° turned away.  </span>  which you° rejected.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  032" id="14  032" >32</span>
 And your carcases shall fall in this wilderness.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  033" id="14  033" >33</span>
 And your sons shall be fed in the wilderness forty years, and they shall bear your fornication, until your carcases be consumed in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  034" id="14  034" >34</span>
 According to the number of the days during which you° spied the land, forty days, a day for a year, you° shall bear your sins forty years, and you° shall know my fierce anger.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  035" id="14  035" >35</span>
 I the Lord have spoken, Surely will I do thus to this evil congregation  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See ἐπισύστασις 2. Cor 11. 28.  </span>  that has risen up together against me: in this wilderness they shall be utterly consumed, and there they shall die.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  036" id="14  036" >36</span>
 And the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, and who came and murmured against it to the assembly so as to bring out evil words concerning the land, —  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  037" id="14  037" >37</span>
 the men that spoke evil reports against the land, even died of the plague before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  038" id="14  038" >38</span>
 And Joshua the son of Naue and Chaleb the son of Jephonne   still   lived of those men that went to spy out the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  039" id="14  039" >39</span>
 And Moses spoke these words to all the children of Israel; and the people mourned exceedingly.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  040" id="14  040" >40</span>
 And they rose early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, Behold, we  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   these men.  </span>  that are here will go up to the place of which the Lord has spoken, because we have sinned.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  041" id="14  041" >41</span>
 And Moses said, Why do you° transgress the word of the Lord? you° shall not prosper.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  042" id="14  042" >42</span>
 Go not up, for the Lord is not with you; so shall you° fall before the face of your enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  043" id="14  043" >43</span>
 For Amalec and the Chananite   are   there before you, and you° shall fall by the sword; because you° have disobeyed the Lord and turned aside, and the Lord will not be among you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  044" id="14  044" >44</span>
 And having forced their passage, they went up to the top of the mountain; but the ark of the covenant of the Lord and Moses stirred not out of the camp.  <span class="verse" rel="v00414  045" id="14  045" >45</span>
 And Amalec and the Chananite that lived in that mountain came down, and routed them, and destroyed them to Herman; and they returned to the camp.

<p><span class="chapter" id="15  001">15  </span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  002" id="15  002" >2</span>
 Speak to the children of Israel, and you shall say to them, When you° are come into the land of your habitation, which I give to you,  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  003" id="15  003" >3</span>
 and you will offer whole burnt offerings to the Lord, a whole burnt offering or a meat-offering to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   magnify.  </span>  perform a vow, or a free-will offering, or to offer in your feasts a sacrifice of sweet savor to the Lord, whether of the herd or the flock:  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  004" id="15  004" >4</span>
 then he that offers his gift to the Lord shall bring a meat-offering of fine flour, a tenth part of an ephah mingled with oil, even with the fourth part of a hin.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  005" id="15  005" >5</span>
 And for a drink-offering you° shall offer the fourth part of a hin on the whole burnt offering, or on the meat-offering: for every lamb you shall offer so much, as a sacrifice, a smell of sweet savor to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  006" id="15  006" >6</span>
 And for a ram, when you° offer it as a whole burnt offering or as a sacrifice, you shall prepare as a meat-offering two tenths of fine flour mingled with oil, the third part of a hin.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  007" id="15  007" >7</span>
 And you° shall offer for a smell of sweet savor to the Lord wine for a drink-offering, the third part of a hin.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  008" id="15  008" >8</span>
 And if you° sacrifice   a bullock   from the herd for a whole burnt offering or for a sacrifice, to perform a vow or a peace-offering to the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  009" id="15  009" >9</span>
 then   the worshipper   shall offer upon the calf a meat-offering, three tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil,   even   the half of a hin.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  010" id="15  010" >10</span>
 And wine for a drink-offering the half of a hin, a sacrifice for a smell of sweet savor to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  011" id="15  011" >11</span>
 Thus shall you do to one calf or to one ram, or to one lamb of the sheep or kid of the goats.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  012" id="15  012" >12</span>
 According to the number of what you° shall offer, so shall you° do to each one, according to their number.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  013" id="15  013" >13</span>
 Every native of the country shall do thus to offer such things as sacrifices for a smell of sweet savor to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  014" id="15  014" >14</span>
 And if there should be a stranger among you in your land, or one who should be born to you among your generations, and he will offer a sacrifice, a smell of sweet savor to the Lord—as you° do, so the   whole   congregation shall offer to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  015" id="15  015" >15</span>
 There shall be one law for you and for the strangers dwelling among you, a perpetual law for your generations: as you°   are  , so shall the stranger be before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  016" id="15  016" >16</span>
 There shall be one law and one ordinance for you, and for the stranger that abides among you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  017" id="15  017" >17</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  018" id="15  018" >18</span>
 Speak to the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them, When you° are entering into the land, into which I bring you,  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  019" id="15  019" >19</span>
 then it shall come to pass, when you° shall eat of the bread of the land, you° shall separate a wave-offering, a special offering to the Lord, the first fruits of your dough.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  020" id="15  020" >20</span>
 You° shall offer your bread a heave-offering: as a heave-offering from the threshing floor, so shall you° separate it,  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  021" id="15  021" >21</span>
 even the first fruits of your dough, and you° shall give the Lord a heave-offering throughout your generations.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  022" id="15  022" >22</span>
 But whenever you° shall transgress, and not perform all these commands, which the Lord spoke to Moses;  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  023" id="15  023" >23</span>
 as the Lord appointed you by the hand of Moses, from the day which the Lord appointed you and forward throughout your generations,  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  024" id="15  024" >24</span>
 then it shall come to pass, if a trespass be committed unwillingly, unknown to the congregation, then shall all the congregation offer a calf of the herd without blemish for a whole burnt offering of sweet savor to the Lord, and its meat-offering and its drink-offering according to the ordinance, and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  025" id="15  025" >25</span>
 And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and   the trespass   shall be forgiven them, because it is involuntary; and they have brought their gift, a burnt offering to the Lord for their trespass before the Lord, even for their involuntary sins.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  026" id="15  026" >26</span>
 And it shall be forgiven as respects all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that is dwelling among you, because   it is   involuntary to all the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  027" id="15  027" >27</span>
 And if one soul sin unwillingly, he shall bring one she-goat of a year old for a sin-offering.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  028" id="15  028" >28</span>
 And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that committed the trespass unwillingly, and that sinned unwillingly before the Lord, to make atonement for him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  029" id="15  029" >29</span>
 There shall be one law for the native among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that abides among them, whoever shall commit a trespass unwillingly.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  030" id="15  030" >30</span>
 And whatever soul either of the natives or of the strangers shall do any thing with a presumptuous hand, he will provoke God; that soul shall be cut off from his people,  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  031" id="15  031" >31</span>
 for he has set at nothing the word of the Lord and broken his commands: that soul shall be utterly destroyed, his sin   is   upon him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  032" id="15  032" >32</span>
 And the children of Israel were in the wilderness, and they found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath-day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  033" id="15  033" >33</span>
 And they who found him gathering sticks on the sabbath-day brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  034" id="15  034" >34</span>
 And they placed him in custody, for they did not determine what they should do to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  035" id="15  035" >35</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Let the man be by all means put to death:   do you°   all the congregation, stone him with stones.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  036" id="15  036" >36</span>
 And all the congregation brought him forth out of the camp; and all the congregation stoned him with stones outside the camp, as the Lord commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  037" id="15  037" >37</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  038" id="15  038" >38</span>
 Speak to the children of Israel, and you shall tell them; and let them make for themselves fringes upon the borders of their garments throughout their generations: and you° shall put upon the fringes of the borders a lace of blue.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  039" id="15  039" >39</span>
 And it shall be on your fringes, and you° shall look on them, and you° shall remember all the commands of the Lord, and do them: and you° shall not turn back after your imaginations, and after   the sight of your   eyes in the things after which you° go a whoring;  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  040" id="15  040" >40</span>
 that you° may remember and perform all my commands, and you° shall be holy to your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00415  041" id="15  041" >41</span>
 I   am   the Lord your God that brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I   am   the Lord your God.

<p><span class="chapter" id="16  001">16  </span> And Core the son of Isaar the son of Caath the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiron, sons of Eliab, and Aun the son of Phaleth the son of Ruben, spoke;  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  002" id="16  002" >2</span>
 and rose up before Moses, and two hundred and fifty men of the sons of Israel, chiefs of the assembly, chosen councillors, and men of renown.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  003" id="16  003" >3</span>
 They rose up against Moses and Aaron, and said, Let it be enough for you that all the congregation   are   holy, and the Lord   is   among them; and why do you° set up yourselves against the congregation of the Lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  004" id="16  004" >4</span>
 And when Moses heard it, he fell on his face.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  005" id="16  005" >5</span>
 And he spoke to Core and all his assembly, saying, God has visited and known those that are his and who are holy, and has brought them to himself; and whom he has chosen for himself, he has brought to himself.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  006" id="16  006" >6</span>
 This do you°: take to yourselves censers, Core and all his company;  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  007" id="16  007" >7</span>
 and put fire on them, and put incense on them before the Lord to-morrow; and it shall come to pass that the man whom the Lord has chosen, he shall be holy: let it be enough for you, you° sons of Levi.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  008" id="16  008" >8</span>
 And Moses said to Core, Listen to me, you° sons of Levi.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  009" id="16  009" >9</span>
 Is it a little thing for you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, and brought you near to himself to minister in the services of the tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand before the tabernacle to minister for them?  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  010" id="16  010" >10</span>
 And he has brought you near and all your brethren the sons of Levi with you, and do you° seek to be priests also?  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  011" id="16  011" >11</span>
 Thus   it is with   you and all your congregation which is gathered together against God: and who is Aaron, that you° murmur against him?  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  012" id="16  012" >12</span>
 And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiron sons of Eliab; and they said, We  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   do not.  </span>  will not go up.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  013" id="16  013" >13</span>
 Is it a little thing that you have brought us up  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Some read, out of.  </span>  to a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness,   and   that you altogether rule over us?  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  014" id="16  014" >14</span>
 You are a prince, and have you brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, and have you given us an inheritance of land and vineyards? would you have  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   cut out.  </span>  put out the eyes of those men? we  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   do not.  </span>  will not go up.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  015" id="16  015" >15</span>
 And Moses was exceeding indignant, and said to the Lord, Do you take no heed to their sacrifice: I have not taken away  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        חפד for חפוד  </span>  the desire of any one of them, neither have I hurt any one of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  016" id="16  016" >16</span>
 And Moses said to Core, Sanctify your company, and be ready before the Lord, you and Aaron and they, to-morrow.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  017" id="16  017" >17</span>
 And take each man his censer, and you° shall put incense upon them, and shall bring each one his censer before the Lord, two hundred and fifty censers, and you and Aaron shall bring each his censer.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  018" id="16  018" >18</span>
 And each man took his censer, and they put on them fire, and laid incense on them; and Moses and Aaron stood by the doors of the tabernacle of witness.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  019" id="16  019" >19</span>
 And Core raised up against them all his company by the door of the tabernacle of witness; and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the congregation.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  020" id="16  020" >20</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  021" id="16  021" >21</span>

 And they fell on their faces, and said, O God, the God of spirits and of all flesh, if one man has sinned,   shall   the wrath of the Lord   be   upon the whole congregation?  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  023" id="16  023" >23</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  024" id="16  024" >24</span>
 Speak to the congregation, saying, Depart from the company of Core round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  025" id="16  025" >25</span>
 And Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiron, and all the elders of Israel went with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  026" id="16  026" >26</span>
 And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Separate yourselves from the tents of these stubborn men, and touch nothing that belongs to them, lest you° be consumed with them in all their sin.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  027" id="16  027" >27</span>
 And they stood aloof from the tent of Core round about; and Dathan and Abiron went forth and stood by the doors of their tents, and their wives and their children and their store.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  028" id="16  028" >28</span>
 And Moses said, Hereby shall you° know that the Lord has sent me to perform all these works, that   I have   not   done them   of myself.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  029" id="16  029" >29</span>
 If these men shall die according to the death of all men, if also their visitation shall be according to the visitation of all men, then the Lord has not sent me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  030" id="16  030" >30</span>

 And when he ceased speaking all these words, the ground clave asunder beneath them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  032" id="16  032" >32</span>
 And the ground opened, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that were with Core, and their cattle.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  033" id="16  033" >33</span>
 And they went down and all that they had, alive into Hades; and the ground covered them, and they perished from the midst of the congregation.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  034" id="16  034" >34</span>

 And fire went forth from the Lord, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  036" id="16  036" >36</span>
 And the Lord said to Moses,  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  037" id="16  037" >37</span>
 and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, Take up the brazen censers out of the midst of the men that have been burnt, and scatter the strange fire yonder, for they have sanctified the censers  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  038" id="16  038" >38</span>

 And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest took the brazen censers, which the men who had been burnt brought near, and they put them as a covering on the altar:  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  040" id="16  040" >40</span>
 a memorial to the children of Israel that no stranger might draw near, who is not of the seed of Aaron, to offer incense before the Lord; so he shall not be as Core and as they that conspired with him, as the Lord spoke to him by the hand of Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  041" id="16  041" >41</span>
 And the children of Israel murmured the next day against Moses and Aaron, saying, You° have killed the people of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  042" id="16  042" >42</span>
 And it came to pass when the congregation combined against Moses and Aaron, that they ran impetuously to the tabernacle of witness; and the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  043" id="16  043" >43</span>
 And Moses and Aaron went in, in front of the tabernacle of witness.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  044" id="16  044" >44</span>

 And Moses said to Aaron, Take a censer, and put on it fire from the altar, and put incense on it, and carry it away quickly into the camp, and make atonement for them; for wrath is gone forth from the presence of the Lord, it has begun to destroy the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  047" id="16  047" >47</span>
 And Aaron took as Moses spoke to him, and ran among the congregation, for already the plague had begun among the people; and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  048" id="16  048" >48</span>
 And he stood between the dead and the living, and the plague ceased.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  049" id="16  049" >49</span>
 And they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those that died on account of Core.  <span class="verse" rel="v00416  050" id="16  050" >50</span>
 And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tabernacle of witness, and the plague ceased.

 And Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation before the rock, and said to them, Hear me, you° disobedient ones; must we bring you water out of this rock?  <span class="verse" rel="v00420  011" id="20  011" >11</span>
 And Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his rod twice; and much water came forth, and the congregation drank, and their cattle.  <span class="verse" rel="v00420  012" id="20  012" >12</span>
 And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, Because you° have not believed me to sanctify me before the children of Israel, therefore you° shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00420  013" id="20  013" >13</span>
 This is the water of Strife, because the children of Israel spoke insolently before the Lord, and he was sanctified in them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00420  014" id="20  014" >14</span>
 And Moses sent messengers from Cades to the king of Edom, saying, Thus says your brother Israel; You know all the distress that has  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   found us  </span>  come upon us.  <span class="verse" rel="v00420  015" id="20  015" >15</span>
 And   how   our fathers went down into Egypt, and we sojourned in Egypt many days, and the Egyptians afflicted us and our fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v00420  016" id="20  016" >16</span>
 And we cried to the Lord, and the Lord heard our voice, and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt; and now we are in the city of Cades, at the extremity of your coasts.  <span class="verse" rel="v00420  017" id="20  017" >17</span>
 We will pass through your land: we will not go through the fields, nor through the vineyards, nor will we drink water out of your cistern: we will go by the king's highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left, until we have passed your borders.  <span class="verse" rel="v00420  018" id="20  018" >18</span>
 And Edom said to him, You shall not pass through me, and if otherwise, I will go forth to meet you in war.  <span class="verse" rel="v00420  019" id="20  019" >19</span>
 And the children of Israel say to him, We will pass by the mountain; and if I and my cattle drink of your water, I will pay you: but it is no matter of importance, we will go by the mountain.  <span class="verse" rel="v00420  020" id="20  020" >20</span>
 And he said, You shall not pass through me; and Edom went forth to meet him with a great host, and a mighty hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v00420  021" id="20  021" >21</span>
 So Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his borders, and Israel turned away from him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00420  022" id="20  022" >22</span>
 And they departed from Cades; and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to Mount Or.  <span class="verse" rel="v00420  023" id="20  023" >23</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron in mount Or, on the borders of the land of Edom, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00420  024" id="20  024" >24</span>
 Let Aaron be added to his people; for you° shall certainly not go into the land which I have given the children of Israel, because you° provoked me at the water of strife.  <span class="verse" rel="v00420  025" id="20  025" >25</span>
 Take Aaron, and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to the mount Or before all the congregation;  <span class="verse" rel="v00420  026" id="20  026" >26</span>
 and take Aaron's apparel from off him, and put it on Eleazar his son: and let Aaron die there and be added to   his people  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00420  027" id="20  027" >27</span>
 And Moses did as the Lord commanded him, and took him up to mount Or, before all the congregation.  <span class="verse" rel="v00420  028" id="20  028" >28</span>
 And he took Aaron's garments off him, and put them on Eleazar his son, and Aaron died on the top of the mountain; and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.  <span class="verse" rel="v00420  029" id="20  029" >29</span>
 And all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead: and they wept for Aaron thirty days,   even   all the house of Israel.

<p><span class="chapter" id="21  001">21  </span> And Arad the Chananitish king who lived by the wilderness, heard that Israel came by the way of Atharin; and he made war on Israel, and carried off  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a captivity of them.  </span>  some of them captives.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  002" id="21  002" >2</span>
 And Israel vowed a vow to the Lord, and said, If you will deliver this people into my power, I will devote it and its cities   to you  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  003" id="21  003" >3</span>
 And the Lord listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered the Chananite into his power; and   Israel   devoted him and his cities, and they called the name of that place  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   devoted thing.  </span>  Anathema.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  004" id="21  004" >4</span>
 And having departed from mount Or by the way   leading   to the Red Sea, they compassed the land of Edom, and the people lost courage by the way.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  005" id="21  005" >5</span>
 And the people spoke against God and against Moses, saying, Why is this? Hast you brought us ought of Egypt to kill us in the wilderness? for there is not bread nor water; and our soul loathes this light bread.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  006" id="21  006" >6</span>
 And the Lord sent among the people deadly serpents, and they bit the people, and much people of the children of Israel died.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  007" id="21  007" >7</span>
 And the people came to Moses and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against you: pray therefore to the Lord, and let him take away the serpent from us.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  008" id="21  008" >8</span>
 And Moses prayed to the Lord for the people; and the Lord said to Moses, Make you a serpent, and put it on a signal-  staff  ; and it shall come to pass that whenever a serpent shall bite a man, every one   so   bitten that looks upon it shall live.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  009" id="21  009" >9</span>
 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a signal-  staff  : and it came to pass that whenever a serpent bit a man, and he looked on the brazen serpent, he lived.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  010" id="21  010" >10</span>
 And the children of Israel departed, and encamped in Oboth.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  011" id="21  011" >11</span>
 And having departed from Oboth, they encamped in Achalgai, on the farther side in the wilderness, which is opposite Moab, toward the east.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  012" id="21  012" >12</span>
 And thence they departed, and encamped in the valley of Zared.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  013" id="21  013" >13</span>
 And they departed thence and encamped on the other side of Arnon in the wilderness,   the country   which extends from the coasts of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   Amorite  </span>  Amorites; for Arnon is the borders of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  014" id="21  014" >14</span>
 Therefore it is said in a book, A war of the Lord has set on fire Zoob, and the brooks of Arnon.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  015" id="21  015" >15</span>
 And he has appointed brooks to cause Er to dwell   there  ; and it lies near to the coasts of Moab.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  016" id="21  016" >16</span>
 And thence   they came to   the well; this   is   the well of which the Lord said to Moses, Gather the people, and I will give them water to drink.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  017" id="21  017" >17</span>
 Then Israel sang this song at the well, Begin   to sing    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   of the well for it  </span>  of the well;  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  018" id="21  018" >18</span>
 the princes digged it, the kings of the nations in their kingdom, in their lordship sank it in the rock: and   they went   from the well to Manthanain,  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  019" id="21  019" >19</span>
 and from Manthanain to Naaliel, and from Naaliel to Bamoth, and from Bamoth to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   Jané but the reading is uncertain.  </span>  Janen, which is in the plain of Moab   as seen   from the top of the quarried   rock   that looks toward the wilderness.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  020" id="21  020" >20</span>
 And Moses sent ambassadors to Seon king of the Amorites, with peaceful words, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  021" id="21  021" >21</span>
 We will pass through your land, we will go by the road; we will not turn aside to the field or to the vineyard.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  022" id="21  022" >22</span>
 We will not drink water out of your well; we will go by the king's highway, until we have past your boundaries.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  023" id="21  023" >23</span>
 And Seon did not allow Israel to pass through his borders, and Seon gathered all his people, and went out to set the battle in array against Israel into the wilderness; and he came to Jassa, and set the battle in array against Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  024" id="21  024" >24</span>
 And Israel struck him with the slaughter of the sword, and they became possessors of his land, from Arnon to Jaboc, as far as the children of Amman, for Jazer is the borders of the children of Amman.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  025" id="21  025" >25</span>
 And Israel took all their cities, and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Esebon, and in all cities belonging to it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  026" id="21  026" >26</span>
 For Esebon is the city of Seon king of the Amorites; and he before fought against the king of Moab, and they took all his land, from Aroer to Arnon.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  027" id="21  027" >27</span>
 Therefore say they who deal in dark speeches, Come to Esebon, that the city of Seon may be built and prepared.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  028" id="21  028" >28</span>
 For a fire has gone forth from Esebon, a flame from the city of Seon, and has consumed as far as Moab, and devoured the pillars of Arnon.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  029" id="21  029" >29</span>
 Woe to you, Moab; you are lost, you people of Chamos: their sons are sold for preservation, and their daughters are captives to Seon king of the Amorites.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  030" id="21  030" >30</span>
 And their seed shall perish   from   Esebon to Daebon; and their women have yet farther kindled a fire against Moab.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  031" id="21  031" >31</span>
 And Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  032" id="21  032" >32</span>
 And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took it, and its villages, and cast out the Amorite that lived there.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  033" id="21  033" >33</span>
 And having returned, they went up the road thhebraismat leads to Basan; and Og the king of Basan went forth to meet them, and all his people to war to Edrain.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  034" id="21  034" >34</span>
 And the Lord said to Moses, Fear him not; for I have delivered him and all his people, and all his land, into your hands; and you shall do to him as you did to Seon king of the Amorites, who lived in Esebon.  <span class="verse" rel="v00421  035" id="21  035" >35</span>
 And he struck him and his sons, and all his people, until he left none of his to be taken alive; and they inherited his land.

<p><span class="chapter" id="22  001">22  </span> And the children of Israel departed, and encamped on the west of Moab by Jordan toward Jericho.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  002" id="22  002" >2</span>
 And when Balac son of Sepphor saw all that Israel did to the Amorite,  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  003" id="22  003" >3</span>
 then Moab feared the people exceedingly because they were many; and Moab was grieved  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        q. d.   because of   hebraism. </span>  before the face of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  004" id="22  004" >4</span>
 And Moab said to the elders of Madiam, Now shall this assembly lick up all that are round about us, as a calf would lick up the green   herbs   of the field:—and Balac son of Sepphor was king of Moab at that time.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  005" id="22  005" >5</span>
 And he sent ambassadors to Balaam the son of Beor, to Phathura, which is on a river of the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, a people is come out of Egypt, and behold it has covered the face of the earth, and it has encamped close to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  006" id="22  006" >6</span>
 And now come, curse me this people, for it is stronger than we; if we may be able to strike some of them, and I will cast them out of the land: for I know that whoever you do bless, they are blessed, and whoever you do curse, they are cursed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  007" id="22  007" >7</span>
 And the elders of Moab went, and the elders of Madiam, and their divining   instruments were   in their hands; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balac.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  008" id="22  008" >8</span>
 And he said to them, Tarry here the night, and I will answer you the things which the Lord shall say to me; and the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  009" id="22  009" >9</span>
 And God came to Balaam, and said to him, Who are these men with you?  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  010" id="22  010" >10</span>
 And Balaam said to God, Balac son of Sepphor, king of Moab, sent them to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  011" id="22  011" >11</span>
 Behold, a people has come forth out of Egypt, and has covered the face of the land, and it has encamped near to me; and now come, curse it for me, if indeed I shall be able to strike it, and cast it out of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  012" id="22  012" >12</span>
 And God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them, neither shall you curse the people; for they are blessed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  013" id="22  013" >13</span>
 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balac, Depart quickly to your lord; God does not permit me to go with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  014" id="22  014" >14</span>
 And the princes of Moab rose, and came to Balac, and said, Balaam will not come with us.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  015" id="22  015" >15</span>
 And Balac yet again sent more princes and more honorable than they.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  016" id="22  016" >16</span>
 And they came to Balaam, and they say to him, Thus says Balac the son of Sepphor: I beseech you, delay not to come to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  017" id="22  017" >17</span>
 For I will greatly honor you, and will do for you whatever you shall say; come then, curse me this people.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  018" id="22  018" >18</span>
 And Balaam answered and said to the princes of Balac, If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I shall not be able to go beyond the word of the Lord God, to make it little or great in my mind.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  019" id="22  019" >19</span>
 And now do you° also wait here this night, and I shall know what the Lord will yet say to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  020" id="22  020" >20</span>
 And God came to Balaam by night, and said to him, If these men are come to call you, rise and follow them; nevertheless the word which I shall speak to you, it shall you do.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  021" id="22  021" >21</span>
 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  022" id="22  022" >22</span>
 And God was very angry because he went; and the angel of the Lord rose up to withstand him. Now he had mounted his ass, and his two servants were with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  023" id="22  023" >23</span>
 And when the ass saw the angel of God standing opposite in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand, then the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field; and   Balaam   struck the ass with his staff to direct her in the way.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  024" id="22  024" >24</span>
 And the angel of the Lord stood in the avenues of the vines, a fence   being   on this side and a fence on that.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  025" id="22  025" >25</span>
 And when the ass saw the angel of God, she thrust herself against the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall, and he struck her again.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  026" id="22  026" >26</span>
 And the angel of the Lord went farther, and came and stood in a narrow place where it was impossible to turn to the right or the left.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  027" id="22  027" >27</span>
 And when the ass saw the angel of God, she  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   sat down.  </span>  lay down under Balaam; and Balaam was angry, and struck the ass with his staff.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  028" id="22  028" >28</span>
 And God opened the mouth of the ass, and she says to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have struck me this third time?  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  029" id="22  029" >29</span>
 And Balaam said to the ass, Because you have mocked me; and if I   had   had a sword in my hand, I would now have killed you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  030" id="22  030" >30</span>
 And the ass says to Balaam,   Am   not I your ass on which you have ridden since your youth till this day? did I ever do thus to you, utterly disregarding   you  ? and he said, No.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  031" id="22  031" >31</span>
 And God opened the eyes of Balaam, and he sees the angel of the Lord withstanding   him   in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand, and he stooped down and worshipped on his face.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  032" id="22  032" >32</span>
 And the angel of God said to him, Why have you struck your ass this third time? and, behold, I came out to withstand you, for your way was not seemly before me; and when the ass saw me, she turned away from me this third time.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  033" id="22  033" >33</span>
 And if she had not turned out of the way, surely now, I should have slain you, and should have saved her alive.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  034" id="22  034" >34</span>
 And Balaam said to the angel of the Lord, I have sinned, for I did not know that you were standing opposite in the way to meet   me  ; and now if it shall not be pleasing to you   for me to go on  , I will return.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  035" id="22  035" >35</span>
 And the angel of the Lord said to Balaam, Go with the men: nevertheless the word which I shall speak to you, that you shall take heed to speak. And Balaam went with the princes of Balac.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  036" id="22  036" >36</span>
 And when Balac heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him, to a city of Moab, which is on the borders of Arnon, which is on the   extreme   part of the borders.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  037" id="22  037" >37</span>
 And Balac said to Balaam, Did I not send to you to call you? why have you not come to me? shall I not indeed be able to honor you?  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  038" id="22  038" >38</span>
 And Balaam said to Balac, Behold, I am now come to you: shall I be able to say anything? the word which God shall put into my mouth, that I shall speak.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  039" id="22  039" >39</span>
 And Balaam went with Balac, and they came to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   cities of villages.   Heb.  </span>  the cities of streets.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  040" id="22  040" >40</span>
 And Balac offered sheep and calves, and sent to Balaam and to his princes who were with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00422  041" id="22  041" >41</span>
 And it was morning; and Balac took Balaam, and brought him up to the pillar of Baal, and showed him thence a part of the people.

 And Balac did as Balaam told him; and he offered up a calf and a ram on   every   altar.  <span class="verse" rel="v00423  003" id="23  003" >3</span>

 And Balaam went to enquire of God; and he went straight forward, and God appeared to Balaam; and Balaam said to him, I have prepared the seven altars, and have offered a calf and a ram on   every   altar.  <span class="verse" rel="v00423  005" id="23  005" >5</span>

 And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, This   is   the thing which the Lord has commanded.  <span class="verse" rel="v00430  003" id="30  003" >3</span>
 Whatsoever man shall vow a vow to the Lord, or swear an oath, or bind himself with an obligation upon his soul, he shall not  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   profane  </span>  break his word; all that shall come out of his mouth he shall do.  <span class="verse" rel="v00430  004" id="30  004" >4</span>
 And if a woman shall vow a vow to the Lord, or bind herself with an obligation in her youth in her father's house; and her father should hear her vows and her obligations, wherewith she has bound her soul, and her father should hold his peace at her, then all her vows shall stand,  <span class="verse" rel="v00430  005" id="30  005" >5</span>
 and all the obligations with which she has bound her soul, shall remain to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v00430  006" id="30  006" >6</span>
 But if her father straitly forbid   her   in the day in which he shall hear all her vows and her obligations, which she has contracted upon her soul, they shall not stand; and the Lord shall hold her guiltless, because her father forbade her.  <span class="verse" rel="v00430  007" id="30  007" >7</span>

 But if her husband should  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   in any wise.  </span>  straitly forbid   her   in the day in which he should hear her, none of her vows or obligations which she has contracted upon her soul shall stand, because her husband has disallowed her, and the Lord shall hold her guiltless.  <span class="verse" rel="v00430  010" id="30  010" >10</span>
 And the vow of a widow and of her that is put away, whatever she shall  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   vow.  </span>  bind upon her soul, shall stand to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v00430  011" id="30  011" >11</span>

 But if he be wholly silent at her from day to day, then shall he bind upon her all her vows; and he shall confirm to her the obligations   which she has bound   upon herself, because he held his peace at her in the day in which he heard her.  <span class="verse" rel="v00430  016" id="30  016" >16</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="31  001">31  </span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  002" id="31  002" >2</span>
 Avenge the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   vengeance.  </span>  wrongs of the children of Israel on the Madianites, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   last.  </span>  afterwards you shall be added to your people.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  003" id="31  003" >3</span>
 And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   men.  </span>  some of you, and set yourselves in array before the Lord against Madian, to inflict vengeance on Madian from the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  004" id="31  004" >4</span>
 Send a thousand of each tribe from all the tribes of the children of Israel to set themselves in array.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  005" id="31  005" >5</span>
 And they numbered of the thousands of Israel a thousand of   each   tribe, twelve thousands;   these were   armed for war.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  006" id="31  006" >6</span>
 And Moses sent them away a thousand of every tribe with their forces, and Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest: and the holy instruments, and the signal trumpets   were   in their hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  007" id="31  007" >7</span>
 And they set themselves in array against Madian, as the Lord commanded Moses; and they killed every male.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  008" id="31  008" >8</span>
 And they killed the kings of Madian together with their slain   subjects  ; even Evi and Rocon, and Sur, and Ur, and Roboc, five kings of Madian; and they killed with the sword Balaam the son of Beor with their   other   slain.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  009" id="31  009" >9</span>
 And they made a prey of the women of Madian, and their store, and their cattle, and all their possessions: and they spoiled their forces.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  010" id="31  010" >10</span>
 And they burnt with fire all their cities in the places of their habitation and they burnt their villages with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  011" id="31  011" >11</span>
 And they took all their plunder, and all their spoils, both man and beast.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  012" id="31  012" >12</span>
 And they brought to Moses and to Eleazar the priest, and to all the children of Israel, the captives, and the spoils, and the plunder, to the camp to Araboth Moab, which is at Jordan by Jericho.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  013" id="31  013" >13</span>
 And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the rulers of the synagogue went forth out of the camp to meet them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  014" id="31  014" >14</span>
 And Moses was angry with the captains of the host, the heads of thousands and the heads of hundreds who came from the battle-array.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  015" id="31  015" >15</span>
 And Moses said to them, Why have you° saved every female alive?  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  016" id="31  016" >16</span>
 For they were   the occasion   to the children of Israel by the word of Balaam of their revolting and despising the word of the Lord, because of Phogor; and there was a plague in the congregation of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  017" id="31  017" >17</span>
 Now then kill every male in all the spoil, kill every woman, who has known the lying with man.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  018" id="31  018" >18</span>
 And as for all the captivity of women, who have not known the lying with man, save you° them alive.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  019" id="31  019" >19</span>
 And you° shall encamp outside the   great   camp seven days; every one who has slain and who touches a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        i. e.   of a slain man  </span>  dead body,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   shall purify himself.  </span>  shall be purified on the third day, and you° and your captivity   shall purify yourselves   on the seventh day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  020" id="31  020" >20</span>
 And you° shall purify every garment and every leather utensil, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   every work.  </span>  all furniture of goat skin, and every wooden vessel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  021" id="31  021" >21</span>
 And Eleazar the priest said to the men of the host that came from the battle-array, This   is   the ordinance of the law which the Lord has commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  022" id="31  022" >22</span>
 Beside the gold, and the silver, and the brass, and the iron, and lead, and tin,  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  023" id="31  023" >23</span>
 every thing that shall pass through the fire shall so be clean, nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of sanctification; and whatever will not pass through the fire shall pass through water.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  024" id="31  024" >24</span>
 And on the seventh day you° shall wash your garments, and be clean; and afterwards you° shall come into the camp.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  025" id="31  025" >25</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  026" id="31  026" >26</span>
 Take the sum of the spoils of the captivity both of man and beast, you and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the families of the congregation.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  027" id="31  027" >27</span>
 And you° shall divide the spoils between the warriors that went out to battle, and the whole congregation.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  028" id="31  028" >28</span>
 And you° shall take a tribute for the Lord from the warriors that went out to battle; one soul out of five hundred, from the men, and from the cattle, even from the oxen, and from the sheep, and from the asses; and you° shall take from their half.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  029" id="31  029" >29</span>
 And you shall give   them   to Eleazar the priest   as   the first fruits of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  030" id="31  030" >30</span>
 And from the half belonging to the children of Israel you shall take one  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from   or   of  </span>  in fifty from the men, and from the oxen, and from the sheep, and from the asses, and from all the cattle; and you shall give them to the Levites that keep the charges in the tabernacle of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  031" id="31  031" >31</span>
 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  032" id="31  032" >32</span>
 And that which remained of the spoil which the warriors took, was—of the sheep, six hundred and seventy-five thousand:  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  033" id="31  033" >33</span>
 and oxen, seventy-two thousand:  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  034" id="31  034" >34</span>
 and asses, sixty-one thousand.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  035" id="31  035" >35</span>
 And persons of women who had not known lying with man, all the souls, thirty-two thousand.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  036" id="31  036" >36</span>
 And the half,   even   the portion of them that went out to war, from the number of the sheep, was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand and five hundred.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  037" id="31  037" >37</span>
 And the tribute to the Lord from the sheep was six hundred and seventy-five.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  038" id="31  038" >38</span>
 And the oxen, six and thirty thousand, and the tribute to the Lord seventy-two.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  039" id="31  039" >39</span>
 And asses, thirty thousand and five hundred, and the tribute to the Lord, sixty-one:  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  040" id="31  040" >40</span>
 and the persons, sixteen thousand, and the tribute of them to the Lord, thirty-two souls.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  041" id="31  041" >41</span>
 And Moses gave the tribute to the Lord, the heave-offering of God, to Eleazar the priest, as the Lord commanded Moses;  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  042" id="31  042" >42</span>
 from the half belonging to the children of Israel, whom Moses separated from the men of war.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  043" id="31  043" >43</span>
 And the half   taken   from the sheep, belonging to the congregation, was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand and five hundred.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  044" id="31  044" >44</span>
 And the oxen, thirty-six thousand;  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  045" id="31  045" >45</span>
 asses, thirty thousand and five hundred;  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  046" id="31  046" >46</span>
 and persons, sixteen thousand.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  047" id="31  047" >47</span>
 And Moses took of the half belonging to the children of Israel  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the one out of the fifty.  </span>  the fifties part, of men and of cattle, and he gave them to the Levites who keep the charges of the tabernacle of the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  048" id="31  048" >48</span>
 And all those who were appointed to be officers of thousands of the host, captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, approached Moses, and said to Moses,  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  049" id="31  049" >49</span>
 Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war with us, and not one is missing.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  050" id="31  050" >50</span>
 And we have brought our gift to the Lord,   every   man who has found an article of gold, whether an armlet, or a chain, or a ring, or a bracelet, or a clasp for hair, to make atonement for us before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  051" id="31  051" >51</span>
 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, even every wrought article.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  052" id="31  052" >52</span>
 And all the wrought gold, even the offering that they offered to the Lord, was sixteen thousand and seven hundred and fifty shekels from the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  053" id="31  053" >53</span>
 For the men of war took plunder every one for himself.  <span class="verse" rel="v00431  054" id="31  054" >54</span>
 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, and brought the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   them.  </span>  vessels into the tabernacle of witness, a memorial of the children of Israel before the Lord.

 and the children of Ruben and the children of Gad came, and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00432  003" id="32  003" >3</span>
 Ataroth, and Daebon, and Jazer, and Namra, and Esebon, and Eleale, and Sebama, and Nabau, and Baean,  <span class="verse" rel="v00432  004" id="32  004" >4</span>
 the land which the Lord has delivered up before the children of Israel, is pasture land, and your servants have cattle.  <span class="verse" rel="v00432  005" id="32  005" >5</span>

 And why do you° pervert the minds of the children of Israel, that they should not cross over into the land, which the Lord gives them?  <span class="verse" rel="v00432  008" id="32  008" >8</span>
 Did not your fathers thus, when I sent them from Cades Barne to spy out the land?  <span class="verse" rel="v00432  009" id="32  009" >9</span>
 And they went up to the valley of the cluster, and spied the land, and turned aside the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land, which the Lord gave them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00432  010" id="32  010" >10</span>
 And the Lord was very angry in that day, and sware, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00432  011" id="32  011" >11</span>
 Surely these men who came up out of Egypt from twenty years old and upward, who know good and evil, shall not see the land which I sware   to give   to Abraam and Isaac and Jacob, for they have not closely followed after me:  <span class="verse" rel="v00432  012" id="32  012" >12</span>

 For you° will turn away from him to desert him yet once more in the wilderness, and you° will sin against this whole congregation.  <span class="verse" rel="v00432  016" id="32  016" >16</span>

 and we will arm ourselves and go as an advanced guard before the children of Israel, until we shall have brought them into their place; and our possessions shall remain in walled cities because of the inhabitants of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00432  018" id="32  018" >18</span>

 And as for the cities which you° shall give out of the possession of the children of Israel, from those   that have   much   you° shall give   much, and from those that have less you° shall give less: they shall give of their cities to the Levites each one according to his inheritance which they shall inherit.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  009" id="35  009" >9</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  010" id="35  010" >10</span>
 Speak to the children of Israel, and you shall say to them, You° are to cross over Jordan into the land of Chanaan.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  011" id="35  011" >11</span>
 And you° shall appoint to yourselves cities: they shall be to you cities of refuge for the slayer to flee to, every one who has  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   struck a life.  </span>  killed another unintentionally.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  012" id="35  012" >12</span>
 And the cities shall be to you places of refuge from  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   him that as kinsman represents the blood.  </span>  the avenger of blood, and the slayer shall not die until he stands before the congregation for judgment.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  013" id="35  013" >13</span>
 And the cities which you° shall assign,   even   the six cities, shall be places of refuge for you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  014" id="35  014" >14</span>
 You° shall assign three cities on the other side of Jordan, and you° shall assign three cities in the land of Chanaan.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  015" id="35  015" >15</span>
 It shall be a place of refuge for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for him that sojourns among you; these cities shall be for a place of refuge, for every one to flee there who has killed a man unintentionally.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  016" id="35  016" >16</span>
 And if he should strike him with an iron instrument, and the man should die, he is a murderer; let the murderer by all means be put to death.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  017" id="35  017" >17</span>
 And if he should strike him with a stone   thrown   from his hand, whereby a man may die, and he   thus   die, he is a murderer; let the murderer by all means be put to death.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  018" id="35  018" >18</span>
 And if he should strike him with an instrument of wood from his hand, whereby he may die, and he   thus   die, he is a murderer; let the murderer by all means be put to death.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  019" id="35  019" >19</span>
 The avenger of blood himself shall kill the murderer: whenever he shall meet him he shall kill him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  020" id="35  020" >20</span>
 And if he should thrust him through enmity, or cast any thing upon him from an ambuscade, and the man should die,  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  021" id="35  021" >21</span>
 or if he have struck him with his hand through anger, and the man should die, let the man that struck him be put to death by all means, he is a murderer: let the murderer by all means be put to death: the avenger of blood shall kill the murderer when he meets him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  022" id="35  022" >22</span>
 But if he should thrust him suddenly, not through enmity, or cast  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   any vessel   or   weapon.  </span>  any thing upon him, not from an ambuscade,  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  023" id="35  023" >23</span>
 or   strike him   with any stone, whereby a man may die, unawares, and it should fall upon him, and he should die, but he was not his enemy, nor sought to hurt him;  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  024" id="35  024" >24</span>
 then the assembly shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood, according to these judgments.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  025" id="35  025" >25</span>
 And the congregation shall rescue the slayer from the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, whither he fled for refuge; and he shall dwell there till the death of the high-priest, whom they anointed with the holy oil.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  026" id="35  026" >26</span>
 But if the slayer should in any wise go out beyond the bounds of the city whither he fled for refuge,  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  027" id="35  027" >27</span>
 and the avenger of blood should find him without the bounds of the city of his refuge, and the avenger of blood should kill the slayer, he is not guilty.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  028" id="35  028" >28</span>
 For  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   let him remain.  </span>  he ought to have remained in the city of refuge till the high-priest died; and after the death of the high-priest the slayer shall return to the land of his possession.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  029" id="35  029" >29</span>
 And these things shall be to you for an ordinance of judgment throughout your generations in all your dwellings.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  030" id="35  030" >30</span>
 Whoever  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   smites a life.  </span>  kills a man, you shall kill the murderer  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   by witnesses.  </span>  on the testimony of witnesses; and one witness shall not testify against a soul that he should die.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  031" id="35  031" >31</span>
 And you° shall not accept ransoms for life from a murderer who is worthy of death, for he shall be surely put to death.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  032" id="35  032" >32</span>
 You° shall not accept a ransom   to excuse   his fleeing to the city of refuge, so that he should again dwell in the land, until the death of the high-priest.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  033" id="35  033" >33</span>
 So shall you° not pollute with murder the land in which you° dwell; for this blood pollutes the land, and the land shall not be purged from the blood shed upon it, but by the blood of him that shed it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00435  034" id="35  034" >34</span>
 And you° shall not defile the land whereon you° dwell, on which I dwell in the midst of you; for I am the Lord dwelling in the midst of the children of Israel.

<p><span class="chapter" id="36  001">36  </span> And the heads of the tribe of the sons of Galaad the son of Machir the son of Manasse, of the tribe of the sons of Joseph, drew near, and spoke before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the heads of the houses of the families of the children of Israel:  <span class="verse" rel="v00436  002" id="36  002" >2</span>
 and they said, The Lord commanded our lord to render the land of inheritance by lot to the children of Israel; and the Lord appointed our lord to give the inheritance of Salpaad our brother to his daughters.  <span class="verse" rel="v00436  003" id="36  003" >3</span>
 And they will become wives in one of the tribes of the children of Israel; so their inheritance shall be taken away from the possession of our fathers, and shall be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which the women shall marry, and shall be taken away from the portion of our inheritance.  <span class="verse" rel="v00436  004" id="36  004" >4</span>
 And if there shall be a release of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which the women marry, and their inheritance, shall be taken away from the inheritance of our family's tribe.  <span class="verse" rel="v00436  005" id="36  005" >5</span>
 And Moses charged the children of Israel by the commandment of the Lord, saying, Thus  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   say.  </span>  says the tribe of the children of Joseph.  <span class="verse" rel="v00436  006" id="36  006" >6</span>
 This   is   the thing which the Lord has appointed the daughters of Salpaad, saying, Let them  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   be wives.  </span>  marry where they please, only let them marry   men   of their father's tribe.  <span class="verse" rel="v00436  007" id="36  007" >7</span>
 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel go about from tribe to tribe, for the children of Israel shall  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   be cemented. See Matt. 19. 5. Acts 5. 26.  </span>  steadfastly continue each in the inheritance of his family's tribe.  <span class="verse" rel="v00436  008" id="36  008" >8</span>
 And whatever daughter is heiress to a property of the tribes of the children Israel,   such   women shall be married each to one of her father's tribe, that the sons of Israel may each inherit the property of his father's tribe.  <span class="verse" rel="v00436  009" id="36  009" >9</span>
 And the inheritance shall not go about from one tribe to another, but the children of Israel shall steadfastly continue each in his own inheritance.  <span class="verse" rel="v00436  010" id="36  010" >10</span>
 As the Lord commanded Moses, so did they to the daughters of Salpaad.  <span class="verse" rel="v00436  011" id="36  011" >11</span>
 So Thersa, and Egla, and Melcha, and Nua, and Malaa, the daughters of Salpaad, married their cousins;  <span class="verse" rel="v00436  012" id="36  012" >12</span>
 they were married   to men   of the tribe of Manasse of the sons of Joseph; and their inheritance was attached to the tribe of their father's family.  <span class="verse" rel="v00436  013" id="36  013" >13</span>
 These   are   the commandments, and the ordinances, and the judgments, which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses, at the west of Moab, at Jordan by Jericho.
