<h2>(2 Kings) </h2>
<!-- 1   001 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">A</span>nd Moab  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   despised.  </span>  rebelled against Israel after the death of Achaab.  <span class="verse" rel="v0121  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 And Ochozias fell through the lattice that was in his upper chamber in Samaria and was sick; and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go and enquire of Baal fly, the god of Accaron, whether I shall recover of this my sickness. And they went to enquire of him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0121  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 And an angel of the Lord called Eliu the Thesbite, saying, Arise, and go to meet the messengers of Ochozias king of Samaria, and you shall say to them,   Is it   because there is no God in Israel,   that   you° go to enquire of Baal fly, the God of Accaron? but   it shall   not   be   so.  <span class="verse" rel="v0121  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 For thus says the Lord, The bed on which you are gone up, you shall not come down from it, for you shall surely die. And Eliu went, and said   so   to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0121  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 And the messengers returned to him, and he said to them, Why have you° returned?  <span class="verse" rel="v0121  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 And they said to him, A man came up to meet us, and said to us, Go, return to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus says the Lord,   Is it   because there is no God in Israel,   that   you go to enquire of Baal fly, the God of Accaron?   it shall   not   be   so: the bed on which you are gone up, you shall not come down from it, for you shall surely die.  <span class="verse" rel="v0121  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 So they returned and reported to the king as Eliu said: and he said to them, What   was   the manner of the man who went up to meet you, and spoke to you these words?  <span class="verse" rel="v0121  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 And they said to him,   He was   a hairy man, and girded with a leather girdle about his loins. And he said, This is Eliu the Thesbite.  <span class="verse" rel="v0121  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 And he sent to him a captain of fifty and his fifty; and he went up to him: and, behold, Eliu sat on the top of a mountain. And the captain of fifty spoke to him, and said, O man of God, the king has called you, come down.  <span class="verse" rel="v0121  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 And Eliu answered and said to the captain of fifty, And if I   am   a man of God, fire shall come down out of heaven, and devour you and your fifty. And fire came down out of heaven, and devoured him and his fifty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0121  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 And the king  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   added and sent.  </span>  sent a second time to him another captain of fifty, and his fifty. And the captain of fifty spoke to him, and said, O man of God, thus says the king, Come down quickly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0121  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 And Eliu answered and spoke to him, and said, If I   am   a man of God, fire shall come down out of heaven, and devour you and your fifty. And fire came down out of heaven, and devoured him and his fifty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0121  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 And the king  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   added yet to send.  </span>  sent yet again a captain and his fifty. And the third captain of fifty came, and knelt on his knees before Eliu, and entreated him, and spoke to him and said, O man of God, let my life, and the life of these fifty your servants, be precious in your eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0121  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 Behold, fire came down from heaven, and devoured the two first captains of fifty: and now, I pray, let my life be precious in your eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0121  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 And the angel of the Lord spoke to Eliu, and said, Go down with him, be not afraid of them. And Eliu rose up, and went down with him to the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0121  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 And Eliu spoke to him, and said, Thus says the Lord, Why have you sent messengers to enquire of Baal fly, the god of Accaron?   it shall   not   be   so: the bed on which you are gone up, you shall not come down from it, for you shall surely die.  <span class="verse" rel="v0121  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 So he died according to the word of the Lord which Eliu has spoken.  <span class="verse" rel="v0121  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 And the rest of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   words.  </span>  acts of Ochozias which he did, behold,   are   they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? and Joram son of Achaab reigns over Israel in Samaria twelve years   beginning   in the eighteenth year of Josaphat king of Juda: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, only not as his brethren, nor as his mother: and he removed the pillars of Baal which his father made, and broke them in pieces: only he was joined to the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who led Israel to sin; he departed not from them. And the Lord was very angry with the house of Achaab.

<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> And it came to pass, when the Lord was going to take Eliu with a whirlwind as it were into heaven, that Eliu and Elisaie went out of Galgala.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 And Eliu said to Elisaie, Stay here, I pray you; for God has sent me to Baethel. And Elisaie said,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the Lord lives if, etc.  </span>    As   the Lord lives and your soul lives, I will not leave you; so they came to Baethel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 And the sons of the prophets who were in Baethel came to Elisaie, and said to him,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   if you know.  </span>  Do you know, that the Lord this day  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   takes.  </span>  is going to take your lord away from your head? And he said, Yes, I know   it  ; be silent.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 And Eliu said to Elisaie, Stay here, I pray you; for the Lord has sent me to Jericho. And he said,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the Lord lives if, etc.  </span>    As   the Lord lives and your soul lives, I will not leave you. And they came to Jericho.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 And the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho drew near to Elisaie, and said to him, Do you know that the Lord is about to take away your master today from your head? And he said, Yes, I know   it  ; hold your peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 And Eliu said to him, Stay here, I pray you, for the Lord has sent me to Jordan. And Elisaie said,   As   the Lord lives and your soul lives, I will not leave you: and they both went on.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets   went also  , and they stood opposite afar off: and both stood on   the bank   of Jordan.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 And Eliu took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck the water: and the water was divided on this side and on that side, and they both went over  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   'into the wilderness.'  </span>  on dry ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 And it came to pass while they were crossing over, that Eliu said to Elisaie, Ask what I shall do for you before I am taken up from you. And Elisaie said, Let there be, I pray you,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   double   portions    in your spirit.  </span>  a double   portion   of your spirit upon me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 And Eliu said, You have  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   hardened in asking.  </span>  asked a hard thing: if you shall see me when I am taken up from you, then shall it be so to you; and if not, it shall not be   so  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 And it came to pass as they were going, they  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   went and talked.  </span>  went on talking; and, behold, a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and it separated between them both; and Eliu was taken up in a whirlwind as it were into heaven.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 And Elisaie saw, and cried, Father, father, the chariot of Israel, and the horseman thereof! And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his garments, and tore them into two pieces.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 And Elisaie took up the mantle of Eliu, which fell from off him upon Elisaie; and Elisaie returned, and stood upon the brink of Jordan;  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 and he took the mantle of Eliu, which fell from off him, and struck the water, and said, Where is the Lord God of Eliu?  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The   Gr.   here copies the   Heb. אח הו 'he also'.  </span>  and he struck the waters, and they were divided hither and there; and Elisaie went over.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 And the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho on the opposite side saw him, and said, The spirit of Eliu has rested upon Elisaie. And they came to meet him, and did obeisance to him to the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 And they said to him, Behold now,   there are   with your servants fifty men  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   sons of strength   Hebraism. </span>  of strength: let them go now, and seek your lord:  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   lest at any time.  </span>  perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up, and cast him into Jordan, or on one of the mountains, or on one of the hills. And Elisaie said, You° shall not send.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 And they pressed him until he was ashamed; and he said, Send. And they sent fifty men, and sought three days, and found him not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 And they returned to him, for he lived in Jericho: and Elisaie said, Did I not say to you, Go not?  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 And the men of the city said to Elisaie, Behold, the situation of the city   is   good, as   our   lord sees; but the waters   are   bad, and the ground barren.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 And Elisaie said, Bring me a new pitcher, and put salt in it. And they took   one  , and brought   it   to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 And Elisaie went out to the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and says, Thus says the Lord, I have healed these waters; there shall not be any longer death thence or barren   land  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 And the waters were healed until this day, according to the word of Elisaie which he spoke.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  023" id="2  023" >23</span>
 And he went up thence to Baethel: and as he was going up by the way there came up also little children from the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, bald-head, go up.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  024" id="2  024" >24</span>
 And he turned after them, and saw them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And, behold, there came out two bears out of the wood, and they tore forty and two children of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0122  025" id="2  025" >25</span>
 And he went thence to mount Carmel, and returned thence to Samaria.  
<!-- 3   025 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> And Joram the son of Achaab  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   reigned.  </span>  began to reign in Israel in the eighteenth year of Josaphat king of Juda, and he reigned twelve years.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, only not as his father, nor as his mother: and he removed the pillars of Baal which his father had made.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 Only he adhered to the sin of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin; he departed not from it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 And Mosa king of Moab was a sheep-master, and he rendered to the king of Israel  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   in the rising up.  </span>  in the beginning   of the year  , a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams, with the wool.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 And it came to pass, after the death of Achaab, that the king of Moab  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   despised.  </span>  rebelled against the king of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 And king Joram went forth in that day out of Samaria, and numbered Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 And he went and sent to Josaphat king of Juda, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: will you go with me against Moab to war? And he said, I will go up: you are as I, I am as you; as my people, so   is   your people, as my horses, so   are   your horses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 And he said, What way shall I go up? and he said, The way of the wilderness of Edom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 And the king of Israel went, and the king of Juda, and the king of Edom: and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   compassed a journey of seven days.  </span>  they fetched a compass of seven days' journey; and there was no water for the army, and for the cattle  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   at their feet.  </span>  that went with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the Lord should have called the three kings on their way, to give them into the hand of Moab.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 And Josaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and we will.  </span>  that we may enquire of the Lord by him? And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said,   There is   here Elisaie son of Saphat, who poured water on the hands of Eliu.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 And Josaphat said, He has the word of the Lord. And the king of Israel, and Josaphat king of Juda, and the king of Edom, went down to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 And Elisaie said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? go to the prophets of your father, and the prophets of your mother. And the king of Israel said to him,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   is it that.  </span>  Has the Lord called the three kings to deliver them into the hands of Moab?  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 And Elisaie said,   As   the Lord of hosts before whom I  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   stood.  </span>  stand lives, unless I  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   regard.  </span>  regarded the presence of Josaphat the king of Juda, I would not have looked on you, nor seen you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 And now fetch me a harper. And it came to pass, as the harper harped, that the hand of the Lord came upon him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 And he said, Thus says the Lord, Make this  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   brook.  </span>  valley full of trenches.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 For thus says the Lord, You° shall not see wind, neither shall you° see rain, yet this valley shall be filled with water, and you°, and your  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   posessions.  </span>  flocks, and your cattle shall drink.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 And this   is   a light   thing   in the eyes of the Lord: I will also deliver Moab  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in.  </span>  into your hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  019" id="3  019" >19</span>
 And you° shall strike every strong city, and you° shall  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   throw down.  </span>  cut down every good tree, and you° shall stop all wells of water, and spoil every good piece   of land   with stones.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  020" id="3  020" >20</span>
 And it came to pass in the morning, when the sacrifice was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   going up.  </span>  offered, that, behold! waters came from the way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  021" id="3  021" >21</span>
 And all Moab heard that the three kings were come up to fight against them; and they cried out  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from.  </span>  on every   side, even   all that were girded with a girdle,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.   καὶ ἐπάνα, 'and above.'  </span>  and they said, Ho! and stood upon the border.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  022" id="3  022" >22</span>
 And they rose early in the morning, and the sun rose upon the waters, and Moab saw the waters on the opposite side red as blood.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  023" id="3  023" >23</span>
 And they said, This   is   the blood of the sword; and the kings have fought, and each man has struck his neighbor; now then to the spoils, Moab.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  024" id="3  024" >24</span>
 And they entered into the camp of Israel; and Israel arose and struck Moab, and they fled from before them; and they  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   went in, going in and striking.  </span>  went on and struck Moab as they went.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  025" id="3  025" >25</span>
 And they razed the cities, and cast every man his stone on every good piece   of land   and filled it; and they stopped every well, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   threw down.  </span>  cut down every good tree, until they left   only   the stones of the wall cast down; and the slingers compassed   the land  , and struck it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  026" id="3  026" >26</span>
 And the king of Moab saw that the battle prevailed against him; and he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword, to cut through to the king of Edom: and they could not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0123  027" id="3  027" >27</span>
 And he took his oldest son whom he had designed to reign in his stead, and offered him up for a whole burnt offering on the walls. And there was a great  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   repentance.  </span>  indignation against Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to their land.

<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> And one of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried to Elisaie, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant feared the Lord: and the creditor is come to take my two sons to be his servants.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 And Elisaie said, What shall I do for you? tell me what you have in the house. And she said, Your servant has nothing in the house, except oil wherewith I  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   shall anoint.  </span>  anoint myself.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 And he said to her, Go, borrow for yourself vessels without of all your neighbors,   even   empty vessels; borrow not a few.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 And you shall go in and shut the door upon you and upon your sons, and you shall pour forth into these vessels, and remove that which is filled.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  005" id="4  005" >5</span>
 And she departed from him, and shut the door upon herself and upon her sons: they brought the vessels near to her, and she poured in until the vessels were filled.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 And she said to her sons, Bring me yet a vessel. And they said to her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 And she came and told the man of God: and Elisaie said, Go, and sell the oil, and you shall pay your  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   interest,   pl. </span>  debts, and you and your sons shall live of the remaining oil.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 And a day came, when Elisaie passed over to Soman, and   there was   a great lady there, and she constrained him to eat bread: and it came to pass as often as he went into   the city, that   he turned aside to eat there.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 And the woman said to her husband, See now, I know that this   is   a holy man of God who comes over continually to us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 Let us now make for him an upper chamber, a small place; and let us put there for him a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall come to pass that when he comes in to us, he shall  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   turn aside.  </span>  turn in there.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 And a day came, and he went in there, and turned aside into the upper chamber, and lay there.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 And he said to Giezi his servant, Call me this Somanite. and he called her, and she stood before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, you have  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   been astonished with all this astonishment.  </span>  taken all this trouble for us; what should I do for you? Hast you any  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   word   or   business.  </span>  request   to make   to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she said, I dwell in the midst of my people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  014" id="4  014" >14</span>
 And he said to Giezi, What must we do for her? and Giezi his servant said, Indeed she has no son, and her husband   is   old.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  015" id="4  015" >15</span>
 And he called her, and she stood by the door.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  016" id="4  016" >16</span>
 And Elisaie said to her, At this time   next year  , as the season   is  , you   shall be   alive, and embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, do not lie to your servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  017" id="4  017" >17</span>
 And the woman conceived, and bore a son at the very time, as the season was, being alive, as Elisaie said to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  018" id="4  018" >18</span>
 And the child grew: and it came to pass when he went out to his father to the reapers,  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  019" id="4  019" >19</span>
 that he said to his father, My head, my head. and   his father   said to a servant, carry him to his mother.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  020" id="4  020" >20</span>
 And he carried him to his mother, and he lay upon her knees till noon, and died.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  021" id="4  021" >21</span>
 And she carried him up and laid him on the bed of the man of god; and she shut the door upon him, and went out.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  022" id="4  022" >22</span>
 And she called her husband, and said, Send now for me one of the young men, and one of the asses, and I will  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   run.  </span>  ride quickly to the man of God, and return.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  023" id="4  023" >23</span>
 And he said, Why are you going to him today? It is neither new moon, nor the Sabbath. And she said,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   peace.  </span>    It is   well.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  024" id="4  024" >24</span>
 And she saddled the ass, and said to her servant, Be quick, proceed: spare not on my account to ride, unless I shall tell you. Go, and you shall proceed, and come to the man of God to mount Carmel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  025" id="4  025" >25</span>
 And she  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   went.  </span>  rode and came to the man of God to the mountain: and it came to pass when Elisaie saw her coming, that he said to Giezi his servant, See now, that Somanite comes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  026" id="4  026" >26</span>
 Now run to meet her, and you shall say,   Is it   well with you?  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   peace.  </span>    is it   well with your husband?   is it   well with the child? and she said,   It is   well.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  027" id="4  027" >27</span>
 And she came to Elisaie to the mountain, and laid hold of his feet; and Giezi drew near to thrust her away. And Elisaie said, Let her alone, for her soul   is   much grieved in her, and the Lord has hidden   it   from me, and has not told   it   me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  028" id="4  028" >28</span>
 And she said, Did I ask a son of my lord? For did I not say,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   You shall not.  </span>  Do not deal deceitfully with me?  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  029" id="4  029" >29</span>
 And Elisaie said to Giezi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go: if you meet any man, you shall not  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   bless.  </span>  salute him, and if a man salute you you shall not answer him: and you shall lay my staff on the child's face.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  030" id="4  030" >30</span>
 And the mother of the child said,   As   the Lord lives and   as   your soul lives, I will not leave you. And Elisaie arose, and went after her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  031" id="4  031" >31</span>
 And Giezi went on before her, and laid his staff on the child's face: but there was neither voice nor any hearing. So he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  032" id="4  032" >32</span>
 And Elisaie went into the house, and, behold, the dead child was laid upon his bed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  033" id="4  033" >33</span>
 And Elisaie went into the house, and shut the door upon themselves, the two, and prayed to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  034" id="4  034" >34</span>
 And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands; and bowed himself upon him, and the flesh of the child grew warm.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  035" id="4  035" >35</span>
 And he returned, and walked up and down in the house: and he went up, and bowed himself on the child seven times; and the child opened his eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  036" id="4  036" >36</span>
 And Elisaie cried out to Giezi, and said, Call this Somanite. So he called her, and she came in to him: and Elisaie said, Take your son.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  037" id="4  037" >37</span>
 And the woman went in, and fell at his feet, and did obeisance   bowing   to the ground; and she took her son, and went out.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  038" id="4  038" >38</span>
 And Elisaie returned to Galgala: and a famine   was   in the land; and the sons of the prophets sat before him: and Elisaie said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  039" id="4  039" >39</span>
 And he went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a vine in the field, and gathered of it wild  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. sing.   colosynth.  </span>  gourds, his garment full; and he cast it into the caldron of pottage, for they knew   them   not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  040" id="4  040" >40</span>
 And he poured it out for the men to eat: and it came to pass, when they were eating of the pottage, that behold! they cried out, and said,   There is   death in the pot, O man of God. And they could not eat.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  041" id="4  041" >41</span>
 And he said, Take meal, and cast it into the pot. And Elisaie said to his servant Giezi, Pour out for the people, and let them eat. And there was no longer there any hurtful thing in the pot.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  042" id="4  042" >42</span>
 And there came a man over from Baetharisa, and brought to the man of God twenty barley loaves and cakes of figs, of the first fruits. And he said, Give to the people, and let them eat.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  043" id="4  043" >43</span>
 And his servant said, Why should I set this before a hundred men? and he said, Give to the people, and let them eat; for thus says the Lord, They shall eat and leave.  <span class="verse" rel="v0124  044" id="4  044" >44</span>
 And they ate and left, according to the word of the Lord.

<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> Now Naiman, the captain of the host of Syria, was a great man before his master, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   wondered at in countenance.  </span>  highly respected, because by him the Lord had given deliverance to Syria, and the man was mighty in strength,   but   a leper.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 And the Syrians went forth  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   light armed, etc.  </span>  in small bands, and took captive out of the land of Israel a little maid: and she  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   was before.  </span>  waited on Naiman's wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 And she said to her mistress, O that my lord were before the prophet of God in Samaria; then he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   will detach him.  </span>  would recover him from his leprosy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 And she went in and told her lord, and said, Thus and thus spoke the maid from the land of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 And the king of Syria said to Naiman, Go to, go, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he went, and took in his hand ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   changing robes.  </span>  changes of raiment.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now then, as soon as this letter shall reach you, behold, I have sent to you my servant Naiman, and you shall recover him from his leprosy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 And it came to pass, when the king of Israel read the letter,   that   he tore his garments, and said,   Am   I God, to kill and to make alive, that this   man   sends to me to recover a man of his leprosy? consider, however, I pray you, and see that this   man   seeks an occasion against me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 And it came to pass, when Elisaie heard that the king of Israel had tore his garments, that he sent to the king of Israel, saying, Therefore have you tore your garments? Let Naiman, I pray you, come to me, and let him know that there is a prophet in Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 So Naiman came with horse and chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisaie.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 And Elisaie sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash seven times in Jordan, and your flesh shall return to you, and you shall be cleansed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  011" id="5  011" >11</span>
 And Naiman was angry, and departed, and said, Behold, I said, He will by all means come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of his God, and lay his hand upon the place, and recover the leper.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  012" id="5  012" >12</span>
    Are   not the Abana and Pharphar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   shall I not, etc.  </span>  may I not go and wash in them, and be cleansed? and he turned and went away in a rage.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  013" id="5  013" >13</span>
 And his servants came near and said to him,   Suppose   the prophet had spoken a great thing to you,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   will you.  </span>  would you not perform it? yet he has but said to you, Wash, and be cleansed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 So Naiman went down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the word of Elisaie: and his flesh returned to him as the flesh of a little child, and he was cleansed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  015" id="5  015" >15</span>
 And he and all his  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   army   or   camp.  </span>  company returned to Elisaie, and he came and stood before him, and said, Behold, I know that there is no God in all the earth, save only in Israel: and now receive a blessing of your servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  016" id="5  016" >16</span>
 And Elisaie said,   As   the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will not take   one  . And he pressed him to take   one  : but he would not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  017" id="5  017" >17</span>
 And Naiman said, Well then, if not, let there be given to your servant, I pray you, the load   of a   yoke of mules; and you shall give me of the red earth: for henceforth your servant will not offer whole burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but only to the Lord  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Probably this last clause belongs to   ver.   18.  </span>  by   reason of   this thing.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  018" id="5  018" >18</span>
 And  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   The Lord shall be, etc.  </span>  let the Lord be propitious to your servant when my master goes into the house of Remman to worship there, and he shall lean on my hand, and I shall bow down in the house of Remman when he bows down in the house of Remman; even let the Lord, I pray, be merciful to your servant in this matter.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  019" id="5  019" >19</span>
 And Elisaie said to Naiman, Go in peace. And he departed from him a little way.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  020" id="5  020" >20</span>
 And Giezi the servant of Elisaie said, Behold, my Lord has spared this Syrian Naiman, so as not to take of his hand what he has brought: as the Lord lives, I will surely run after him, and take somewhat of him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  021" id="5  021" >21</span>
 So Giezi followed after Naiman: and Naiman saw him running after him, and turned back from his chariot to meet him.  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.+   'Is all well?'  </span>   <span class="verse" rel="v0125  022" id="5  022" >22</span>
 And   Giezi   said, All is well: my master has sent me, saying, Behold, now are there come to me two young men of the sons of the prophets from mount Ephraim; give them, I pray you, a talent of silver, and two  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   changing robes.  </span>  changes of raiment.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  023" id="5  023" >23</span>
 And   Naiman   said, Take two talents of silver. And he took two talents of silver in two bags, and two changes of raiment, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   gave.  </span>  put them upon two of his servants, and they bore them before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  024" id="5  024" >24</span>
 And he came to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a dark place, or the dark.  </span>  a secret place, and took them from their hands, and laid them up in the house, and dismissed the men.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  025" id="5  025" >25</span>
 And he went in himself and stood before his master; and Elisaie said to him,  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  026" id="5  026" >26</span>
 Whence   come you  , Giezi? and Giezi said, Your servant has not been hither or there. And Elisaie said to him, Went not my heart with you, when the man returned from his chariot to meet you? and now you have received silver, and now you have received raiment, and olive yards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants.  <span class="verse" rel="v0125  027" id="5  027" >27</span>
 The leprosy also of Naiman shall cleave to you, and to your seed for ever. And he went out from his presence leprous, like snow.

<p><span class="chapter" id="6  001">6  </span> And the sons of the prophets said to Elisaie, Behold now, the place wherein we dwell before you is too narrow for us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  002" id="6  002" >2</span>
 Let us go, we pray you, to Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and make for ourselves a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a place of inhabiting.  </span>  habitation there.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  003" id="6  003" >3</span>
 And he said, Go. And one of them said gently, Come with your servants. And he said, I will go.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  004" id="6  004" >4</span>
 And he went with them, and they came to Jordan, and began to cut down  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   trees.  </span>  wood.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  005" id="6  005" >5</span>
 And behold, one was cutting down a beam, and the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   iron.  </span>  axe head fell into the water: and he cried out, Alas! master: and it was hidden.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  006" id="6  006" >6</span>
 And the man of God said, Where did it fall? and he showed him the place: and he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   pinched off with the nail, etc.  </span>  broke off a stick, and threw it in there, and the iron came to the surface.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  007" id="6  007" >7</span>
 And he said, Take it up to yourself. And he stretched out his hand, and took it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  008" id="6  008" >8</span>
 And the king of Syria was at war with Israel: and he consulted with his servants, saying, I will encamp in such a place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  009" id="6  009" >9</span>
 And Elisaie sent to the king of Israel, saying, Take heed that you pass not by  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   this.  </span>  that place, for the Syrians are hidden there.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  010" id="6  010" >10</span>
 And the king of Israel sent to the place which Elisaie mentioned to him, and saved himself thence not once or twice.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  011" id="6  011" >11</span>
 And the mind of the king of Syria was very much disturbed concerning this thing; and he called his servants, and said to them, Will you° not tell me who betrays me to the king of Israel?  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  012" id="6  012" >12</span>
 And one of his servants said, Nay, my Lord, O king, for Elisaie the prophet that is in Israel reports to the king of Israel all the words whatever you may say in  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   closet of your bedchamber.  </span>  your bedchamber.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  013" id="6  013" >13</span>
 And he said, Go, see where this man   is  , and I will send and take him. And they sent word to him, saying, Behold,   he is   in Dothaim.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  014" id="6  014" >14</span>
 And he sent there horses, and chariots, and a mighty host: and they came by night, and compassed about the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  015" id="6  015" >15</span>
 And the servant of Elisaie  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   was early to rise.  </span>  rose up early and went out; and, behold, a host compassed the city, and horses and chariots: and the servant said to him, O master,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   how shall we do?  </span>  what shall we do?  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  016" id="6  016" >16</span>
 And Elisaie said, Fear not, for they who are with us   are   more than they that are with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  017" id="6  017" >17</span>
 And Elisaie prayed, and said, Lord, open, I pray you, the eyes of the servant, and let him see. And the Lord opened his eyes, and he saw: and, behold, the mountain   was   full of horses, and there were chariots of fire round about Elisaie.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  018" id="6  018" >18</span>
 And they came down to him; and he prayed to the Lord, and said, Strike, I pray you, this  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   nation.  </span>  people with blindness. And he struck them with blindness, according to the word of Elisaie.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  019" id="6  019" >19</span>
 And Elisaie said to them, This   is   not the city, and this   is   not the way: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you° seek. And he led them away to Samaria.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  020" id="6  020" >20</span>
 And it came to pass when they entered into Samaria, that Elisaie said, Open, I pray you, O Lord, their eyes, and let them see. And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  021" id="6  021" >21</span>
 And the king of Israel said to Elisaie, when he saw them, Shall I   not   verily strike them,   my   father?  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  022" id="6  022" >22</span>
 And he said, You shall not strike them, unless you  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   smite.  </span>  would strike those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow: set bread and water before them, and let them eat and drink, and depart to their master.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  023" id="6  023" >23</span>
 And he set before them a great feast, and they ate and drank: and he dismissed them and they departed to their master. And the bands of Syria came no longer into the land of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  024" id="6  024" >24</span>
 And it came to pass after this, that the son of Ader king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up, and besieged Samaria.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  025" id="6  025" >25</span>
 And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was   valued   at fifty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung at five pieces of silver.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  026" id="6  026" >26</span>
 And the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, and a woman cried to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  027" id="6  027" >27</span>
 And he said to her, Unless the Lord help you, whence shall I help you? from the corn-floor, or from the wine-press?  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  028" id="6  028" >28</span>
 And the king said to her, What is   the matter   with you? And the woman said to him, This   woman   said to me, Give your son, and we will eat him today, and we will eat my son to-morrow.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  029" id="6  029" >29</span>
 So we boiled my son, and ate him; and I said to her on the second day, Give your son, and let us eat him: and she has hidden her son.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  030" id="6  030" >30</span>
 And it came to pass, when the king of Israel heard the words of the woman,   that   he tore his garments; and he passed by on the wall, and the people saw sackcloth within upon his flesh.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  031" id="6  031" >31</span>
 And he said, God  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   do these things to me and add these things.  </span>  do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisaie shall stand upon him this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  032" id="6  032" >32</span>
 And Elisaie was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him; and   the king   sent a man before him: before the messenger came to him, he also said to the elders, Do you° see that this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? See, as soon as the messenger shall have come, shut the door, and forcibly detain him at the door:   is   not the sound of his master's feet behind him?  <span class="verse" rel="v0126  033" id="6  033" >33</span>
 While he was yet speaking with them, behold, a messenger came to him: and he said, Behold, this evil   is   of the Lord; why should I wait for the Lord any longer?  
<!-- 7   033 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="7  001">7  </span> And Elisaie said, Hear you the word of the Lord; Thus says the Lord,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   As is this, etc.  </span>  As at this time, to-morrow a measure of fine flour   shall be sold   for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gates of Samaria.  <span class="verse" rel="v0127  002" id="7  002" >2</span>
 And the officer on whose hand the king rested, answered Elisaie, and said, Behold,   if   the Lord shall make flood-gates in heaven,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   shall.  </span>  might this thing be? and Elisaie said, Behold, you shall see with your eyes, but shall not eat thereof.  <span class="verse" rel="v0127  003" id="7  003" >3</span>
 And there were four leprous men by the gate of the city: and one said to his neighbor, Why sit we here until we die?  <span class="verse" rel="v0127  004" id="7  004" >4</span>
 If we should say, Let us go into the city, then   there is   famine in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit here, then we shall die. Now then come, and let us fall upon the camp of the Syrians: if they should take us alive, then we shall live; and if they should put us to death, then we shall   only   die.  <span class="verse" rel="v0127  005" id="7  005" >5</span>
 And they rose up  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in the dark.  </span>  while it was yet night, to go into the camp of Syria; and they came into a part of the camp of Syria, and behold, there  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   is.  </span>    was   no man there.  <span class="verse" rel="v0127  006" id="7  006" >6</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and.  </span>  For the Lord had made the army of Syria to hear a sound of chariots, and a sound of horses,   even   the sound of a great host: and   each   man said to his fellow, Now has the king of Israel hired against us the kings of the Chettites, and the kings of Egypt, to come against us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0127  007" id="7  007" >7</span>
 And they arose and fled while it was yet dark, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses in the camp,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   as it is.  </span>  as they were, and fled  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to their life.  </span>  for their lives.  <span class="verse" rel="v0127  008" id="7  008" >8</span>
 And these lepers entered a little way into the camp, and went into one tent, and ate and drank, and took thence silver, and gold, and raiment; and they went and returned thence, and entered into another tent, and took thence, and went and hid   the spoil  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0127  009" id="7  009" >9</span>
 And   one   man said to his neighbor, We are not doing   well   thus: this day is a day of glad tidings, and we hold our peace, and are waiting till the morning light, and shall find mischief: now them come, and let us go into   the city  , and report to the house of the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0127  010" id="7  010" >10</span>
 So they  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   went in.  </span>  went and cried toward the gate of the city, and reported to them, saying, We went into the camp of Syria, and, behold, there is not there a man, nor voice of man, only  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   horse.  </span>  horses tied and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   ass.  </span>  asses, and their tents as they were.  <span class="verse" rel="v0127  011" id="7  011" >11</span>
 And the porters cried aloud, and reported to the house of the king within.  <span class="verse" rel="v0127  012" id="7  012" >12</span>
 And the king rose up by night, and said to his servants, I will now tell you what  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   Syria.  </span>  the Syrians have done to us. They knew that we are hungry; and they have gone forth from the camp and hidden themselves in the field, saying, They will come out of the city, and we shall catch them alive, and go into the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0127  013" id="7  013" >13</span>
 And one of his servants answered and said, Let them now take five of the horses that were left, which were left here; behold, they are the number left to all the multitude of Israel; and we will send there and see.  <span class="verse" rel="v0127  014" id="7  014" >14</span>
 So they took two horsemen; and the king of Israel sent after the king of Syria, saying, Go, and see.  <span class="verse" rel="v0127  015" id="7  015" >15</span>
 And they went after them even to Jordan: and, behold, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their panic. and the messengers returned, and brought word to the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0127  016" id="7  016" >16</span>
 And the people went out, and plundered the camp of Syria: and a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord, and two measures of barley for a shekel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0127  017" id="7  017" >17</span>
 And the king appointed the officer on whose hand the king leaned   to have charge   over the gate: and the people trampled on him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God   had   said, who spoke when the messenger came down to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0127  018" id="7  018" >18</span>
 So it came to pass as Elisaie had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley   shall be sold   for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel; and it shall be  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   as this time is.  </span>  as at this time to-morrow in the gate of Samaria.  <span class="verse" rel="v0127  019" id="7  019" >19</span>
 And the officer answered Elisaie, and said, Behold,   if   the Lord makes flood-gates in heaven, shall this thing be? and Elisaie said, Behold, you shall see   it   with your eyes, but you shall not eat thereof.  <span class="verse" rel="v0127  020" id="7  020" >20</span>
 And it was so: for the people trampled on him in the gate, and he died.  
<!-- 8   020 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> And Elisaie spoke to the woman, whose son he   had    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The   Gr.   signifies, to rekindle a fire.  </span>  restored to life, saying, Arise, and go you and your house, and sojourn wherever you may sojourn: for the Lord has called for a famine upon the land; indeed it is come upon the land   for   seven years.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 And the woman arose, and did according to the word of Elisaie, both she and her house; and they sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 And it came to pass after the expiration of the seven years, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines to the city; and came to cry to the king for her house and for her lands.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  004" id="8  004" >4</span>
 And the king spoke to Giezi the servant of Elisaie the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray you, all the great things which Elisaie has done.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life the dead son, behold, the woman whose son Elisaie restored to life   came   crying to the king for her house and for her lands. And Giezi said, My lord, O king, this   is   the woman, and this   is   her son, whom Elisaie restored to life.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 And the king asked the woman, and she told him: and the king appointed her a eunuch, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field from the day that she left the land until now.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  007" id="8  007" >7</span>
 And Elisaie came to Damascus; and the king of Syria the son of Ader was ill, and they brought him word, saying, The man of God is come here.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  008" id="8  008" >8</span>
 And the king said to Azael, Take in your hand  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The   Gr.   retains the   Heb. word.  </span>  a present, and go to meet the man of God, and enquire of the Lord by him, saying, Shall I  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   live?  </span>  recover of this my disease?  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 And Azael went to meet him, and he took a present in his hand, and all the good things of Damascus, forty camels' load, and came and stood before him, and said to Elisaie, Your son the son of Ader, the king of Syria, has sent me to you to enquire, saying, Shall I recover of this my disease?  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 And Elisaie said, Go, say, You shall certainly live; yet the Lord has showed me that  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Complut.   and   Ald.   ἀποθανεῖται.  </span>  you shall surely die.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  011" id="8  011" >11</span>
 And he stood before him, and fixed   his countenance   till he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  012" id="8  012" >12</span>
 And Azael said, Why does my lord weep? And he said, Because I know all the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: you will  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   send away.  </span>  utterly destroy their strong holds with fire, and you will kill their choice men with the sword, and you will dash their infants   against the ground  , and their women with child you will rip up.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 And Azael said, Who is your servant? a dead dog, that he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   shall.  </span>  should do this thing? And Elisaie said, The Lord has shown me you ruling over Syria.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 And he departed from Elisaie, and went in to his lord; and he said to him, What said Elisaie to you? and he said, He said to me, You shall surely live.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  015" id="8  015" >15</span>
 And it came to pass on the next day that he took a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The   Gr.   is from the   Heb. rug   or   quilt, etc.  </span>  thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and put it on his face, and he died: and Azael reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  016" id="8  016" >16</span>
 In the fifth year  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to.  </span>  of Joram son of Achaab king of Israel, and while Josaphat was king of Juda, Joram the son of Josaphat king of Juda  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   reigned.  </span>  began to reign.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  017" id="8  017" >17</span>

 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Achaab; for the daughter of Achaab was his wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  019" id="8  019" >19</span>
 But the Lord would not destroy Juda for David his servant's sake, as he said he would give a light to him and to his sons continually.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  020" id="8  020" >20</span>
 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Juda, and they made a king over  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   himself.  </span>  themselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  021" id="8  021" >21</span>
 And Joram went up to Sior, and all the chariots that were with him: and it came to pass after he had arisen, that he struck Edom who compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  022" id="8  022" >22</span>
 Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Juda till this day. Then Lobna revolted at that time.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  023" id="8  023" >23</span>
 And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  024" id="8  024" >24</span>
 So Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of his father David: and Ochozias his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  025" id="8  025" >25</span>

 And he walked in the way of the house of Achaab, and did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as did the house of Achaab.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  028" id="8  028" >28</span>
 And he went with Joram the son of Achaab to war  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   with.  </span>  against Azael king of  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The   Gr.   word ἀλλοφύλοι is almost always applied elsewhere to the Philistines.  </span>  the Syrians in Remmoth Galaad; and the Syrians wounded Joram.  <span class="verse" rel="v0128  029" id="8  029" >29</span>
 And king Joram returned to be healed in Jezrael of the wounds with which they wounded him in Remmoth, when he fought with Azael king of Syria. And Ochozias son of Joram went down to see Joram the son of Achaab in Jezrael, because he was sick.

<p><span class="chapter" id="9  001">9  </span> And Elisaie the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, Gird up your loins, and take this cruse of oil in your hand, and go to Remmoth Galaad.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  002" id="9  002" >2</span>
 And you shall enter there, and shall see there Ju the son of Josaphat son of Namessi, and shall go in and make him rise up from among his brethren, and shall bring him into a secret chamber.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  003" id="9  003" >3</span>
 And you shall take the cruse of oil, and pour   it   on his head, and say you, Thus says the Lord, I have anointed you king over Israel: and you shall open the door, and flee, and not wait.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  004" id="9  004" >4</span>
 And the young man the prophet went to Remmoth Galaad.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  005" id="9  005" >5</span>
 And he went in, and, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have a message to you, O captain. And Ju said, To which of all us? And he said, To you, O captain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
 And he arose, and went into the house: and he poured the oil upon his head, and said to him, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, I have anointed you to be king over the people of the Lord, even over Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 And you shall utterly destroy the house of Achaab your master from before me, and shall avenge the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   bloods.  </span>  blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord, at the hand of Jezabel,  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 and at the hand of the whole house of Achaab: and you shall utterly cut off from the house of Achaab every male, and him that is shut up and left in Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 And I will  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   give.  </span>  make the house of Achaab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and as the house of Baasa the son of Achia.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  010" id="9  010" >10</span>

And he opened the door, and fled.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  011" id="9  011" >11</span>
 And Ju went forth to the servants of his lord, and they said to him,   Is    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   peace.  </span>  all well? Why came this mad fellow in to you? And he said to them, You° know the man, and his communication.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  012" id="9  012" >12</span>
 And they said,   It is   wrong: tell us now. And Ju said to them, Thus and thus spoke he to me, saying, —and he said, Thus says the Lord, I have anointed you to be king over Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  013" id="9  013" >13</span>
 And when they heard it, they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. word in   Gr. </span>  top of the stairs, and blew with the trumpet, and said, Ju  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   has reigned.  </span>  is king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  014" id="9  014" >14</span>
 So Ju the son of Josaphat the son of Namessi conspired against Joram, and Joram was defending Remmoth Galaad, he and all Israel,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from the face of.  </span>  because of Azael king of Syria.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  015" id="9  015" >15</span>
 And king Joram had returned to be healed in Jezrael of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, in his war with Azael king of Syria.  
<!-- 9   015 -->


<p> And Ju said, If your heart is with me, let there not go forth out of the city  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   one having escaped.  </span>  one fugitive to go and report to Jezrael.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  016" id="9  016" >16</span>
 And Ju rode and advanced, and came down to Jezrael; for Joram king of Israel was getting healed in Jezrael of the arrow-wounds wherewith the Syrians   had   wounded him in Rammath in the war with Azael king of Syria; for he   was   strong and a mighty man: and Ochozias king of Juda was come down to see Joram.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  017" id="9  017" >17</span>
 And there went up a watchman upon the tower of Jezrael, and saw the dust   made by   Ju as he approached; and he said, I see dust. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   before them.  </span>  to meet them, and let him say, Peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  018" id="9  018" >18</span>
 And there went a horseman to meet them, and said, Thus says the king, Peace. And Ju said, What have you to do with peace? turn behind me. And the watchman reported, saying, The messenger came up to them, and has not returned.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  019" id="9  019" >19</span>
 And he sent another horseman, and he came to him, and said, Thus says the king, Peace. And Ju said, What have you to do with peace? turn behind me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  020" id="9  020" >20</span>
 And the watchman reported, saying, He came up to them, and has not returned: and the driver  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   has driven.  </span>  drives Ju the son of Namessi, for it is with furious   haste  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  021" id="9  021" >21</span>
 And Joram said, Make ready. And one made ready the chariot: and Joram the king of Israel went forth, and Ochozias king of Juda, each in his chariot, and they went to meet Ju, and found him in the portion of Nabuthai the Jezraelite.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  022" id="9  022" >22</span>
 And it came to pass when Joram saw Ju, that he said,   Is it   peace, Ju? And Ju said, How   can it be   peace? as yet   there are   the whoredoms of your mother Jezabel, and her abundant witchcrafts.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  023" id="9  023" >23</span>
 And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ochozias, Treachery, Ochozias.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  024" id="9  024" >24</span>
 And Ju  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   filled his hand with the bow.  </span>  bent his bow with his full strength, and struck Joram between his arms, and his arrow went out at his heart, and he bowed upon his knees.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  025" id="9  025" >25</span>
 And   Ju   said to Badecar his chief officer, Cast him into the portion of ground of Nabuthai the Jezraelite, for I and you remember, riding   as we were    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   on yokes,   or   chariots with pairs of horses.  </span>  on chariots after Achaab his father,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and the Lord.  </span>  that the Lord took up this burden against him,   saying  ,  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  026" id="9  026" >26</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.

Now then, I pray you, take him up and cast him into the portion, according to the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  027" id="9  027" >27</span>
 And Ochozias king of Juda saw   it  , and fled by the way of  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. the garden house.  </span>  Baethgan. And Ju pursued after him, and said,   Slay   him also. And one struck him in the chariot at the going up of Gai, which is Jeblaam: and he fled to Mageddo, and died there.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  028" id="9  028" >28</span>
 And his servants put him on a chariot, and brought him to Jerusalem, and they buried him in his sepulchre in the city of David.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  029" id="9  029" >29</span>
 And in the eleventh year of Joram king of Israel, Ochozias began to reign over Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  030" id="9  030" >30</span>
 And Ju came to Jezrael; and Jezabel heard   of it  , and coloured her eyes, and adorned her head, and looked through the window.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  031" id="9  031" >31</span>
 And Ju entered into the city; and she said, Had Zambri, the murderer of his master, peace?  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  032" id="9  032" >32</span>
 And he lifted up his face toward the window, and saw her, and said, Who are you? Come down with me. And two eunuchs looked down towards him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  033" id="9  033" >33</span>
 And he said, Throw her   down  . And they threw her   down  ; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and they trampled on her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  034" id="9  034" >34</span>
 And   Ju   went in and ate and drank, and said, Look now, after this cursed woman, and bury her, for she is a king's daughter.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  035" id="9  035" >35</span>
 And they went to bury her; but they found nothing of her but the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  036" id="9  036" >36</span>
 And they returned and told him. And he said,   It is   the word of the Lord, which he spoke by the hand of Eliu the Thesbite, saying, In the portion of Jezrael shall the dogs eat the flesh of Jezabel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0129  037" id="9  037" >37</span>
 And the carcass of Jezabel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezrael, so that they shall not say,   This is   Jezabel.

<p><span class="chapter" id="10  001">10  </span> And Achaab   had   seventy sons in Samaria. And Ju wrote a letter, and sent it into Samaria to the rulers of Samaria, and to the elders, and to the guardians of   the children of   Achaab, saying.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  002" id="10  002" >2</span>
 Now then, as soon as this letter shall have reached you, whereas   there are   with you the sons of your master, and with you  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the chariot and the horses.  </span>  chariots and horses, and strong cities, and arms,  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  003" id="10  003" >3</span>
 do you° accordingly look out the best and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   upright,   q.d.   unblemished  </span>  fit among your master's sons, and set him on the throne of his father, and fight for the house of your master.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  004" id="10  004" >4</span>
 And they feared greatly, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: and how shall we stand?  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  005" id="10  005" >5</span>
 So they that were over the house, and they that were over the city, and the elders and the guardians, sent to Ju, saying, We also   are   your servants, and whatever you shall say to us we will do; we will not make   any   man king: we will do that which is right in your eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  006" id="10  006" >6</span>
 And Ju wrote them a second letter, saying, If you°   are   for me, and listen to my voice, take the heads of the men your master's sons, and bring   them   to me at this time to-morrow in Jezrael. Now the sons of the king were seventy men; these great men of the city brought them up.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  007" id="10  007" >7</span>
 And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and killed them,   even   seventy men, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him at Jezrael.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  008" id="10  008" >8</span>
 And a messenger came and told   him  , saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay them   in   two heaps by the door of the gate until the morning.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  009" id="10  009" >9</span>
 And the morning came, and he went forth, and stood, and said to all the people, You° are righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and killed him: but who killed all these?  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  010" id="10  010" >10</span>
 See now that there shall not fall to the ground anything of the word of the Lord which the Lord spoke against the house of Achaab: for the Lord has performed all that he spoke of by the hand of his servant Eliu.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  011" id="10  011" >11</span>
 And Ju struck all that were left of the house of Achaab in Jezrael, and all his great men, and his acquaintance, and his priests, so as not to leave him   any   remnant.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  012" id="10  012" >12</span>
 And he arose and went to Samaria,   and   he   was   in the house of sheep-shearing in the way.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  013" id="10  013" >13</span>
 And Ju found the brethren of Ochozias king of Juda, and said, Who   are   you°? And they said, We   are   the brethren of Ochozias, and we have come down to salute the sons of the king, and the sons of the queen.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  014" id="10  014" >14</span>
 And he said, Take them alive. And they killed them at the shearing-house, forty and two men: he left not a man of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  015" id="10  015" >15</span>
 And he went thence and found Jonadab the son of Rechab   coming   to meet him; and he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   blessed him.  </span>  saluted him, and Ju said to him, Is your heart right with my heart, as my heart   is   with your heart? And Jonadab said, It is. And Ju said, If it is then, give me your hand. And he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   upon.  </span>  into the chariot.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  016" id="10  016" >16</span>
 And he said to him, Come with me, and see me zealous for the Lord. And he caused him to sit in his chariot.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  017" id="10  017" >17</span>
 And he entered into Samaria, and struck all that were left of Achaab in Samaria, until he had utterly destroyed him, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke to Eliu.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  018" id="10  018" >18</span>
 And Ju gathered all the people, and said to them, Achaab served Baal a little; Ju shall serve him much.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  019" id="10  019" >19</span>
 Now then do all   you°   the prophets of Baal call all his servants and his priests to me; let not a man be lacking: for I have a great sacrifice   to offer   to Baal; every one who shall be missing shall die. But Ju did it in subtilty, that he might destroy the servants of Baal.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  020" id="10  020" >20</span>
 And Ju said, Sanctify a solemn festival to Baal, and they made a proclamation.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  021" id="10  021" >21</span>
 And Ju sent throughout all Israel, saying, Now then let all   Baal's   servants, and all his priests, and all his prophets   come  , let none be lacking: for I am  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   offering.  </span>  going to offer a great sacrifice; whoever shall be missing, shall not live. So all the servants of Baal came, and all his priests, and all his prophets: there was not one left who came not. And they entered into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   mouth to mouth.  </span>  from one end to the other.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  022" id="10  022" >22</span>
 And he said to the man who was over the house of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The   Gr.   is from the   Hebrew   word.  </span>  wardrobe, Bring forth a robe for all the servants of Baal. And the keeper of the robes brought forth to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  023" id="10  023" >23</span>
 And Ju and Jonadab the son of Rechab entered into the house of Baal, and said to the servants of Baal, Search, and see whether there is among you any of the servants of the Lord, or only the servants of Baal, by themselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  024" id="10  024" >24</span>
 And he went in to offer sacrifices and whole burnt offerings; and Ju set for himself eighty men without, and said, Every man who shall escape of the men whom I bring into your hand, the life of him   that spares him   shall go for his life.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  025" id="10  025" >25</span>
 And it came to pass, when he had finished offering the whole burnt offering, that Ju said to the footmen and to the officers, Go you° in and kill them; let not a man of them escape. So they struck them with the edge of the sword, and the footmen and the officers cast   the bodies   forth, and went to the city of the house of Baal.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  026" id="10  026" >26</span>
 And they brought out the pillar of Baal, and burnt it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  027" id="10  027" >27</span>
 And they tore down the pillars of Baal, and made  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   him.  </span>  his house a draught-house until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  028" id="10  028" >28</span>
 So Ju abolished Baal out of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  029" id="10  029" >29</span>
 Nevertheless Ju departed not from following the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin:   these were   the golden heifers in Baethel and in Dan.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  030" id="10  030" >30</span>
 And the Lord said to Ju, Because of all your deeds wherein you have acted well in doing that which was right in my eyes, according to all things which you have done to the house of Achaab   as they were   in my heart, your sons to the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  031" id="10  031" >31</span>
 But Ju took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart: he departed not from following the sins of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  032" id="10  032" >32</span>
 In those days the Lord began to cut  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in Israel.   Hebraism. </span>  Israel short; and Azael struck them in every coast of Israel;  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  033" id="10  033" >33</span>
 from Jordan eastward all the land of Galaad belonging to the Gadites, of Gaddi and that of Ruben, and of Manasses, from Aroer, which is on the brink of the brook of Arnon, and Galaad and Basan.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  034" id="10  034" >34</span>
 And the rest of the acts of Ju, and all that he did, and all his might, and the wars wherein he engaged,   are   not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  035" id="10  035" >35</span>
 And Ju slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joachaz his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01210  036" id="10  036" >36</span>
 And the days which Ju reigned over Israel   were   twenty-eight years in Samaria.

 And in the seventh year Jodae sent and took the captains of hundreds of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. guards.  </span>  Chorri and of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. runners.  </span>  Rhasim, and brought them to him into the house of the Lord, and made a covenant of the Lord with them, and adjured them, and Jodae showed them the king's son.  <span class="verse" rel="v01211  005" id="11  005" >5</span>
 And charged them, saying, This   is   the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   word.  </span>  thing which you° shall do.  <span class="verse" rel="v01211  006" id="11  006" >6</span>
 Let a third part of you go in   on   the sabbath-day, and keep you° the watch of the king's house in the porch; and another third in the gate of the high way, and a third at the gate behind the footmen; and keep you° the guard of the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01211  007" id="11  007" >7</span>
 And there   shall be   two parties among you, even every one that goes out on the Sabbath, and they shall keep the guard of the Lord's house before the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01211  008" id="11  008" >8</span>
 And do you° compass the king about every man with his weapon in his hand, and he that goes into the ranges shall die: and they shall be with the king in his going out and in his coming in.  <span class="verse" rel="v01211  009" id="11  009" >9</span>
 And the captains of hundreds did all things that the wise Jodae commanded; and they took each his men, both those that went in on the sabbath-day,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   hands.  </span>  and those that went out on the sabbath-day, and went in to Jodae the priest.  <span class="verse" rel="v01211  010" id="11  010" >10</span>
 And the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the swords and spears of king David that were in the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01211  011" id="11  011" >11</span>
 And the footmen stood each  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and his weapon.  </span>  with his weapon in his hand from the right corner of the house to the left corner of the house,   by   the altar and the house round about the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01211  012" id="11  012" >12</span>
 And he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   sent forth.  </span>  brought forth the king's son, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   gave.  </span>  put upon him the crown and   gave him   the testimony; and he made him king, and anointed him: and they clapped   their   hands, and said, Long live the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01211  013" id="11  013" >13</span>
 And Gotholia heard the sound of the people running, and she went in to the people to the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01211  014" id="11  014" >14</span>
 And she looked, and, behold, the king stood near a pillar according to the manner; and the singers and the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   trumpets.  </span>  trumpeters were before the king and all the people of the land   even   rejoicing and sounding with trumpets: and Gotholia tore her garments, and cried, A conspiracy, a conspiracy.  <span class="verse" rel="v01211  015" id="11  015" >15</span>
 And Jodae the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were over the host, and said to them, Bring her forth without the ranges,   and   he that goes in after her shall certainly die by the sword. For the priest said, Let her not however be slain in the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01211  016" id="11  016" >16</span>
 And they laid hands upon her, and went in by the way of the horses' entrance into the house of the Lord, and she was slain there.  <span class="verse" rel="v01211  017" id="11  017" >17</span>
 And Jodae made a covenant between the Lord and the king and the people, that they should be the Lord's people; also between the king and the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01211  018" id="11  018" >18</span>
 And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and tore it down, and completely broke in pieces his altars and his images, and they killed Mathan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   placed.

 And he took the captains of the hundreds, and the Chorri, and the Rhasim, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king out of the house of the Lord; and they went in by the way of the gate of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   guard,   A.V. </span>  footmen of the king's house, and seated him there on the throne of the kings.  <span class="verse" rel="v01211  020" id="11  020" >20</span>
 And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was at rest: and they killed Gotholia with the sword in the house of the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01211  021" id="11  021" >21</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="12  001">12  </span> Joas  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   reigned.  </span>  began to reign in the seventh year of Ju, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name   was   Sabia of Bersabee.  <span class="verse" rel="v01212  002" id="12  002" >2</span>
 And Joas did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all the days that Jodae the priest instructed him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01212  003" id="12  003" >3</span>
 Only there were not   any   of the high places removed, and the people still sacrificed there, and burned incense on the high places.  <span class="verse" rel="v01212  004" id="12  004" >4</span>
 And Joas said to the priests,   As for   all the money of the holy things that is brought into the house of the Lord, the money of valuation,   as   each man brings the money of valuation, all the money which  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   it may come into the heart, etc.  </span>  any man may feel disposed to bring into the house of the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v01212  005" id="12  005" >5</span>
 let the priests take it to themselves, every man from   the proceeds of   his sale: and they shall repair the breaches of the house in all   places   wherever a breach shall be found.  <span class="verse" rel="v01212  006" id="12  006" >6</span>
 And it came to pass in the twenty-third year of king Joas the priests   had   not repaired the breaches of the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01212  007" id="12  007" >7</span>
 And king Joas called Jodae the priest, and the   other   priests, and said to them, Why have you° not repaired the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   breach.  </span>  breaches of the house? now then receive no   more   money from your sales, for you° shall give it to   repair the   breaches of the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01212  008" id="12  008" >8</span>
 And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, and not to repair the breaches of the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01212  009" id="12  009" >9</span>
 And Jodae the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it by the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The   Gr.   is a Hebrew word in Greek letters.  </span>  altar in the house of a man   belonging to   the house of the Lord, and the priests that kept the door put   therein   all the money that was found in the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01212  010" id="12  010" >10</span>
 And it came to pass, when they saw that   there was   much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest went up, and they tied up and counted the money that was found in the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01212  011" id="12  011" >11</span>

 Also they took no account of the men into whose hands they gave the money to give to the workmen, for they  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. באמכה הס.  </span>  acted faithfully.  <span class="verse" rel="v01212  016" id="12  016" >16</span>

 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked after the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin; he departed not from  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   it.  </span>  them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  003" id="13  003" >3</span>
 And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and delivered them into the hand of Azael king of Syria, and into the hand of the son of Ader son of Azael, all their days.  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  004" id="13  004" >4</span>
 And Joachaz implored the Lord, and the Lord listened to him, for he saw the affliction of Israel, because the king of Syria afflicted them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  005" id="13  005" >5</span>
 And the Lord gave deliverance to Israel, and they escaped from under the hand of Syria: and the children of Israel lived in their tents as  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   yesterday and today.  </span>  heretofore.  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  006" id="13  006" >6</span>

 Whereas there was not left any  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   people.  </span>  army to Joachaz, except fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand infantry: for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and they made them as dust for trampling.  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  008" id="13  008" >8</span>
 And the rest of the acts of Joachaz, and all that he did, and his mighty acts   are   not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  009" id="13  009" >9</span>
 And Joachaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria: and Joas his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  010" id="13  010" >10</span>
 In the thirty-seventh year of Joas king of Juda, Joas the son of Joachaz  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   reigned.  </span>  began to reign over Israel in Samaria sixteen years.  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  011" id="13  011" >11</span>
 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord; he departed not from all the sin of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin: he walked in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  012" id="13  012" >12</span>
 And the rest of the acts of Joas, and all that he did, and his mighty acts which he performed together with Amessias king of Juda,   are   not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  013" id="13  013" >13</span>
 And Joas slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat upon his throne, and he was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  014" id="13  014" >14</span>
 Now Elisaie was sick of his sickness, whereof he died: and Joas king of Israel went down to him, and wept over his face, and said,   My   father,   my   father, the chariot of Israel, and the horseman thereof!  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  015" id="13  015" >15</span>
 And Elisaie said to him, Take bow and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   weapons.  </span>  arrows. And he took to himself a bow and arrows.  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  016" id="13  016" >16</span>
 And he said to the king, Put your hand on the bow. And Joas put his hand upon   it  : and Elisaie put his hands upon the king's hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  017" id="13  017" >17</span>
 And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. And Elisaie said, Shoot. And he shot. And   Elisaie   said, The arrow of the Lord's deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in.  </span>  from Syria; and you shall strike the Syrians in Aphec until you have consumed them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  018" id="13  018" >18</span>
 And Elisaie said to him, Take bow and arrows. And he took them. And   he   said to the king of Israel, Strike upon the ground. And the king struck three times, and stayed.  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  019" id="13  019" >19</span>
 And the man of God was grieved at him, and said, If you had struck five or six times, then you should have struck Syria till you had consumed them; but now you shall strike Syria   only   thrice.  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  020" id="13  020" >20</span>
 And Elisaie died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites came into the land,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the year having come.  </span>  at the beginning of the year.  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  021" id="13  021" >21</span>
 And it came to pass as they were burying a man, that behold, they saw a band   of men  , and they cast the man into the grave of Elisaie: and as soon as he touched the bones of Elisaie, he revived and stood up on his feet.  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  022" id="13  022" >22</span>
 And Azael greatly afflicted Israel all the days of Joachaz.  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  023" id="13  023" >23</span>
 And the Lord had mercy and compassion upon them, and had respect to them because of his covenant with Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob; and the Lord would not destroy them, and did not cast them out from his presence.  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  024" id="13  024" >24</span>
 And Azael king of Syria died, and the son of Ader his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01213  025" id="13  025" >25</span>
 And Joas the son of Joachaz returned, and took the cities out of the hand of the son of Ader the son of Azael, which he had taken out of the hand of Joachaz his father in the war: thrice did Joas strike him, and he recovered the cities of Israel.

 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not as David his father: he did according to all things that his father Joas did.  <span class="verse" rel="v01214  004" id="14  004" >4</span>
 Only he removed not the high places: as yet the people sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places.  <span class="verse" rel="v01214  005" id="14  005" >5</span>
 And it came to pass when the kingdom was established in his hand, that he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   struck.  </span>  killed his servants that had  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   struck.  </span>  slain the king his father.  <span class="verse" rel="v01214  006" id="14  006" >6</span>
 But he killed not the sons of those that had slain him; according as it is written in the book of the laws of Moses, as the Lord gave commandment, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, and the children shall not be put to death for the fathers; but every one  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or.   be put to death, etc.  </span>  shall die for his own sins.  <span class="verse" rel="v01214  007" id="14  007" >7</span>

 Then Amessias sent messengers to Joas son of Joachaz son of Ju king of Israel, saying, Come, let us  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   appear to faces.  </span>  look one another in the face.  <span class="verse" rel="v01214  009" id="14  009" >9</span>
 And Joas the king of Israel sent to Amessias king of Juda, saying, The thistle that was in Libanus sent to the cedar that was in Libanus, saying, Give my daughter to your son to wife: and the wild beasts of the field that were in Libanus passed by and trod down the thistle.  <span class="verse" rel="v01214  010" id="14  010" >10</span>

 Twenty years old was Achaz when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not that which was right in the eyes of the Lord his God faithfully, as David his father   had done  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01216  003" id="16  003" >3</span>
 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yes, he made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01216  004" id="16  004" >4</span>

 And king Achaz charged Urias the priest, saying, Offer upon the great altar the whole burnt offering in the morning and the meat-offering in the evening, and the whole burnt offering of the king, and his meat-offering, and the whole burnt offering of all the people, and their meat-offering, and their drink-offering; and you shall pour  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   the blood of every, etc.  </span>  all the blood of the whole burnt offering, and all the blood of   any other   sacrifice upon it: and the brazen altar shall be for me in the morning.  <span class="verse" rel="v01216  016" id="16  016" >16</span>
 And Urias the priest did according to all that king Achaz commanded him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01216  017" id="16  017" >17</span>
 And king Achaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them, and took down the sea from the brazen oxen that were under it, and set it upon a base of stone.  <span class="verse" rel="v01216  018" id="16  018" >18</span>

 For it came to pass that the children of Israel   had   transgressed against the Lord their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharao king of Egypt, and they feared other gods,  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  008" id="17  008" >8</span>

 And they served the idols, of which the Lord said to them, You° shall not do this thing   against   the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  013" id="17  013" >13</span>
 And the Lord testified against Israel and against Juda, even by the hand of all his prophets,   and   of every seer, saying, Turn you° from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my ordinances, and all the law which I commanded your fathers,   and   all that I sent to them by the hand of my servants the prophets.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  014" id="17  014" >14</span>
 But they listened not, and made their  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   back.   Heb. back part of the neck.  </span>  neck harder than the neck of their fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  015" id="17  015" >15</span>
 And they kept not any of his testimonies which he charged them; and they walked after vanities, and became vain, and after the nations round about them, concerning which the Lord had charged them not to do accordingly.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  016" id="17  016" >16</span>
 They forsook the commandments of the Lord their God, and made themselves  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a graven image.  </span>  graven images,   even   two heifers, and they made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  017" id="17  017" >17</span>
 And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divinations and auspices, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   were sold.  </span>  sold themselves to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  018" id="17  018" >18</span>
 And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight; and there was only left the tribe of Juda quite alone.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  019" id="17  019" >19</span>
 Nay even Juda kept not the commandments of the Lord their God, but they walked according to the customs of Israel which they practised, and rejected the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  020" id="17  020" >20</span>
 And the Lord was angry with the whole seed of Israel, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   unsettled them.  </span>  troubled them, and gave them into the hand of them that spoiled them, until he cast them out of his presence.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  021" id="17  021" >21</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The   Complut.   is better, πλὴν ὅτι ἐῤῤάγη ὁ Ἰσραὴλ ἀπ᾿οἴκου κ.τ.λ.  </span>  Forasmuch as Israel revolted from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam the son of Nabat king: and Jeroboam drew off Israel from following the Lord, and led them to sin a great sin.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  022" id="17  022" >22</span>
 And the children of Israel walked in all the sin of Jeroboam which he committed; they departed not from it,  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  023" id="17  023" >23</span>
 until the Lord removed Israel from his presence, as the Lord spoke by  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   by the hand of.  </span>  all his servants the prophets; and Israel was removed from off their land to the Assyrians until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  024" id="17  024" >24</span>
 And the king of Assyria brought from Babylon the men of Chutha,   and men   from Aia, and from Aemath, and Seppharvaim, and they were settled in the cities of Samaria in the place of the children of Israel: and they inherited Samaria, and were settled in its cities.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  025" id="17  025" >25</span>
 And it was so at the beginning of their establishment there   that   they feared not the Lord, and the Lord sent lions among them, and they killed some of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  026" id="17  026" >26</span>
 And they spoke to the king of the Assyrians, saying, The nations whom you have removed and substituted in the cities of Samaria   for the Israelites  , know not  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   judgment.

 And the king of the Assyrians commanded, saying, Bring some   Israelites   thence, and let them go and dwell there, and they shall teach them the manner of the God of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  028" id="17  028" >28</span>
 And they brought one of the priests whom they had removed from Samaria, and he settled in Baethel, and taught them how they should fear the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  029" id="17  029" >29</span>
 But the nations made each their own gods, and put them in the house of the high places which the Samaritans   had   made, each nation in the cities in which they lived.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  030" id="17  030" >30</span>
 And the men of Babylon made Socchoth Benith, and the men of Chuth made Ergel, and the men of Haemath made Asimath.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  031" id="17  031" >31</span>
 And the Evites made Eblazer and Tharthac, and the   inhabitant   of Seppharvaim   did evil   when they burnt their sons in the fire to Adramelech and Anemelech, the gods of Seppharvaim.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  032" id="17  032" >32</span>
 And they feared the Lord, yet they established their abominations in the houses of the high places which they made in Samaria, each nation in the city in which they lived: and they feared the Lord, and they made for themselves priests of the high places, and sacrificed for themselves in the house of the high places.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  033" id="17  033" >33</span>
 And they feared the Lord, and served their gods according to the manner of the nations, whence   their lords   brought them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  034" id="17  034" >34</span>
 Until this day they did according to their manner: they fear   the Lord  , and they do according to their customs, and according to their manner, and according to the law, and according to the commandment which the Lord commanded the sons of Jacob, whose name he made Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  035" id="17  035" >35</span>
 And the Lord made a covenant with them, and charged them, saying, You° shall not fear other gods, neither shall you° worship them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  036" id="17  036" >36</span>
 but only to the Lord, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great strength and with a high arm: him shall you° fear, and him shall you° worship; to him shall you° sacrifice.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  037" id="17  037" >37</span>
 You° shall observe continually the ordinances, and the judgments, and the law, and the commandments which he wrote for you to do; and you° shall not fear other gods.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  038" id="17  038" >38</span>
 Neither shall you° forget the covenant which he made with you: and you° shall not fear other gods.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  039" id="17  039" >39</span>
 But you° shall fear the Lord your God, and he shall deliver you from all your enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  040" id="17  040" >40</span>
 Neither shall you° comply with their practice, which they follow.  <span class="verse" rel="v01217  041" id="17  041" >41</span>
 So these nations feared the Lord, and served their graven images: yes, their sons and their son's sons do until this day even as their fathers did.

<p><span class="chapter" id="18  001">18  </span> And it came to pass in the third year of Osee son of Ela king of Israel   that   Ezekias son of Achaz king of Juda  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   reigned.  </span>  began to reign.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  002" id="18  002" >2</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a son of 25 years in his reigning.  </span>  Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name   was   Abu, daughter of Zacharias.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  003" id="18  003" >3</span>
 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father David did.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  004" id="18  004" >4</span>
 He  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   destroyed.  </span>  removed the high places, and broke in pieces the pillars, and utterly destroyed the groves, and the brazen serpent which Moses made: because until those days the children of Israel burnt incense to it: and he called it Neesthan.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  005" id="18  005" >5</span>
 He  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   hoped.  </span>  trusted in the Lord God of Israel; and after him there was not any like him among the kings of Juda,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and.  </span>  nor among those that were before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  006" id="18  006" >6</span>
 And he clave to the Lord, he departed not  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from behind him.  </span>  from following him; and he kept his commandments, as many as he commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  007" id="18  007" >7</span>
 And the Lord was with him; and he was wise in all that he undertook: and he revolted from the king of the Assyrians, and served him not.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  008" id="18  008" >8</span>
 He struck the Philistines   even   to Gaza, and to the border of it, from the tower of the watchmen even to the strong city.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  009" id="18  009" >9</span>
 And it came to pass in the fourth year of King Ezekias (this is the seventh year of Osee son of Ela king of Israel,)   that   Salamanassar king of the Assyrians came up against Samaria, and besieged it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  010" id="18  010" >10</span>
 And he took it  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from.  </span>  at the end of three years, in the sixth year of Ezekias, (this   is   the ninth year of Osee king of Israel, when Samaria was taken.)  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  011" id="18  011" >11</span>
 And the king of the Assyrians carried away the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.

 because they listened not to the voice of the Lord their God, and transgressed his covenant,   even   in all things that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded, and listened not   to them  , nor did   them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  013" id="18  013" >13</span>
 And in the fourteenth year of king Ezekias came up Sennacherim king of the Assyrians against the strong cities of Juda, and took them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  014" id="18  014" >14</span>
 And Ezekias king of Juda sent messengers to the king of the Assyrians to Lachis, saying, I have offended; depart from me: whatever you shall lay upon me, I will bear. And the king of Assyria laid upon Ezekias king of Juda   a tribute of   three hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  015" id="18  015" >15</span>
 And Ezekias gave all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  016" id="18  016" >16</span>
 At that time Ezekias cut off   the gold from   the doors of the temple, and   from   the pillars which Ezekias king of Juda   had   overlaid with gold, and gave  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   them.  </span>  it to the king of the Assyrians.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  017" id="18  017" >17</span>
 And the king of the Assyrians sent Tharthan and Raphis and Rapsakes from Lachis to king Ezekias with a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   heavy.  </span>  strong force against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem, and stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool, which is by the way of the fuller's field.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  018" id="18  018" >18</span>
 And they cried to Ezekias: and there came to him Heliakim the son of Chelcias the steward, and Somnas the scribe, and Joas the son of Saphat the recorder.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  019" id="18  019" >19</span>
 And Rapsakes said to them, Say now to Ezekias, Thus says the king, the great king of the Assyrians, What   is   this confidence wherein you trust?  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  020" id="18  020" >20</span>
 You have said, (but   they are    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   words of lips.  </span>  mere words,)   I have   counsel and strength for war. Now then  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in whom trusting, etc.  </span>  in whom do you trust, that you have revolted from me?  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  021" id="18  021" >21</span>
 See now, are you trusting for yourself on this broken staff of reed,   even   upon Egypt? whoever shall stay himself upon it, it shall even go into his hand, and pierce it: so   is   Pharao king of Egypt to all that trust on him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  022" id="18  022" >22</span>
 And whereas you have said to me, We trust on the Lord God:   is   not this he,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   his.  </span>  whose high places and altars Ezekias has removed, and has said to Juda and Jerusalem, You° shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  023" id="18  023" >23</span>
 And now, I pray you, make and agreement with my lord the king of the Assyrians, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you shall be able on your part to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   give.  </span>  set riders upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  024" id="18  024" >24</span>
 How then will you turn away the face of one  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   local ruler.  </span>  petty governor, from among the least of my lord's servants? whereas you trust for yourself on Egypt for chariots and horsemen.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  025" id="18  025" >25</span>
 And now have we come up without the Lord against this place to destroy it? The Lord said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  026" id="18  026" >26</span>
 And Heliakim the son of Chelkias, and Somnas, and Joas, said to Rapsakes, Speak now to your servants in the Syrian language, for we understand it; and speak not with us in the Jewish language: and why do you speak in the ears of the people that are on the wall?  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  027" id="18  027" >27</span>
 And Rapsakes said to them, Has my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words?   has he   not   sent me   to the men who sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own water together with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  028" id="18  028" >28</span>
 And Rapsakes stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish language, and spoke, and said, Hear the words of the great king of the Assyrians:  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  029" id="18  029" >29</span>
 thus says the king, Let not Ezekias encourage you with words: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  030" id="18  030" >30</span>
 And let not Ezekias cause you to trust on the Lord, saying, The Lord will certainly deliver us; this city shall not be delivered  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in.  </span>  into the hand of the king of the Assyrians: listen not to Ezekias:  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  031" id="18  031" >31</span>
 for thus says the king of the Assyrians,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   make a blessing with me.  </span>  Gain my favor, and come forth to me, and every man shall drink   of the wine   of his own vine, and every man shall eat of his own fig tree, and shall drink water out of his own cistern;  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  032" id="18  032" >32</span>
 until I come and remove you to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, and bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil, and honey, and you° shall live and not die: and do not you° listen to Ezekias, for he deceives you, saying, The Lord shall deliver you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  033" id="18  033" >33</span>
 Have the Gods of the nations at all delivered each their own land out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians?  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  034" id="18  034" >34</span>
 Where is the god of Haemath, and of Arphad? where is the god of Seppharvaim, Ana, and Aba? for have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  035" id="18  035" >35</span>
 Who   is there   among all the gods of the countries, who have delivered their countries out of my hand, that the Lord  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   shall deliver.  </span>  should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  036" id="18  036" >36</span>
 But   the men   were silent, and answered him not a word: for   there was   a commandment of the king, saying, You° shall not answer him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01218  037" id="18  037" >37</span>
 And Heliakim the son of Chelcias, the steward, and Somnas the scribe, and Joas the son of Saphat the recorder came in to Ezekias, having tore their garments; and they reported to him the words of Rapsakes.

<p><span class="chapter" id="19  001">19  </span> And it came to pass when king Ezekias heard it, that he tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth, an went into the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01219  002" id="19  002" >2</span>
 And he sent Heliakim the steward, and Somnas the scribe, and the elders of the priests, clothed with  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   sackcloth.  </span>  sackcloth, to Esaias the prophet the son of Amos.  <span class="verse" rel="v01219  003" id="19  003" >3</span>
 And they said to him, Thus says Ezekias, This day   is   a day of tribulation, and rebuke, and provocation: for the children are come to the travail-  pangs  , but the mother has no strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v01219  004" id="19  004" >4</span>

 And Esaias said to them, Thus shall you° say to your master, Thus says the Lord, Be not afraid of the words which you have heard, wherewith the servants of the king of the Assyrians have blasphemed.  <span class="verse" rel="v01219  007" id="19  007" >7</span>

 So Rapsakes returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Lobna: for he heard that he   had   departed from Lachis.  <span class="verse" rel="v01219  009" id="19  009" >9</span>
 And he heard concerning Tharaca king of the Ethiopians, saying, Behold, he is come forth to fight with you: and he returned, and sent messengers to Ezekias, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01219  010" id="19  010" >10</span>

 And now, O Lord our God, deliver us out of his hand, and all the kingdoms of the earth shall know that you alone   are   the Lord God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01219  020" id="19  020" >20</span>
 And Esaias the son of Amos sent to Ezekias, saying, Thus says the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, I have heard  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   what things you have prayed.  </span>  your prayer to me concerning Sennacherim king of the Assyrians.  <span class="verse" rel="v01219  021" id="19  021" >21</span>
 This   is   the word which the Lord has spoken against him; The virgin daughter of Sion has made light of you, and mocked you; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01219  022" id="19  022" >22</span>
 Whom have you reproached, and whom have you reviled? and against whom have you lifted up your voice, and raised your eyes on high?   Is it   against the Holy One of Israel?  <span class="verse" rel="v01219  023" id="19  023" >23</span>
 By  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   by the hand of.  </span>  your messengers you have reproached the Lord, and have said, I will go up with the multitude of my chariots, to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Libanus, and I have cut down the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   bulk or size.  </span>  height of his cedar,   and   his choice cypresses; and I have come into the midst of the forest and of Carmel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01219  024" id="19  024" >24</span>
 I have  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.   reads ἐφύλαξα.  </span>  refreshed   myself  , and have drunk strange waters, and I have dried up with the sole of my foot all the rivers of fortified places.  <span class="verse" rel="v01219  025" id="19  025" >25</span>

 And they that lived in them were weak in hand, they quaked and were confounded, they became   as   grass of the field, or   as   the green herb, the grass   growing on   houses, and that which is trodden down  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   before it stands up.  </span>  by him that stands   upon it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01219  027" id="19  027" >27</span>

 And this shall be a sign to you; eat this year the things that grow of themselves, and in the second year the things which spring up: and in the third year   let there be   sowing, and reaping, and planting of vineyards, and eat you° the fruit of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01219  030" id="19  030" >30</span>

 And it came to pass at night that the angel of the Lord went forth, an struck in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand: and they rose early in the morning, and, behold,   these were   all dead corpses.  <span class="verse" rel="v01219  036" id="19  036" >36</span>
 And Sennacherim king of the Assyrians departed, and went and returned, and lived in Nineve.  <span class="verse" rel="v01219  037" id="19  037" >37</span>
 And it came to pass, while he was worshipping in the house of Meserach his god, that Adramelech and Sarasar his sons struck him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararath; and Asordan his son reigned in his stead.

<p><span class="chapter" id="20  001">20  </span> In those days was Ezekias sick   even   to death. And the prophet Esaias the son of Amos came in to him, and said to him, Thus says the Lord, Give charge to your household;   for   you  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   die.  </span>  shall die, and not live.  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  002" id="20  002" >2</span>
 And Ezekias turned to the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  003" id="20  003" >3</span>
 Lord, remember, I pray you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   full.  </span>  perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your eyes. And Ezekias wept with a great weeping.  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  004" id="20  004" >4</span>
 And Esaias was in the middle court, and the word of the Lord came to him, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  005" id="20  005" >5</span>
 Turn back, and you shall say to Ezekias the ruler of my people, Thus says the Lord God of your father David, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears: behold, I will heal you: on the third day you shall go up to the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  006" id="20  006" >6</span>
 And I will add to your days fifteen years; and I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians, and I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant's David sake.  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  007" id="20  007" >7</span>
 And he said, Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it upon the ulcer, and he shall be well.  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  008" id="20  008" >8</span>
 And Ezekias said to Esaias, What   is   the sign that the Lord will heal me, and I shall go up to the house of the Lord on the third day?  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  009" id="20  009" >9</span>
 And Esaias said, This   is   the sign from the Lord, that the Lord will perform the word which he has spoken, the shadow   of the dial   shall advance ten degrees:   or   if it should go back ten degrees   this would also be the sign  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  010" id="20  010" >10</span>
 And Ezekias said,   It is   a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return ten degrees backward  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or.   in the degrees.  </span>  on the dial.  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  011" id="20  011" >11</span>
 And Esaias the prophet cried to the Lord: and the shadow returned back ten degrees on the dial.  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  012" id="20  012" >12</span>
 At that time Marodach Baladan, son of Baladan king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Ezekias, because he had heard that Ezekias was sick.  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  013" id="20  013" >13</span>
 And Ezekias rejoiced at them, and showed all the house of his spices, the silver and the gold, the spices, and the fine oil, and the armory, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing which Ezekias did not show them in his house, and in all his dominion.  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  014" id="20  014" >14</span>
 And Esaias the prophet went in to king Ezekias, and said to him, What said these men? and whence came they to you? And Ezekias said, they came to me from a distant land,   even   from Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  015" id="20  015" >15</span>
 And he said, What saw they in your house? And he said, They saw all things that   are   in my house: there was nothing in my house which I showed not to them; yes, all that was in my treasures also.  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  016" id="20  016" >16</span>
 And Esaias said to Ezekias, Hear the word of the Lord:  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  017" id="20  017" >17</span>
 Behold, the days come, that all things that are in your house shall be taken, and all that your fathers have treasured up until this day, to Babylon; and there shall not  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   be left behind.  </span>  fail a word, which the Lord has spoken.  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  018" id="20  018" >18</span>
 And as for your sons which shall come forth of you, which you shall beget,   the enemy   shall take them, and they shall be eunuchs in the house of the king of Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  019" id="20  019" >19</span>
 And Ezekias said to Esaias, Good   is   the word of the Lord which he has spoken:   only   let there be peace in my days.  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  020" id="20  020" >20</span>
 And the rest of the acts of Ezekias, and all his might, and all that he made, the fountain and the aqueduct, and   how   he brought water into the city,   are   not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?  <span class="verse" rel="v01220  021" id="20  021" >21</span>
 And Ezekias slept with his fathers: and Manasses his son reigned in his stead.

<p><span class="chapter" id="21  001">21  </span>   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a son of 12 years in his reigning.  </span>  Manasses   was   twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name   was   Apsiba.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  002" id="21  002" >2</span>
 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, according to the abominations of the nations which the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  003" id="21  003" >3</span>
 And he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   returned and built.  </span>  built again the high places, which Ezekias his father   had   demolished; and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or.   built.  </span>  set up an altar to Baal, and made groves as Achaab king of Israel   made them  ; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  004" id="21  004" >4</span>
 And he built an altar in the house of the Lord, whereas he had said, In Jerusalem I will place my name.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  005" id="21  005" >5</span>
 And he built an altar to all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  006" id="21  006" >6</span>
 And he caused his sons to pass through the fire, and used divination and auspices, and made  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   peculiar places cut off.  </span>  groves, and multiplied  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.   θελητὴν.  </span>  wizards, so as to do that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  007" id="21  007" >7</span>
 And he set up the graven image of the grove in the house of which the Lord said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I even place my name for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  008" id="21  008" >8</span>
 And I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I gave to their fathers,   even of those   who shall keep all that I commanded, according to all the commandments which my servant Moses commanded them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  009" id="21  009" >9</span>
 But they listened not; and Manasses led them astray to do evil in the sight of the Lord, beyond the nations whom the Lord utterly destroyed from before the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  010" id="21  010" >10</span>
 And the Lord spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  011" id="21  011" >11</span>
 Forasmuch as Manasses the king of Juda has wrought all these evil abominations, beyond all that the Amorite did, who lived before   him  , and has led Juda also into sin by their idols,  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  012" id="21  012" >12</span>
    it shall   not   be   so. Thus says the Lord God of Israel, Behold, I bring calamities upon Jerusalem and Juda, so that both the ears of every one that hears shall  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   sound.  </span>  tingle.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  013" id="21  013" >13</span>
 And I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measure of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Achaab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a jar is wiped, and turned upside down in the wiping.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  014" id="21  014" >14</span>
 And I will reject the remnant of my inheritance, and will deliver them into the hands of their enemies; and they shall be for a plunder and for a spoil to all their enemies:  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  015" id="21  015" >15</span>
 forasmuch as they have done wickedly in my sight, and have provoked me from the day that I brought out their fathers out of Egypt, even until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  016" id="21  016" >16</span>
 Moreover Manasses shed very much innocent blood, until he filled Jerusalem   with it    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   mouth to mouth.  </span>  from one end to the other, beside his sins with which he caused Juda to sin, in doing evil in the eyes of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  017" id="21  017" >17</span>
 And the rest of the acts of Manasses, and all that he did, and his sin which he sinned,   are   not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  018" id="21  018" >18</span>
 And Manasses slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his house,   even   in the garden of Oza: and Amos his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  019" id="21  019" >19</span>
 Twenty and two years old   was   Amos when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name   was   Mesollam, daughter of Arus of Jeteba.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  020" id="21  020" >20</span>
 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as Manasses his father did.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  021" id="21  021" >21</span>
 And he walked in all the way in which his father walked, and served the idols which his father served, and worshipped them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  022" id="21  022" >22</span>
 And he forsook the Lord God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  023" id="21  023" >23</span>
 And the servants of Amos conspired against him, and killed the king in his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  024" id="21  024" >24</span>
 And the people of the land  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   struck.  </span>  killed all that had conspired against king Amos; and the people of the land made Josias king in his room.  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  025" id="21  025" >25</span>
 And the rest of the acts of Amos,   even   all that he did, behold,   are   not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?  <span class="verse" rel="v01221  026" id="21  026" >26</span>

 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all the way of David his father; he turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.  <span class="verse" rel="v01222  003" id="22  003" >3</span>
 And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josias, in the eighth month, the king sent Sapphan the son of Ezelias the son of Mesollam, the scribe of the house of the Lord, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01222  004" id="22  004" >4</span>
 Go up to Chelcias the high priest, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   seal.  </span>  take account of the money that is brought into the house of the Lord, which they that keep the door have collected of the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01222  005" id="22  005" >5</span>
 And let them give it into the hand of the workmen that are appointed in the house of the Lord.

 Only they did not call them to account for the money that was given to them, because they dealt faithfully.  <span class="verse" rel="v01222  008" id="22  008" >8</span>
 And Chelcias the high priest said to Saphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Chelcias gave the book to Sapphan, and he read it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01222  009" id="22  009" >9</span>
 And he went into the house of the Lord to the king, and reported the matter to the king, and said, Your servants have  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   melted down.  </span>  collected the money that was found in the house of the Lord, and have given it into the hand of the workmen that are appointed in the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01222  010" id="22  010" >10</span>
 And Sapphan the scribe spoke to the king, saying, Chelcias the priest has given me a book. And Sapphan read it before the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01222  011" id="22  011" >11</span>
 And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the book of the law, that he tore his garments.  <span class="verse" rel="v01222  012" id="22  012" >12</span>
 And the king commanded Chelcias the priest, and Achikam the son of Sapphan, and Achobor the son of Michaias, and Sapphan the scribe, and Asaias the king's servant, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01222  013" id="22  013" >13</span>
 Go, enquire of the Lord for me, and for all the people, and for all Juda, and concerning the words of this book that has been found: for the wrath of the Lord that has been kindled against us   is   great, because our fathers listened not to the words of this book, to do according to all the things written concerning us.  <span class="verse" rel="v01222  014" id="22  014" >14</span>
 So Chelcias the priest went, and Achicam, and Achobor, and Sapphan, and Asaias, to Olda the prophetess, the mother of Sellem the son of Thecuan son of Aras, keeper of the robes; and she lived in Jerusalem in  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        A.V.

<p><span class="chapter" id="23  001">23  </span> So they reported the word to the king: and the king sent and gathered all the elders of Juda and Jerusalem  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   to his house.  </span>  to himself.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  002" id="23  002" >2</span>
 And the king went up to the house of the Lord, and every man of Juda and all who lived in Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people small and great; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  003" id="23  003" >3</span>
 And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord, to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his ordinances with all the heart and with all the soul, to confirm the words of this covenant;   even   the things written  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   on.  </span>  in this book.

 And the king commanded Chelcias the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and them that kept the door, to bring out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and all the host of heaven, and he burned them without Jerusalem in the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The   Gr.   is from the   Heb.   word.  </span>  fields of Kedron, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   cast.  </span>  took the ashes of them to Baethel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  005" id="23  005" >5</span>
 And he burned the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. הבמויס.  </span>  idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Juda   had    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   given.  </span>  appointed, (and they burned incense in the high places and in the cities of Juda, and the places around about Jerusalem); and them that burned incense to Baal, and to the sun, and to the moon, and to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or.   the twelve signs.

 And he carried out the grove from the house of the Lord to the brook Kedron, and burned it at the brook Kedron, and reduced it to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   ashes.  </span>  powder, and cast its powder on the sepulchres of the sons of the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  007" id="23  007" >7</span>

 And he brought up all the priest from the cities of Juda, and defiled the high places where the priests burned incense, from Gaebal even to Bersabee; and he pulled down the house of the gates that was by the door of the gate of Joshua the ruler of the city, on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  009" id="23  009" >9</span>
 Only the priests of the high places went not up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem, for they only ate leavened bread in the midst of their brethren.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  010" id="23  010" >10</span>
 And he defiled Taphes which is in the valley of the son of Ennom,   constructed   for a man to cause his son or his daughter to pass through  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in fire.  </span>  fire to Moloch.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  011" id="23  011" >11</span>
 And he burned the horses which the king of Juda had given to the sun in the entrance of the house of the Lord,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to.  </span>  by the treasury of Nathan the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb.

 And the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Achaz, which the kings of Juda had made, and the altars which Manasses had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord, did the king pull down and forcibly remove from thence, and cast their dust into the brook of Kedron.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  013" id="23  013" >13</span>
 And the king defiled the house that was before Jerusalem, on the right hand of the mount of Mosthath, which Solomon king of Israel built to Astarte the abomination of the Sidonians, and to Chamos the abomination of Moab, and to Moloch the abomination of the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  014" id="23  014" >14</span>
 And he broke in pieces the pillars, and utterly destroyed the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  015" id="23  015" >15</span>
 Also the high altar in Baethel, which Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that high altar he tore down, and broke in pieces the stones of it, and reduced it to powder, and burnt the grove.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  016" id="23  016" >16</span>
 And Josias turned aside, and saw the tombs that were there in the city, and sent, and took the bones out of the tombs, and burnt them on the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of the Lord which the man of God spoke, when Jeroboam stood by the altar at the feast: and he turned and raised his eyes to the tomb of the man of God that spoke these words.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  017" id="23  017" >17</span>
 And he said, What   is   that mound which I see? And the men of the city said to him,   It is the grave of   the man of God that came out of Juda, and uttered these imprecations which he imprecated upon the altar of Baethel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  018" id="23  018" >18</span>
 And he said, Let him alone; let no one disturb his bones. So his bones were  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   delivered.  </span>  spared, together with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  019" id="23  019" >19</span>
 Moreover Josias removed all the houses of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel made to provoke the Lord, and did to them all that he did in Baethel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  020" id="23  020" >20</span>
 And he sacrificed all the priests of the high places that were there on the altars, and burnt the bones of men upon them, and returned to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  021" id="23  021" >21</span>
 And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover to the Lord your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  022" id="23  022" >22</span>
 For a passover   such as   this had not been kept from the days of the judges who judged Israel, even all the days of the kings of Israel, and of the kings of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  023" id="23  023" >23</span>
 But in the eighteenth year of king Josias, was the passover kept to the Lord in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  024" id="23  024" >24</span>
 Moreover Josias removed the sorcerers, and the wizards, and the theraphin, and the idols, and all the abominations that had been set up in the land of Juda and in Jerusalem, that he might  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   establish or confirm.  </span>  keep the words of the law that were written in the book, which Chelcias the priest found in the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  025" id="23  025" >25</span>
 There was no king like him before him, who turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his strength, according to all the law of Moses; and after him there rose not one like him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  026" id="23  026" >26</span>
 Nevertheless the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great anger, wherewith he was angry in his anger against Juda,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   upon or against.  </span>  because of the provocations, wherewith Manasses provoked him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  027" id="23  027" >27</span>
 And the Lord said, I will also remove Juda from my presence, as I removed Israel, and will reject this city which I have chosen   even   Jerusalem, and the house   of   which I said, My name shall be there.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  028" id="23  028" >28</span>
 And the rest of the acts of Josias, and all that he did,   are   not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  029" id="23  029" >29</span>
 And in his days went up Pharao Nechao king of Egypt against the king of the Assyrians to the river Euphrates: and Josias went out to meet him: and Nechao killed him in Mageddo when he saw him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  030" id="23  030" >30</span>
 And his servants carried him dead from Mageddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre: and the people of the land took Joachaz the son of Josias, and anointed him, and made him king in the room of his father.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  031" id="23  031" >31</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a son of 23 years was Joachaz in his reigning.  </span>  Twenty and three years old was Joachaz when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother's name   was   Amital, daughter of Jeremias of Lobna.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  032" id="23  032" >32</span>
 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers did.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  033" id="23  033" >33</span>
 And Pharao Nechao removed him to Rablaam in the land of Emath, so that he should not reign in Jerusalem; and imposed a tribute on the land, a hundred talents of silver, and a hundred talents of gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  034" id="23  034" >34</span>
 And Pharao Nechao made Eliakim son of Josias king of Juda king over them in the place of his father Josias, and he changed his name   to   Joakim, and he took Joachaz and brought him to Egypt, and he died there.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  035" id="23  035" >35</span>
 And Joakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharao; but he assessed the land to give the money at the command of Pharao: they gave the silver and the gold   each   man according to his assessment together with the people of the land to give to Pharao Nechao.  <span class="verse" rel="v01223  036" id="23  036" >36</span>

 And the lord sent against him the bands of the Chaldeans, and the bands of Syria, and the bans of Moab, and the bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them into the land of Juda to prevail   against it  , according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke by his servants the prophets.  <span class="verse" rel="v01224  003" id="24  003" >3</span>

 And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Sedekias on the ninth day of the month.  <span class="verse" rel="v01225  003" id="25  003" >3</span>
 And the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v01225  004" id="25  004" >4</span>
 And the city was broken up, and all the men of war went forth by night, by the way of the gate between the walls, this is   the gate   of the king's garden: and the Chaldeans   were set   against the city round about: and   the king   went by the way of  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from the   Heb.  </span>  the plain.  <span class="verse" rel="v01225  005" id="25  005" >5</span>

 Two pillars, and one sea, and the bases which Solomon made for the house of the Lord: there was no weight of the brass of all the vessels.  <span class="verse" rel="v01225  017" id="25  017" >17</span>

 And Nabuzardan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Reblatha.  <span class="verse" rel="v01225  021" id="25  021" >21</span>
 And the king of Babylon struck them and killed them at Reblatha in the land of Aemath. So Juda was carried away from his land.  <span class="verse" rel="v01225  022" id="25  022" >22</span>
 And   as for   the people that were left in the land of Juda, whom Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon left, even over them he set Godolias son of Achicam son of Saphan.  <span class="verse" rel="v01225  023" id="25  023" >23</span>
 And all the captains of the host, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had   thus   appointed Godolias, and they came to Godolias to Massephath, both Ismael the son of Nathanias, and Jona son of Careth, and Saraias, son of Thanamath the Netophathite, and Jezonias son of a Machathite, they and their men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01225  024" id="25  024" >24</span>

 And all the people, great and small rose up,   they   and the captains of the forces, and went into Egypt; because they were afraid of the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" rel="v01225  027" id="25  027" >27</span>
 And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the carrying away of Joachim king of Juda, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month,   that   Evialmarodec king of Babylon in the   first   year of his reign lifted up the head of Joachim king of Juda, and brought him out of his prison-house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01225  028" id="25  028" >28</span>
 And he spoke  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   good things with him.  </span>  kindly to him, and set his throne above the thrones of the kings that were with him in Babylon;  <span class="verse" rel="v01225  029" id="25  029" >29</span>
 And changed his prison garments: and he ate bread continually before him all the days of his life.  <span class="verse" rel="v01225  030" id="25  030" >30</span>
 And his portion, a continual portion, was given him out of the house of the king,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a rate of a day in his day.  </span>  a daily rate for every day all the days of his life.
