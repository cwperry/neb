<h2>(1 Kings) </h2>
<!-- 1   001 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">A</span>nd king David   was   old and advanced in days, and they covered him with clothes, and he was not warmed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 And his servants said, Let them seek for the king a young virgin, and she shall wait on the king, and cherish him, and lie with him, and my lord the king shall be warmed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 So they sought for a fair damsel out of all the coasts of Israel; and they found Abisag the Somanite, and they brought her to the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And the damsel was extremely beautiful, and she cherished the king, and ministered to him, but the king knew her not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 And Adonias the son of Aggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king; and he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   made.  </span>  prepared for himself chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 And his father never at any time checked him, saying, Why have you done   thus  ? and he was also very handsome in appearance, and his mother bore him after Abessalom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 And he conferred with Joab the son of Saruia, and with Abiathar the priest, and they  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   came to his assistance.  </span>  followed after Adonias.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 But Sadoc the priest, and Banaeas the son of Jodae, and Nathan the prophet, and Semei, and Resi, and the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   mighty sons.   Hebraism. </span>  mighty men of David, did not follow Adonias.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 And Adonias sacrificed sheep and calves and lambs by the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        So the   Alex.   The   Vat.   renders אבן as if it were אחי   or   אחה.  </span>  stone of Zoelethi, which was near  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. and   Alex.   the fountain of Rogel.  </span>  Rogel: and he called all his brethren, and all the adult   men   of Juda, servants of the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 But Nathan the prophet, and Banaeas, and the mighty   men  , and Solomon his brother, he did not call.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 And Nathan spoke to Bersabee the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast you not heard that Adonias the son of Aggith  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   reigned.  </span>  reigns, and our lord David  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   knew.  </span>  knows it not?  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 And now come, let me, I pray, give you counsel, and you shall rescue your life, and the life of your son Solomon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 Haste, and go in to king David, and you shall speak to him, saying, Hast not you, my lord, O king, sworn to your handmaid, saying, Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then does Adonias reign?  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 And behold, while you are still speaking there with the king, I also will come in after you, and will  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   fulfil.  </span>  confirm your words.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 So Bersabee went in to the king into the chamber: and the king was very old, and Abisag the Somanite was ministering to the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 And Bersabee bowed, and did obeisance to the king; and the king said, What is your request?  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 And she said, My lord, you did swear by the Lord your God to your handmaid, saying, Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and shall sit upon my throne.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 And now, behold, Adonias reigns, and you, my lord, O king, know   it   not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 And he has sacrificed calves and lambs and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander-in-chief of the host; but Solomon your servant he has not called.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 And you, my lord, O king, —the eyes of all Israel   are   upon you, to tell them who shall sit upon the throne of my lord the king after him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  021" id="1  021" >21</span>
 And it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and Solomon my son shall be offenders.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  022" id="1  022" >22</span>
 And behold, while she was yet talking with the king, Nathan the prophet came. And it was reported to the king,  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  023" id="1  023" >23</span>
 Behold, Nathan the prophet   is here  : and he came in to the king's presence, and did obeisance to the king with his face to the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  024" id="1  024" >24</span>
 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, did you say, Adonias shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  025" id="1  025" >25</span>
 For he has gone down today, and has sacrificed calves and lambs and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the chiefs of the army, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and they said,   Long   live king Adonias.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  026" id="1  026" >26</span>
 But he has not invited me your servant, and Sadoc the priest, and Banaeas the son of Jodae, and Solomon your servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  027" id="1  027" >27</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   if.  </span>  Has this matter happened by the authority of my lord the king, and have you not made known to your servant who shall sit upon the throne of my lord the king after him?  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  028" id="1  028" >28</span>
 And king David answered and said, Call me Bersabee: and she came in before the king, and stood before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  029" id="1  029" >29</span>
 And the king swore, and said,   As   the Lord lives who redeemed my soul out of all affliction,  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  030" id="1  030" >30</span>
 as I swore to you by the Lord God of Israel, saying, Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead, so will I do this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  031" id="1  031" >31</span>
 And Bersabee bowed with her face to the ground, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  032" id="1  032" >32</span>
 And king David said, Call me Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaeas the son of Jodae: and they came in before the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  033" id="1  033" >33</span>
 And the king said to them, Take the servants of your lord with you, and mount my son Solomon upon my own mule, and bring him down to Gion.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  034" id="1  034" >34</span>
 And there let Sadoc the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him to be king over Israel, and do you° sound the trumpet, and you° shall say, Let king Solomon live.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  035" id="1  035" >35</span>
 And he shall sit upon my throne, and reign in my stead: and I have given charge that he should be for a prince over Israel and Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  036" id="1  036" >36</span>
 And Banaeas the son of Jodae answered the king and said, So let it be: may the Lord God of my lord the king confirm   it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  037" id="1  037" >37</span>
 As the Lord was with my lord the king, so let him be with Solomon, and let him  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   magnify.  </span>  exalt his throne beyond the throne of my lord king David.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  038" id="1  038" >38</span>
 And Sadoc the priest went down, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaeas son of Jodae, and the Cherethite, and the Phelethite, and they mounted Solomon upon the mule of king David, and led him away to Gion.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  039" id="1  039" >39</span>
 And Sadoc the priest took the horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon, and blew the trumpet; and all the people said, Let king Solomon live.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  040" id="1  040" >40</span>
 And all the people went up after him, and they danced in choirs, and rejoiced with great joy, and the earth  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   burst.  </span>  quaked with their voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  041" id="1  041" >41</span>
 And Adonias and all his guests heard, and they had   just   left off eating: and Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, and said, What   means   the voice of the city in tumult?  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  042" id="1  042" >42</span>
 While he was yet speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came in: and Adonias said, Come in, for you are a mighty man, and   you come   to bring glad tidings.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  043" id="1  043" >43</span>
 And Jonathan answered and said, Verily our lord king David has made Solomon king:  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  044" id="1  044" >44</span>
 and the king has sent with him Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaeas the son of Jodae, and the Cherethite, and the Phelethite, and they have mounted him on the king's mule;  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  045" id="1  045" >45</span>
 and Sadoc the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him in Gion, and have gone up thence rejoicing, and the city resounded: this   is   the sound which you° have heard.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  046" id="1  046" >46</span>
 And Solomon is seated upon the throne of the kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  047" id="1  047" >47</span>
 And the servants of the king have gone in to bless our lord king David, saying, God  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   do good   or   make good.  </span>  make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne; and the king worshipped upon his bed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  048" id="1  048" >48</span>
 Moreover thus said the king, Blessed   be   the Lord God of Israel, who has this day  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   given.  </span>  appointed one of my seed sitting on my throne, and my eyes see it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  049" id="1  049" >49</span>
 And all the guests of Adonias were dismayed, and every man went his way.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  050" id="1  050" >50</span>
 And Adonias feared because of Solomon, and arose, and departed, and laid hold on the horns of the altar.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  051" id="1  051" >51</span>
 And it was reported to Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonias fears king Solomon, and holds the horns of the altar, saying, Let Solomon swear to me this day, that he will not kill his servant with the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  052" id="1  052" >52</span>
 And Solomon said, If he should be a valiant man, there shall not a hair of his fall to the ground; but if evil be found in him, he shall die.  <span class="verse" rel="v0111  053" id="1  053" >53</span>
 And king Solomon sent, and they brought him away from the altar; and he went in and did obeisance to king Solomon: and Solomon said to him, Go to your house.  
<!-- 2   053 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> And the days of David drew near that he should die: and he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   answered.  </span>  addressed his son Solomon, saying, I go the way of all the earth:  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 but be you strong, and show yourself a man;  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 and keep the charge of the Lord your God, to walk in his ways, to keep the commandments and the ordinances and the judgments which are written in the law of Moses; that you may understand what you shall do in all things that I command you:  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 that the Lord may confirm his word which he spoke, saying, If your children shall take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart,   I promise you  , saying, there shall not  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   be destroyed to you.  </span>  fail you a man on the throne of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 Moreover you know all that Joab the son of Saruia did to me, what he did to the two captains of the forces of Israel, to Abenner the son of Ner, and to Amessai the son of Jether, that he killed them, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   ordered.  </span>  shed the blood of war in peace, and put innocent blood on his girdle that was about his loins, and on his sandal that was on his foot.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 Therefore you shall deal   with him   according to your wisdom, and you shall not bring down his grey hairs in peace to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   Hades.  </span>  the grave.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 But you shall deal kindly with the sons of Berzelli the Galaadite, and they shall be among those that eat at your table; for thus they drew near to me when I fled from the face of your brother Abessalom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 And, behold,   there is   with you Semei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Baurim: and he cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went into the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   camps.  </span>  camp; and he came down to Jordan to meet me, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying, I will not put you to death with the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 But you shall by no means hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man, and will know what you shall do to him, and shall bring down his grey hairs with blood to the grave.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 And the days which David reigned over Israel   were   forty years; he reigned seven years in Chebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 And Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   prepared.  </span>  established greatly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 And Adonias the son of Aggith came in to Bersabee the mother of Solomon, and did obeisance to her: and she said,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   Is your entrance peace?  </span>  Do you enter peaceably? and he said, Peaceably:  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 I have business with you. And she said to him, Say on.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 And he said to her, You know that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel turned their face toward me for a king; but the kingdom was turned   from me   and became my brother's: for it was   appointed   to him from the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 And now I make one request of you, do not turn away your face. And Bersabee said to him, Speak   on  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 And he said to her, Speak, I pray you, to king Solomon, for he will not turn away his face from you, and let him give me Abisag the Somanite for a wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 And Bersabee said, Well; I will speak for you to the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 And Bersabee went in to king Solomon to speak to him concerning Adonias; and the king rose up to meet her, and kissed her, and sat on the throne, and a throne was set for the mother of the king, and she sat on his right hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 And she said to him, I ask of you one little request; turn not away my face from you. And the king said to her, Ask, my mother, and I will not reject you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 And she said, Let, I pray you, Abisag the Somanite be given to Adonias your brother to wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why have you asked Abisag for Adonias? ask for him the kingdom also; for he   is   my elder brother, and he has for his companion Abiathar the priest, and Joab the son of Saruia the commander-in-chief.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  023" id="2  023" >23</span>
 And king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying, God do so to me, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   add these things.  </span>  more also,   if it be not   that Adonias has spoken this word against his own life.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  024" id="2  024" >24</span>
 And now   as   the Lord lives who has established me, and set me on the throne of my father David, and he has made me a house, as the Lord spoke, this day shall Adonias be put to death.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  025" id="2  025" >25</span>
 So king Solomon sent by the hand of Banaeas the son of Jodae, and he killed him, and Adonias died in that day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  026" id="2  026" >26</span>
 And the king said to Abiathar the priest, Depart you quickly to Anathoth to your farm, for you are  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a man of death.  </span>  worthy of death this day; but I will not kill you, because you have borne the ark of the covenant of the Lord before my father, and because you was afflicted in all things wherein my father was afflicted.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  027" id="2  027" >27</span>
 And Solomon removed Abiathar from being a priest of the Lord, that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   against.  </span>  concerning the house of Heli in Selom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  028" id="2  028" >28</span>
 And the report came to Joab son of Saruia; for Joab had turned after Adonias, and he went not after Solomon: and Joab fled to the tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  029" id="2  029" >29</span>
 And it was told Solomon, saying, Joab has fled to the tabernacle of the Lord, and behold! he has hold of the horns of the altar. And king Solomon sent to Joab, saying,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   What has happened to you?  </span>  What ails you, that you have fled to the altar? and Joab said, Because I was afraid of you, and fled for refuge to the Lord. And Solomon sent Banaeas son of Jodae, saying, Go and kill him, and bury him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  030" id="2  030" >30</span>
 And Banaeas son of Jodae came to Joab to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said to him, Thus says the king, Come forth. And Joab said, I  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   do not.  </span>  will not come forth, for I will die here. And Banaeas son of Jodae returned and spoke to the king, saying, Thus has Joab spoken, and thus has he answered me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  031" id="2  031" >31</span>
 And the king said to him, Go, and do to him as he has spoken, and kill him: and you shall bury him, and you shall remove this day the blood which he shed without cause, from me and from the house of my father.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  032" id="2  032" >32</span>
 And the Lord has returned upon his own head the blood of his unrighteousness, inasmuch as he attacked two men more righteous and better than himself, and killed them with the sword, and my father David knew not of their blood,   even   Abenner the son of Ner the commander-in-chief of Israel, and Amessa the son of Jether the commander-in-chief of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  033" id="2  033" >33</span>
 And their blood is returned upon his head, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but to David, and his seed, and his house, and his throne, may there be peace for ever from the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  034" id="2  034" >34</span>
 So Banaeas son of Jodae went up, and attacked him, and killed him, and buried him in his house in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0112  035" id="2  035" >35</span>
 And the king  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   gave.  </span>  appointed Banaeas son of Jodae in his place over the host; and the kingdom was established in Jerusalem; and   as for   Sadoc the priest, the king appointed him to be high priest in the room of Abiathar. And Solomon son of David reigned over Israel and Juda in Jerusalem: and the Lord gave understanding to Solomon, and very much wisdom, and largeness of heart, as the sand by the sea-shore.  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The   Appendix   points out that there is considerable variation in the following section compared with other sources.

<!-- 3   035 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> And the wisdom of Solomon abounded exceedingly beyond the wisdom of all the ancients, and beyond all the wise men of Egypt: and he took the daughter of Pharao, and brought her into the city of David, until he had finished building his own house, and the house of the Lord first, and the wall of Jerusalem round about. In seven years he made and finished   them  .  
<!-- 3   001 -->


<p> And Solomon had seventy thousand bearers of burdens, and eight thousand hewers of stone in the mountain: and Solomon made the sea, and the bases, and the great lavers, and the pillars, and the fountain of the court, and the brazen sea—  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Probably some hiatus in the text.  </span>  and he built the citadel as a defence above it, he made a breach in the wall of the city of David: thus the daughter of Pharao went up out of the city of David to her house which he built for her. Then he built the citadel: and Solomon offered up three whole burnt offerings in the year, and peace-offerings on the altar which he built to the Lord, and he burnt incense before the Lord, and finished the house. And these are the chief persons who presided over the works of Solomon; three thousand and six hundred masters of the people that wrought the works. And he burit Assur, and Magdo, and Gazer, and upper Baethoron, and Ballath: only after he had built the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about, afterwards he built these cities.  
<!-- 3   001 -->


<p> And when David was yet living, he charged Solomon, saying, Behold, there is with you Semei the son of Gera, of the seed of  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   Jemini.  </span>  Benjamin out of Chebron: he cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went into the camp; and he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   if he shall be slain.  </span>  He shall not be slain with the sword. But now do not you hold him guiltless, for you are a man of understanding, and you will know what you shall do to him, and you shall bring down his  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   hoary head.  </span>  grey hairs with blood to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.

<p> 36)    And the king called Semei, and said to him, Build you a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and you shall not go out thence any whither.  
<!-- 3   001 -->


<p> 37)    And it shall come to pass in the day  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   of your going forth.  </span>  that you shall go forth and cross over the brook Kedron,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   knowing you shall know.  </span>  know assuredly that you shall certainly die: your blood shall be upon your head. And the king caused him to swear in that day.  
<!-- 3   001 -->


<p> 38)    And Semei said to the king, Good   is   the word that you have spoken, my lord O king: thus will your servant do. And Semei lived in Jerusalem three years.  
<!-- 3   001 -->


<p> 39)    And it came to pass after the three years, that two servants of Semei ran away to Anchus son of Maacha king of Geth: and it was told Semei, saying, Behold, your servants   are   in Geth.  
<!-- 3   001 -->


<p> 40)    And Semei rose up, and saddled his ass, and went to Geth to Anchus to seek out his servants: and Semei went, and brought his servants out of Geth.  
<!-- 3   001 -->


<p> 41)    And it was told Solomon, saying, Semei is gone out of Jerusalem to Geth, and has brought back his servants.  
<!-- 3   001 -->


<p> 42)    And the king sent and called Semei, and said to him, Did I not adjure you by the Lord, and testify to you, saying, In whatever day you shall go out of Jerusalem, and go to the right or left, know certainly that you shall assuredly die?  
<!-- 3   001 -->


<p> 43)    And why have you not kept the oath of the Lord, and the commandment which I commanded  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   against you.  </span>  you?  
<!-- 3   001 -->


<p> 44)    And the king said to Semei, You know all your mischief which your heart knows, which you did to David my father: and the Lord has recompensed your mischief on your   own   head.  
<!-- 3   001 -->


<p> 45)    And king Solomon   is   blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord for ever.  
<!-- 3   001 -->


<p> 46)    And Solomon commanded Banaeas the son of Jodae, and he went forth and killed him.  
<!-- 3   001 -->


<p> And king Solomon was very prudent and wise: and Juda and Israel   were   very many, as the sand which is by the sea for multitude, eating, and drinking, and rejoicing: and Solomon was chief in all the kingdoms, and they brought gifts, and served Solomon all the days of his life. And Solomon began to open the domains of Libanus, and he built Thermae in the wilderness. And this was the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   dinner.  </span>  daily provision of Solomon, thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of ground meal, ten choice calves, and twenty oxen from the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides stags, and does, and choice fed birds.

See   Heb.  </span>  safely, every one under his vine and under his fig tree, eating and drinand feasting, from Dan even to Bersabee, all the days of Solomon.

<p> And these   were   the princes of Solomon; Azariu son of Sadoc the priest, and Orniu son of Nathan chief of the officers, and he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   ran.  </span>  went to his house; and Suba the scribe, and Basa son of Achithalam recorder, and Abi son of Joab commander-in-chief, and Achire son of Edrai   was   over the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or.   tributes.  </span>  levies, and Banaeas son of Jodae over the household and over the brick work, and Cachur the son of Nathan   was   counsellor.  
<!-- 3   001 -->


<p> And Solomon had forty thousand brood mares for his chariots, and twelve thousand horses. And he reigned over all the kings from the river and to the land of the Philistines, and to the borders of Egypt: so Solomon the son of David reigned over Israel and Juda in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 Nevertheless the people burnt incense on the high places, because a house had not yet been built to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 And Solomon loved the Lord,   so as   to walk in the ordinances of David his father; only he sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 And he arose and went to Gabaon to sacrifice there, for that   was   the highest place, and great: Solomon offered a whole burnt offering of a thousand   victims   on the altar in Gabaon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 And the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and the Lord said to Solomon, Ask some petition for yourself.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 And Solomon said, You have dealt very mercifully with your servant David my father according as he walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you, and you have kept for him this great mercy, to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   give.  </span>  set his son upon his throne,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   as this day   is.     </span>  as   it is   this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 And now, O Lord my God, you have  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   given.  </span>  appointed your servant in the room of David my father; and I am a little child, and know not my going out an my coming in.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 But your servant   is   in the midst of your people, whom you have chosen, a great people, which as this day  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   shall   or   will not.  </span>  can’t be numbered.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 You shall give therefore to your servant a heart to hear and to judge your people justly, and to discern between good and evil: for who will be able to judge this your  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   heavy.  </span>  great people?  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 And it was pleasing before the Lord, that Solomon asked this thing.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 And the Lord said to him, Because you have asked this thing of me, and have not asked for yourself  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   many days.  </span>  long life, and have not asked wealth, nor have asked the lives of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to hear judgment;  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 behold, I have done according to your word: behold, I have given you an understanding and wise heart: there has not been   any one   like you before you, and after you there shall not arise one like you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 And I have given you what you have not asked, wealth and glory, so that there has not been any one like you among kings.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 And if you will walk in my way, to keep my commandments and my ordinances, as David your father walked, then will I multiply your days.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 And Solomon awoke, and, behold,   it was   a dream: and he arose and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   comes.  </span>  came to Jerusalem, and stood before the altar that was in front of the ark of the covenant of the Lord in Sion: and he offered whole burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings, and made a great banquet for himself and all his servants.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 Then there appeared two harlots before the king, and they stood before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 And the one woman said, Hear me,   my   lord; I and this woman lived in one house, and we were delivered in the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 And it came to pass on the third day after I was delivered, this woman also was delivered: and we   were   together; and there  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   is.  </span>  was no one with us besides our two selves in the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  019" id="3  019" >19</span>
 And this woman's child died in the night; because she  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   slept upon it.  </span>  overlaid it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  020" id="3  020" >20</span>
 and she arose in the middle of the night,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. and   Alex.+   'while your handmaid slept.'  </span>  and took my son from my arms, and laid him in her bosom, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   caused to sleep.  </span>  laid her dead son in my bosom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  021" id="3  021" >21</span>
 and I arose in the morning to suckle my son, and he was dead: and, behold, I considered him in the morning, and, behold, it was not my son whom I bore.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  022" id="3  022" >22</span>
 And the other woman said, No, but the living   is   my son, and the dead   is   your son. So they spoke before the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  023" id="3  023" >23</span>
 and the king said to them, You say, This   is   my son,   even   the living   one  , and this woman's son   is   the dead one: and you say, No, but the living   is   my son, and the dead   is   your son.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  024" id="3  024" >24</span>
 And the king said, Fetch a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  025" id="3  025" >25</span>
 And the king said, Divide the live child, the suckling, in two; and give half of it to one, and half of it to the other.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  026" id="3  026" >26</span>
 And the woman whose the living child was, answered and said to the king, (for her  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   her womb was troubled.  </span>  bowels yearned over her son) and she said, I pray you,   my   lord, give her the child, and in nowise kill it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor hers; divide   it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  027" id="3  027" >27</span>
 Then the king answered and said, Give the child to her that said, 'Give it to her, and by no means kill it:' she   is   its mother.  <span class="verse" rel="v0113  028" id="3  028" >28</span>
 and all Israel heard this judgment which the king judged, and they feared before the king; because they saw that the wisdom of God   was   in him, to execute judgment.

<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> And Chiram king of Tyre sent his servants to anoint Solomon in the room of David his father, because Chiram always loved David.  <span class="verse" rel="v0115  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 And Solomon sent to Chiram, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0115  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 You knew  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   that my father David, etc.  </span>  my father David, that he could not build a house to the name of the Lord my God  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from the face of.

 And now the Lord my God has given me rest round about; there is no one plotting against   me  , and there is no  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.   ἀπαντήμα.

 And, behold, I intend to build a house to the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord God spoke to my father David, saying, Your son whom I will set on your throne in your place, he shall build a house to my name.  <span class="verse" rel="v0115  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 And now command, and let   men   cut wood for me out of Libanus: and, behold, my servants   shall be   with your servants, and I will give you the wages of your service, according to all that you shall say, because you know that we have no one skilled in cutting timber like the Sidonians.  <span class="verse" rel="v0115  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 And it came to pass, as soon as Chiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed   be   God today, who has given to David a wise son over this numerous people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0115  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 And he sent to Solomon, saying, I have listened concerning all that you have sent to me for: I will do all your will:   as for   timber of cedar and fir,  <span class="verse" rel="v0115  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 my servants shall bring them down from Libanus to the sea: I will form them   into   rafts,   and bring them   to the place which you shall send to me   about  ; and I will  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   shake them off.  </span>  land them there, and you shall take   them   up: and you shall do my will, in giving bread to my household.  <span class="verse" rel="v0115  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 So Chiram gave to Solomon cedars, and fir trees, and all his desire.  <span class="verse" rel="v0115  011" id="5  011" >11</span>
 And Solomon gave to Chiram twenty thousand measures of wheat  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Some read μαχὰλ,   or   μαχὰθ, as if from מכרח   cibus. </span>  as food for his house, and twenty thousand baths of beaten oil thus Solomon gave to Chiram yearly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0115  012" id="5  012" >12</span>
 And the Lord gave wisdom to Solomon as he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   spoke to him.  </span>  promised him; and there was peace between Chiram and Solomon, and they made a covenant between them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0115  013" id="5  013" >13</span>
 And the king raised  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   tribute, etc.  </span>  a levy out of all Israel, and the levy was thirty thousand men.  <span class="verse" rel="v0115  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 And he sent them to Libanus, ten thousand taking turn every month: they were a month in Libanus and two months at home: and Adoniram   was   over the levy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0115  015" id="5  015" >15</span>
 And Solomon had seventy thousand bearers of burdens, and eighty thousand hewers of stone in the mountain;  <span class="verse" rel="v0115  016" id="5  016" >16</span>
 besides the rulers that were appointed over the works of Solomon,   there were   three thousand  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. 300.

<!-- 6   001 -->


<p> 18)    And the men of Solomon, and the men of Chiram hewed   the stones  , and laid them   for a foundation  . In the fourth year he laid the foundation of the house of the Lord, in the month Ziu, even in the second month. In the eleventh year, in the month Baal, this   is   the eighth month, the house was completed according to all its plan, and according to all its arrangement.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  002" id="6  002" >2</span>
 And the house which the king built to the Lord  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   its length forty in cubit, etc.  </span>    was    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. and   Alex.   60 cubits.  </span>  forty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and its height  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. and   Alex.   30 cubits.  </span>  five and twenty cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  003" id="6  003" >3</span>
 And the porch in front of the temple—twenty cubits   was   its length according to the breadth of the house in front of the house: and he built the house, and finished it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  004" id="6  004" >4</span>
 And he made to the house secret windows inclining inward.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  005" id="6  005" >5</span>
 And  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   upon.  </span>  against the wall of the house he set chambers round about  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. and   Alex.   with (or against) the walls of the house round about.  </span>  the temple and the ark.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  006" id="6  006" >6</span>
 The under side   was   five cubits broad, and the middle   part   six, and the third   was   seven cubits broad; for he formed an interval to the house round about without the house, that they might not touch the walls of the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  007" id="6  007" >7</span>
 And the house was built in the construction of it with rough hewn stones: and there was not heard in the house in the building of it hammer  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and.  </span>  or axe,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and.  </span>  or any iron tool.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  008" id="6  008" >8</span>
 And the porch of the under side   was   below the right wing of the house, and   there was   a winding ascent into the middle   chamber  , and from the middle to the third story.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  009" id="6  009" >9</span>
 So he built the house and finished it; and he made the ceiling of the house with cedars.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  10-14" id="6  10-14" >10-14</span>
 And he made the partitions through all the house, each five cubits high, and enclosed each partition with cedar boards.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  015" id="6  015" >15</span>
 And he framed the walls of the house within with cedar boards, from the floor of the house and on to the inner walls and to the beams: he lined the parts enclosed with boards within, and compassed the inward parts of the house with planks of fir.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  016" id="6  016" >16</span>
 And he built the twenty cubits from the top of the wall, one side from the floor to the beams, and he made it from the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   shrine.  </span>  oracle to the most holy place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  17-18" id="6  17-18" >17-18</span>
 And the temple was forty cubits   in extent  ,  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  019" id="6  019" >19</span>
 in front of the oracle in the midst of the house within,   in order   to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   give.  </span>  put there the ark of the covenant of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  020" id="6  020" >20</span>
 The length   was   twenty cubits, and the breadth   was   twenty cubits, and the height of it was twenty cubits. And he covered it with  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and   Heb. shut up.  </span>  perfect gold, and he made an altar in front of the oracle, and covered it with gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  21-22" id="6  21-22" >21-22</span>
 And he covered the whole house with gold,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to the finishing of the whole house.  </span>  till he had finished   gilding   the whole house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  023" id="6  023" >23</span>
 And he made in the oracle two cherubs of ten cubits measured size.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  024" id="6  024" >24</span>
 And the wing of one cherub was five cubits, and his other wing was five cubits; ten cubits  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from the tip of his wing to the tip of his wing.  </span>  from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other wing.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  025" id="6  025" >25</span>
 Thus it was with the other cherub, both were alike finished with one measure.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  026" id="6  026" >26</span>
 And the height of the one cherub   was   ten cubits, and so   was it   with the second cherub.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  027" id="6  027" >27</span>
 And both the cherubs   were   in the midst of the innermost part of the house; and they spread out their wings, and one wing touched the wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings in the midst of the house touched each other.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  028" id="6  028" >28</span>
 And he covered the cherubs with gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  029" id="6  029" >29</span>
 He graved all the walls of the house round about with the graving of cherubs, and   he sculptured   palm trees within and without   the house  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  030" id="6  030" >30</span>
 And he covered the floor of the house within and without with gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  31-33" id="6  31-33" >31-33</span>
 And for the door-way of the oracle he made doors of juniper wood,   there were   porches in a four-fold way.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  034" id="6  034" >34</span>
 In both the doors   were   planks of fir; the one door had two leaves and their hinges, and the other door had two leaves and turned   on hinges  ,  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  035" id="6  035" >35</span>
 being carved with cherubs, and   there were   palm-trees and open flower-leaves, and it   was   overlaid with gold gilt upon the engraving.  <span class="verse" rel="v0116  036" id="6  036" >36</span>
 And he built the inner court, three rows of  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See ch 10. 12.  </span>  hewn stones, and a row of wrought cedar round about, and he made the curtain of the court of the porch of the house that was in front of the temple.

 And he cast the two pillars for the porch of the house: eighteen cubits   was   the height of   each   pillar, and a circumference of fourteen cubits encompassed it, even the thickness of the pillar: the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   embossed   or   hollow work.  </span>  flutings   were   four fingers   wide  , and thus   was   the other pillar   formed  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0117  016" id="7  016" >16</span>

 and a chamber over both the pillars, and above the sides an addition   equal to   the chamber in width.  <span class="verse" rel="v0117  023" id="7  023" >23</span>

 According to the same form he made all the ten bases,   even   one order and one measure to all.  <span class="verse" rel="v0117  038" id="7  038" >38</span>
 And he made ten brazen lavers, each laver containing forty  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   gallons.

<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> And it came to pass when Solomon had finished building the house of the Lord and his own house after twenty years, then king Solomon assembled all the elders of Israel in Sion, to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, this is Sion,  <span class="verse" rel="v0118  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 in the month of Athanin.  <span class="verse" rel="v0118  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 And the priests took up the ark,  <span class="verse" rel="v0118  004" id="8  004" >4</span>
 and the tabernacle of testimony, and the holy furniture that was in the tabernacle of testimony.  <span class="verse" rel="v0118  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 And the king and all Israel   were occupied   before the ark, sacrificing sheep   and   oxen, without number.  <span class="verse" rel="v0118  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 And the priests bring in the ark into its place, into the oracle of the house, even into the holy of holies, under the wings of the cherubs.  <span class="verse" rel="v0118  007" id="8  007" >7</span>

 And the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. staves.  </span>  holy staves projected, and the ends of the holy staves appeared out of the holy places in front of the oracle, and were not seen without.  <span class="verse" rel="v0118  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 There was nothing in the ark except the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant which Moses put   there   in Choreb, which   tables   the Lord made   as a covenant   with the children of Israel in their going forth from the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v0118  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 And it came to pass when the priests departed out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0118  011" id="8  011" >11</span>
 And the priests could not stand to minister  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   before the cloud.  </span>  because of the cloud, because the glory of the Lord filled the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0118  014" id="8  014" >14</span>

 And the Lord has confirmed the word that he spoke, and I am risen up in the place of my father David, and I have sat down on the throne of Israel, as the Lord spoke, and I have built the house to the name of the Lord God of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0118  021" id="8  021" >21</span>

 And on the eighth day he sent away the people: and they blessed the king, and each departed to his  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   tabernacles.  </span>  tabernacle rejoicing, and   their   heart   was   glad because of the good things which the Lord had done to his servant David, and to Israel his people.

<p><span class="chapter" id="9  001">9  </span> And it came to pass when Solomon had finished building the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all the work of Solomon, whatever he wished to perform,  <span class="verse" rel="v0119  002" id="9  002" >2</span>
 that the Lord appeared to Solomon a second time, as he appeared in Gabaon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0119  003" id="9  003" >3</span>
 And the Lord said to him, I have heard the voice of your prayer, and your supplication which you made before me: I have done for you according to all your prayer: I have hallowed this house which you have built to put my name there for ever, and my eyes and my heart shall be there always.  <span class="verse" rel="v0119  004" id="9  004" >4</span>
 And if you will walk before me as David your father walked, in holiness of heart and uprightness, and so as to do according to all that I commanded him, and shall keep my ordinances and my commandments:  <span class="verse" rel="v0119  005" id="9  005" >5</span>
 then will I  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   raise up.  </span>  establish the throne of your kingdom in Israel for ever, as I spoke to David your father, saying, There shall not fail you a man to rule in Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0119  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
 But if you° or your children do in any wise revolt from me, and do not keep my commandments and my ordinances, which Moses  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   gave.  </span>  set before you, and you° go and serve other gods, and worship them:  <span class="verse" rel="v0119  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 then will I cut off Israel from the land which I have given them, and this house which I have consecrated to my name I will cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a desolation and a byword to all nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0119  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 And this house, which is high, shall be   so that   every one that passes  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   through it.  </span>  by it shall be amazed, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Therefore has the Lord done thus to this land, and to this house?  <span class="verse" rel="v0119  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 And   men   shall say, Because they forsook the Lord their God, who brought out their fathers from Egypt, out of the house of bondage, and they attached themselves to strange gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore the Lord has brought this evil upon them. Then Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharao out of the city of David into his house which he built for himself in those days.  <span class="verse" rel="v0119  010" id="9  010" >10</span>
    During   twenty years in which Solomon was building the two houses, the house of the Lord, and the house of the king,  <span class="verse" rel="v0119  011" id="9  011" >11</span>
 Chiram king of Tyre helped Solomon with cedar  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   woods.  </span>  wood, and fir  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   woods.  </span>  wood, and with gold, and all that he wished for: then the king gave Chiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.  <span class="verse" rel="v0119  012" id="9  012" >12</span>
 So Chiram departed from Tyre, and went into Galilee to see the cities which Solomon gave to him; and they pleased him not. And he said,  <span class="verse" rel="v0119  013" id="9  013" >13</span>
 What   are   these cities which you have given me, brother? And he called them Boundary until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0119  14-25" id="9  14-25" >14-25</span>
 And Chiram brought to Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold,  <span class="verse" rel="v0119  026" id="9  026" >26</span>
 even that for which king Solomon built a ship in Gasion Gaber near Aelath on the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   lip.  </span>  shore of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   last sea,   or   last part of the sea,   q.d.   head of the gulf.  </span>  extremity of the sea in the land of Edom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0119  027" id="9  027" >27</span>
 And Chiram sent in the ship together with the servants of Solomon servants of his own, mariners to row, men acquainted with the sea.  <span class="verse" rel="v0119  028" id="9  028" >28</span>
 And they came to Sophira, and took thence a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.

<p><span class="chapter" id="10  001">10  </span> And the queen of Saba heard of the name of Solomon, and the name of the Lord, and she came to try him with riddles.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  002" id="10  002" >2</span>
 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   force.  </span>  train; and   there came   camels bearing spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and she came in to Solomon, and told him all that was in her heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  003" id="10  003" >3</span>
 And Solomon  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   related to her all her words.  </span>  answered all her questions: and there was not a question overlooked by the king which he did not answer her.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  004" id="10  004" >4</span>
 And the queen of Saba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he built,  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  005" id="10  005" >5</span>
 and the provision of Solomon and the sitting of his attendants, and the standing of his servants, and his raiment, and his cupbearers, and his whole burnt offering which he offered in the house of the Lord, and she was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   in ecstasy.  </span>  utterly amazed.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  006" id="10  006" >6</span>

 But I believed not them that told me, until I came and my eyes saw: and, behold, the words as they reported to me are not the half: you have  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   added good things to them.  </span>  exceeded in goodness all the report which I heard in my land.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  008" id="10  008" >8</span>
 Blessed   are   your wives, blessed   are   these your servants who stand before you continually, who hear all your wisdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  009" id="10  009" >9</span>
 Blessed be the Lord your God, who has taken pleasure in you, to set you upon the throne of Israel, because the Lord loved Israel to establish   him   for ever; and he has made you king over them, to execute judgment with justice, and in their causes.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  010" id="10  010" >10</span>
 And she gave to Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and very many spices, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   precious stone.  </span>  precious stones: there had not come any other spices so abundant as those which the queen of Saba gave to king Solomon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  011" id="10  011" >11</span>
 And the ship of Chiram which brought the gold from Suphir, brought very much hewn timber and precious stones.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  012" id="10  012" >12</span>
 And the king made the hewn timber   into   buttresses of the house of the Lord and the king's house, and lyres and harps for singers: such hewn timber had not come upon the earth, nor have been seen anywhere until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  013" id="10  013" >13</span>
 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Saba all that she desired, whatever she asked, besides all that he had given her  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        of his royal bounty,   A.V. </span>  by the hand of king Solomon: and she returned, and came into her own land, she and her servants.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  014" id="10  014" >14</span>
 And the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  015" id="10  015" >15</span>
 Besides the tributes of them that were subjects, both merchants and all the kings of the   country   beyond   the river  , and of the princess of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  016" id="10  016" >16</span>
 And Solomon made three hundred spears of beaten gold: three hundred shekels of gold were upon one spear.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  017" id="10  017" >17</span>
 And three hundred  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   arms.  </span>  shields of beaten gold: and three pounds of gold were in one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  018" id="10  018" >18</span>
 And the king made a great ivory throne, and gilded it with pure gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  019" id="10  019" >19</span>
 The throne   had   six steps, and calves in bold relief to the throne behind it, and side-pieces on either hand of the place of the seat, and two lions standing by the side-pieces,  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  020" id="10  020" >20</span>
 and twelve lions standing there on the six steps on either side: it was not so done in any   other   kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  021" id="10  021" >21</span>
 And all the vessels made by Solomon   were   of gold, and the lavers   were   golden, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.

 For Solomon had a ship of Tharsis in the sea with the ships of Chiram: one ship came to the king every three years out of Tharsis,   laden with   gold and silver, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   turned.  </span>  wrought stones, and hewn stones.

<p> This was the arrangement of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        This word more commonly means 'spoil' in the O.T.  </span>  provision which king Solomon fetched to build the house of the Lord, and the house of the king, and the wall of Jerusalem, and the citadel; to fortify the city of David, and Assur, and Magdal, and Gazer, and Baethoron the upper, and Jethermath, and all the cities of the chariots, and all the cities of the horsemen, and the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   work.  </span>  fortification of Solomon which he purposed to build in Jerusalem and in all the land, so that none of the people should rule over him that was left of the Chettite and the Amorite, and the Pherezite, and the Chananite, and the Evite, and the Jebusite, and the Gergesite, who were not of the children of Israel, their descendants who had been left with him in the land, whom the children of Israel could not utterly destroy; and Solomon  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   reduced them to tribute.  </span>  made them tributaries until this day. But of the children of Israel Solomon made nothing; for they were the warriors, and his servants and rulers, and captains of the third order, and the captains of his chariots, and his horsemen.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  023" id="10  023" >23</span>
 And Solomon increased beyond all the kings of the earth in wealth and wisdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  024" id="10  024" >24</span>
 And all the kings of the earth sought the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   face.  </span>  presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom which the Lord   had   put into his heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  025" id="10  025" >25</span>
 And they brought every one their gifts, vessels of gold, and raiment, and stacte, and spices, and horses, and mules, a rate year by year.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  026" id="10  026" >26</span>
 And Solomon had four thousand mares for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen: and he put them in the cities of his chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem: and he ruled over all the kings from the river to the land of the Philistines, and to the borders of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  027" id="10  027" >27</span>
 And the king  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   gave.  </span>  made gold and silver in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as the sycamores in the plain for multitude.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  028" id="10  028" >28</span>
 And the goings forth of Solomon's horsemen   was   also out of Egypt, and the king's merchants   were   of Thecue; and they received them out of Thecue at a price.  <span class="verse" rel="v01110  029" id="10  029" >29</span>
 And that which proceeded out of Egypt went up   thus, even   a chariot for a hundred   shekels   of silver, and a horse for fifty   shekels   of silver: and thus for all the kings of the Chettians, and the kings of Syria, they came out by sea.

 And it came to pass in the time of the old age of Solomon, that his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as   was   the heart of David his father.  
<!-- 11   004 -->


<p> 3    And the strange women turned away his heart after their gods.   7    Then Solomon built a high place to Chamos the idol of Moab, and to their king the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See   Heb.  </span>  idol of the children of Ammon,

 And thus he acted towards all his strange wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their idols.

<p> 6    And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he went not after the Lord, as David his father.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  009" id="11  009" >9</span>
 And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because he turned away his heart from the Lord God of Israel, who had appeared twice to him,  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  010" id="11  010" >10</span>
 and charged him concerning this matter, by no means to go after other gods, but to take heed to do what the Lord God commanded him; neither was his heart perfect with the Lord, according to the heart of David his father.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  011" id="11  011" >11</span>
 And the Lord said to Solomon, Because it has been thus with you, and you have not kept my commandments and my ordinances which I commanded you, I will surely rend your kingdom out of your hand, and give it to your servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  012" id="11  012" >12</span>

 Only I will not take away the whole kingdom: I will give one tribe to your son for David my servant's sake, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  014" id="11  014" >14</span>
 And the Lord raised up an enemy to Solomon, Ader the Idumaean, and Esrom son of Eliadae who   lived   in Raama,   and   Adadezer king of Suba his master; (and men gathered to him, and he was head of the conspiracy, and he seized on Damasec,) and they were adversaries to Israel all the days of Solomon: and Ader the Idumaean   was   of the seed royal in Idumaea.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  015" id="11  015" >15</span>
 And it happened, that while David was utterly destroying Edom, while Joab captain of the host was going to bury the dead, when they killed every male in Idumaea;  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  016" id="11  016" >16</span>
 (for Joab and all Israel abode there six months in Idumaea, until he utterly destroyed every male in Idumaea;)  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  017" id="11  017" >17</span>
 that Ader ran away, he and all the Idumaeans of the servants of his father with him; and they went into Egypt; and Ader   was then   a little child.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  018" id="11  018" >18</span>
 And there rise up men out of the city of Madiam, and they come to Pharan, and take men with them, and come to Pharao king of Egypt: and Ader went in to Pharao, and he gave him a house, and appointed him provision.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  019" id="11  019" >19</span>
 And Ader found great favor in the sight of Pharao, and he gave him his wife's sister in marriage, the elder sister of Thekemina.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  020" id="11  020" >20</span>
 And the sister of Thekemina bore to him,   even   to Ader, Ganebath her son; and Thekemina brought him up in the midst of the sons of Pharao, and Ganebath was in the midst of the sons of Pharao.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  021" id="11  021" >21</span>
 And Ader heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead; and Ader said to Pharao, Let me go, and I will return to my country.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  022" id="11  022" >22</span>
 And Pharao said to Ader,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   wherein are you lacking?.  </span>  What lack you with me? that behold! you seek to depart to your country? and Ader said to him, By all means let me go.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  23-25" id="11  23-25" >23-25</span>
 So Ader returned to his country; this   is   the mischief which Ader did, and he was a bitter enemy of Israel, and he reigned in the land of Edom.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  026" id="11  026" >26</span>
 And Jeroboam the son of Nabat, the Ephrathite of Sarira, the son of a widow,   was   servant of Solomon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  027" id="11  027" >27</span>
 And this   was   the occasion  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   of his lifting.  </span>  of his lifting up   his   hands against king Solomon: now king Solomon built the citadel, he completed the fortification of the city of David his father.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  028" id="11  028" >28</span>
 And the man Jeroboam was very strong; and Solomon saw the young man that he was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a man of works.  </span>  active, and he set him over the levies of the house of Joseph.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  029" id="11  029" >29</span>
 And it came to pass at that time, that Jeroboam went forth from Jerusalem, and Achia the Selonite the prophet found him in the way, and caused him to turn aside out of the way: and Achia was clad with a new garment, and they  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   both.  </span>  two   were   alone in the field.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  030" id="11  030" >30</span>
 And Achia laid hold of his new garment that was upon him, and tore it   into   twelve pieces:  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  031" id="11  031" >31</span>
 and he said to Jeroboam, Take to yourself ten pieces, for thus says the Lord God of Israel, Behold, I rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give you ten  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   sceptres.

 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, (for I will certainly resist him all the days of his life,) for David my servant's sake, whom I have chosen.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  035" id="11  035" >35</span>

 But to his son I will give the two   remaining   tribes, that my servant David may have an establishment continually before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for myself to put my name there.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  037" id="11  037" >37</span>
 And I will take you, and you shall reign  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in all,   or   among all which, etc.  </span>  as your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  38-39" id="11  38-39" >38-39</span>
 And it shall come to pass, if you will keep all the commandments that I shall give you, and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right before me, to keep my ordinances and my commandments, as David my servant did, that I will be with you, and will build you a sure house, as I built to David.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  040" id="11  040" >40</span>
 And Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam: but he arose and fled into Egypt, to Susakim king of Egypt, and he was in Egypt until Solomon died.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  041" id="11  041" >41</span>
 And the rest of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   words.  </span>  history of Solomon, and all that he did, and all his wisdom, behold are not these things written in the book of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   words   or   things.  </span>  life of Solomon?  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  042" id="11  042" >42</span>
 And the days   during   which Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel   were   forty years.  <span class="verse" rel="v01111  043" id="11  043" >43</span>
 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David his father. And it came to pass when Jeroboam son of Nabat heard   of it  , even while he was yet in Egypt as he fled from the face of Solomon and lived in Egypt, he straightway comes into his own city, into the land of Sarira in the mount of Ephraim. And king Solomon slept with his fathers, and Roboam his son reigned in his stead.

 And the people spoke to king Roboam, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy;  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  004" id="12  004" >4</span>
 but do you now lighten somewhat of the hard service of your father, and of his heavy yoke which he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   gave.  </span>  put upon us, and we will serve you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  005" id="12  005" >5</span>
 And he said to them, Depart for three days, and return to me. And they departed.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  006" id="12  006" >6</span>
 And the king referred   the matter   to the elders, who stood before Solomon his father while he was yet living, saying, How do you° advise  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and I should answer a word, etc.  </span>  that I should answer this people?  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  007" id="12  007" >7</span>
 And they spoke to him, saying, If you will this day be a servant to this people, and will serve them, and will speak to them good words, then will they be your servants continually.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  008" id="12  008" >8</span>
 But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they gave him, and consulted with the young men who were brought up with him, who stood in his presence.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  009" id="12  009" >9</span>
 And he said to them, What counsel do you° give? And what shall I answer to this people who speak to me, saying, Lighten somewhat of the yoke which your father has put upon us?  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  010" id="12  010" >10</span>
 And the young men who had been brought up with him, who stood before his face, spoke to him, saying, Thus shall you say to this people who have spoken to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, and do you now lighten it from off us: thus shall say to them, My  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   littleness.  </span>  little   finger shall be   thicker than my father's loins.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  011" id="12  011" >11</span>

 And the king answered the people harshly; and Roboam forsook the counsel of the old men which they counselled him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  014" id="12  014" >14</span>
 And he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  015" id="12  015" >15</span>

 And all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them: and the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we any inheritance in the son of Jessae. Depart, O Israel, to your tents: now feed your own house, David. So Israel departed to his tents.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  018" id="12  018" >18</span>
 And the king sent Adoniram who was over the tribute; and they stoned him with stones, and he died: and king Roboam  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   prevented.  </span>  made haste to rise to flee to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  019" id="12  019" >19</span>
 So Israel  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   disowned   allegiance.  </span>  rebelled against the house of David until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  020" id="12  020" >20</span>
 And it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned out of Egypt, that they sent and called him to the assembly, and they made him king over Israel: and none followed the house of David except the tribe of Juda and Benjamin only.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  021" id="12  021" >21</span>
 And Roboam went into Jerusalem, and he assembled the congregation of Juda, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and twenty thousand young men, warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to recover the kingdom to Roboam the son of Solomon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  022" id="12  022" >22</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to Samaia the man of God, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  023" id="12  023" >23</span>
 Speak to Roboam the son of Solomon, king of Juda, and to all the house of Juda and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  024" id="12  024" >24</span>
 Thus says the Lord, You° shall not go up, neither shall you° fight with your brethren the sons of Israel: return each man to his own home; for this thing is from me; and they listened to the word of the Lord, and they ceased from going up, according to the word of the Lord.

<p> So king Solomon sleeps with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Roboam his son reigned in his stead in Jerusalem, being sixteen years old  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in his reigning.  </span>  when he began to reign, and he reigned twelve years I Jerusalem: and his mother's name   was   Naanan, daughter of Ana son of Naas king of the children of Ammon. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked not in the way of David his father.  
<!-- 12   024 -->


<p> And there was a man of mount Ephraim, a servant to Solomon, and his name was Jeroboam: and the name of his mother was Sarira, a harlot: and Solomon made him head of the levies of the house of Joseph: and he built for Solomon Sarira in mount Ephraim; and he had three hundred chariots of horses: he built the citadel with the levies of the house of Ephraim; he fortified the city of David, and aspired to the kingdom, And Solomon sought to kill him; and he was afraid, and escaped to Susakim king of Egypt, and was with him until Solomon died.  
<!-- 12   024 -->


<p> And Jeroboam heard in Egypt that Solomon was dead: and he spoke in the ears of Susakim king of Egypt, saying, Let me go, and I will depart into my land: and Susakim said to him, Ask and request, and I will grant it you. And Susakim gave to Jeroboam Ano the oldest sister of Thekemina his wife: she was great among the daughters of the king, and she bore to Jerobaom Abia his son: and Jeroboam said to Susakim, Let me indeed go, and I will depart.  
<!-- 12   024 -->


<p> And Jeroboam departed out of Egypt, and came into the land of Saria that was in mount Ephraim, and there the whole in mount Ephraim, and there the whole tribe of Ephraim assembles, and Jeroboam built a fortress there.  
<!-- 12   024 -->


<p> And his young child was sick with a very severe sickness; and Jeroboam went to enquire concerning the child: and he said to Ano his wife, Arise, go, enquire of God concerning the child, whether he shall  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   live.  </span>  recover from his sickness. Now there was a man in Selom, an his name   was   Achia: and he was sixty years old, and the word of the Lord was with him. And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, and take in your hand loaves for the man of God, and cakes for his children, and grapes, and a pot of honey. And the woman arose, and took in her hand bread, and two cakes, and grapes, and a pot of honey, for Achia: and the man   was   old, and his  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   were blunted from seeing.  </span>  eyes were dim, so that he could not see. And she arose, up from Sarira and went; and it came to pass when she had come into the city to Achia the Selonite, that Achia said to his servant, Go out now to meet Ano the wife of Jeroboam, and you shall say to her, Come in, and stand not   still  : for thus says the Lord, I send grievous tidings to you. And Ano went in to the man of God; and Achia said to her, Why have you brought me bread and grapes, and cakes, and a pot of honey? Thus says the Lord, Behold, you shall depart from me, and it shall come to pass when you have entered into the city,   even   into Sarira, that your maidens shall come out to meet you, and shall say to you, The child is dead: for thus says the Lord, Behold, I will destroy every male of Jeroboam, and there shall be the dead of Jeroboam in the city,   them   the dogs shall eat, and him that eat, and he shall lament for the child, saying,   Woe is me  , Lord! For there has been found in him some good thing touching the Lord.  
<!-- 12   024 -->


<p> And the woman departed, when she heard this: and it came to pass as she entered into Sarira, that the child died; and there came forth a wailing to meet   her  . And Jeroboam went to Sikima in mount Ephraim, and assembled there the tribes of Israel; and Roboam the son of Solomon went up there. And the word of the Lord came to Samaias son of Enlami, saying, Take to yourself a new garment which has not gone into the water, and rend it into twelve pieces; and you shall five some to Jeroboam, and shall say to him, thus says the Lord, Take to yourself ten pieces to cover you: and Jeroboam took   them  : and Samaias said, Thus says the Lord concerning the ten tribes of Israel.  
<!-- 12   024 -->


<p> And the people said to Roboam the son of Solomon, Your father make his yoke heavy upon us, and made the meat of his table heavy; and now you shall lighten them upon us, and we will serve you. And Roboam said to the people, Wait three days, and I will return you an answer: and Roboam said, Bring in to me the elders, and I will take counsel with them what I shall answer to the people on the third day, So Roboam spoke in their ears, as the people sent to him to   say  : and the elders of the people said, Thus the people have spoken to you.  
<!-- 12   024 -->


<p> And Roboam  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   dispersed.  </span>  rejected their counsel, and it pleased him not: and he sent and brought in those who had been brought up with him; and he said to them, Thus and thus has the people sent to me to say: and they that had been brought up with him said, Thus shall you speak to the people saying, My  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   littleness.  </span>  little   finger   shall be thicker than my father's loins; my father scourged you with whips, but I will rule you with scorpions.  
<!-- 12   024 -->


<p> And the saying pleased Roboam, and he answered the people as the young men, they that were brought up with him, counselled him: and all the people spoke as one man, every one to his neighbor, and they cried out all together, saying, We have no part in David, nor inheritance in the son of Jessae: to they tents, O Israel, every one; for this man is not for a prince or a ruler over us. And all the people was dispersed from Sikima, and they departed every one to his tent: and Roboam strengthened him self and departed, and mounted his chariot, and entered into Jerusalem: and there follow him the whole tribe of Juda, and the whole tribe of Benjamin. And it came to pass at the beginning of the year, that Roboam gathered all the men of Juda and Benjamin, and went up to fight with Jeroboam at Sikima. And the word of the Lord came to Sameas the man of God, saying, Speak to Roboam king of Juda, and to all the house of Juda and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying, Thus says the Lord, You° shall not go up, neither shall you° fight with your brethren the sons of Israel: return every man to his house, for this thing is from me. And they listened to the word of the Lord, and forbore to go up, according to the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  025" id="12  025" >25</span>
 And Jeroboam built Sikima in mount Ephraim and lived in it, and went forth thence and built Phanuel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  026" id="12  026" >26</span>
 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Behold, now the kingdom will return to the house of David.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  027" id="12  027" >27</span>
 If this people shall go up to offer sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, then the heart of the people will return to the Lord, and to their master, to Roboam king of Juda, and they will kill me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  028" id="12  028" >28</span>
 And the king took counsel, and went, and made two golden heifers, and said to the people, Let it suffice you  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to go.  </span>  to have gone   hitherto   to Jerusalem: behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  029" id="12  029" >29</span>
 And he put one in Bethel, and he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   gave.  </span>  put the other in Dan.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  030" id="12  030" >30</span>
 And this thing became a sin; and the people went before one as far as Dan, and left the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  031" id="12  031" >31</span>
 And he made houses on the high places, and made priests of any part of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  032" id="12  032" >32</span>
 And Jeroboam appointed a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, according to the feast in the land of Juda;  <span class="verse" rel="v01112  033" id="12  033" >33</span>
 and went up to the altar which he made in Baethel to sacrifice to the heifers which he made, and he placed in Baethel the priests of the high places which he had made. And he went up to the altar which he had made, on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, at the feast which he devised out of his own heart; and he made a feast to the children of Israel, and went up to the altar to sacrifice.  
<!-- 13   033 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="13  001">13  </span> And behold, there came a man of God out of Juda by the word of the Lord to Baethel, and Jeroboam stood at the altar to sacrifice.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  002" id="13  002" >2</span>
 And he cried against the altar by the word of the Lord, and said, O altar, altar, thus says the Lord, Behold, a son is   to be   born to the house of David,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   Josias the name to him.  </span>  Josias by name; and he shall offer upon you the priests of the high places,   even   of them that sacrifice upon you, and   he   shall burn men's bones upon you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  003" id="13  003" >3</span>
 And in that day one shall give a sign, saying, This   is   the word which the Lord has spoken, saying, Behold, the altar is tore, and the fatness upon it shall be poured out.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  004" id="13  004" >4</span>
 And it came to pass when king Jeroboam heard the words of the man of God who called on the altar that was in Baethel, that the king stretched forth his hand from the altar, saying, Take hold of him. And, behold, his hand, which he stretched forth against him, withered, and he could not draw it back to himself.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  005" id="13  005" >5</span>
 And the altar was tore, and the fatness was poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God gave by the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  006" id="13  006" >6</span>
 And king Jeroboam said to the man of God, Intreat the Lord your God, and let my hand  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   return to me.  </span>  be restored to me. And the man of God entreated the Lord, and he restored the king's hand to him, and it became as before.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  007" id="13  007" >7</span>
 And the king said to the man of God, Enter with me into the house, and dine, and I will give you a gift.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  008" id="13  008" >8</span>
 And the man of God said to the king, If you should give me the half of your house, I  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   will not.  </span>  would not go in with you, neither will I eat bread, neither will I drink water in this place; for thus the Lord charged me by   his   word, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  009" id="13  009" >9</span>
 Eat no bread, and drink no water, and return not by the way by which you came.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  010" id="13  010" >10</span>
 So he departed by another way, and returned not by the way by which he came to Baethel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  011" id="13  011" >11</span>
 And there lived an old prophet in Baethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God did on that day in Baethel, and the words which he spoke to the king: and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Wide variation from the Hebrew.  </span>  they turned the face of their father.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  012" id="13  012" >12</span>
 And their father spoke to them, saying, Which way went he? and his sons show him the way by which the man of God who came out of Juda went up.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  013" id="13  013" >13</span>
 And he said to his sons, Saddle me the ass: and they saddled him the ass, and he mounted it,  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  014" id="13  014" >14</span>
 and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said to him, Are you the man of God that came out of Juda? And he said to him, I   am  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  015" id="13  015" >15</span>
 And he said to him, Come with me, and eat bread.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  016" id="13  016" >16</span>
 And he said, I shall not by any means be able to return with you, neither will I eat bread, neither will I drink water in this place.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  017" id="13  017" >17</span>
 For thus the Lord commanded me by word, saying, Eat not bread there, and drink not water, and return not there by the way by which you came.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  018" id="13  018" >18</span>
 And he said to him, I also am a prophet as you   are  ; and an angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back to you into your house, and let him eat bread and drink water: but he lied to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  019" id="13  019" >19</span>
 And he brought him back, and he ate bread and drank water in his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  020" id="13  020" >20</span>
 And it came to pass while they were sitting at the table, that the word of the Lord came to the prophet that brought him back;  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  021" id="13  021" >21</span>
 and he spoke to the man of God that came out of Juda, saying, Thus says the Lord, Because you have  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   embittered.  </span>  resisted the word of the Lord, and have not kept the commandment which the Lord your God commanded you,  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  022" id="13  022" >22</span>
 but have returned, and eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he spoke to you, saying, You shall not eat bread, and shall not drink water;   therefore   your body shall in nowise enter into the sepulchre of your fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  023" id="13  023" >23</span>
 And it came to pass after he had eaten bread and drunk water, that he saddled the ass for him, and he turned and departed.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  024" id="13  024" >24</span>
 And a lion found him in the way, and killed him; and his body was cast out in the way, and the ass was standing by it, and the lion   also   was standing by the body.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  025" id="13  025" >25</span>
 And, behold, men   were   passing by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion was standing near the carcase: and they went in and spoke   of it   in the city where the old prophet lived.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  026" id="13  026" >26</span>
 And   the prophet   that turned him back out of the way heard, and said, This is the man of God who rebelled against the word of the Lord.  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Vat.   has no verse 27.

    And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass, and they saddled it.     <span class="verse" rel="v01113  028" id="13  028" >28</span>
 And he went and found the body cast in the way, and the ass and the lion were standing by the body: and the lion had not devoured the body of the man of God, and had not torn the ass.  <span class="verse" rel="v01113  029" id="13  029" >29</span>

<p> And king Josaphat made a ship  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   for.  </span>  at Tharsis to go to Sophir for gold: but it went not, for the ship was broken at Gasion Gaber. Then the king of Israel said to Josaphat,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   let me.  </span>  I will send forth your servants and my servants in the ship: but Josaphat would not. And Josaphat slept with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Joram his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01116  029" id="16  029" >29</span>
 In the second year of Josaphat king of Juda, Achaab son of Ambri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.  <span class="verse" rel="v01116  030" id="16  030" >30</span>
 And Achaab did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and did more wickedly than all that were before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01116  031" id="16  031" >31</span>
 And it was not enough for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, but he took as wife, Jezabel the daughter of Jethebaal king of the Sidonians; and he went and served Baal, and worshipped him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01116  032" id="16  032" >32</span>
 And he set up an altar to Baal, in the house of his  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   provocations, etc.  </span>  abominations, which he built in Samaria.  <span class="verse" rel="v01116  033" id="16  033" >33</span>
 And Achaab made a grove; and Achaab did yet more abominably, to provoke the Lord God of Israel, and   to sin against   his own life so that he should be destroyed: he did evil above all the kings of Israel that were before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01116  034" id="16  034" >34</span>
 And in his days Achiel the Baethelite built Jericho: he laid the foundation of it in Abiron his firstborn, and he set up the doors of it in Segub his younger son, according to the word of the Lord which he spoke by Joshua the son of Naue.

<p><span class="chapter" id="17  001">17  </span> And Eliu the prophet, the Thesbite of Thesbae of Galaad, said to Achaab, As the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   if there shall be, etc.  </span>  there shall not be these years dew nor rain, except by the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   mouth of my word.  </span>  word of my mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  002" id="17  002" >2</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to Eliu,   saying  ,  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  003" id="17  003" >3</span>
 Depart hence eastward, and hide you  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in.  </span>  by the brook of Chorrath, that is before Jordan.  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  004" id="17  004" >4</span>
 And it shall be   that   you shall drink water of the brook, and I will charge the ravens to feed you there.  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  005" id="17  005" >5</span>
 And Eliu did according to the word of the Lord, and he sat by the brook of Chorrath before Jordan.  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  006" id="17  006" >6</span>
 And the ravens brought him loaves in the morning, and flesh in the evening and he drank water of the brook.  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  007" id="17  007" >7</span>
 And it came to pass after  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   days.  </span>  some time, that the brook was dried up, because there had been no rain upon the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  008" id="17  008" >8</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to Eliu,   saying  ,  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  009" id="17  009" >9</span>
 Arise, and go to Sarepta of the Sidonian   land  : behold, I have there commanded a widow-woman to maintain you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  010" id="17  010" >10</span>
 And he arose and went to Sarepta, and came to the gate of the city: and, behold, a widow-woman was there gathering sticks; and Eliu cried after her, and said to her,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   take etc. into.  </span>  Fetch me, I pray you, a little water in a vessel,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and I will etc.  </span>  that I may drink.  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  011" id="17  011" >11</span>
 And she went to fetch it; and Eliu cried after her, and said, Bring me, I pray you, a morsel of the bread that is in your hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  012" id="17  012" >12</span>
 And the woman said,   As   the Lord your God lives, I have not a cake, but only a handful of meal in the pitcher, and a little oil in a cruse, and, behold, I am going to gather two sticks, and I shall go in and dress it for myself and my children, and we shall eat it and die.  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  013" id="17  013" >13</span>
 And Eliu said to her, Be of good courage, go in and do according to your word: but make me thereof a little cake, and you shall bring   it   out to me first, and you shall make   some   for yourself and your children last.  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  014" id="17  014" >14</span>
 For thus says the Lord, The pitcher of meal shall not fail, and the cruse of oil shall not  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   be diminished, or fail of, etc.  </span>  diminish, until the day that the Lord gives rain upon the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  015" id="17  015" >15</span>
 And the woman went and did   so  , and did eat, she, and he, and her children.  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  016" id="17  016" >16</span>
 And the pitcher of meal failed not, and the cruse of oil was not diminished, according to the word of the Lord which he spoke by the hand of Eliu.  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  017" id="17  017" >17</span>
 And it came to pass afterward, that the son of the woman the mistress of the house was sick; and his sickness was very severe, until there was no breath left in him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  018" id="17  018" >18</span>
 And she said to Eliu, What have I to do with you, O man of God? have you come in to me to bring my sins to remembrance, and to kill my son?  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  019" id="17  019" >19</span>
 And Eliu said to the woman, Give me your son. And he took him out of her bosom, and took him up to the chamber in which he himself lodged, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   caused him to sleep.  </span>  laid him on the bed.  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  020" id="17  020" >20</span>
 And Eliu cried aloud, and said, Alas, O Lord, the witness of the widow with whom I sojourn, you have wrought evil   for her   in slaying her son.  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  021" id="17  021" >21</span>
 And he breathed on the child thrice, and called on the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, let, I pray you, the soul of this child return to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  022" id="17  022" >22</span>
 And it was so, and the child cried out,  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  023" id="17  023" >23</span>
 and he brought him down from the upper chamber into the house, and gave him to his mother; and Eliu said, See, your son lives.  <span class="verse" rel="v01117  024" id="17  024" >24</span>
 And the woman said to Eliu, Behold, I know that you   are   a man of God, and the word of the Lord in your mouth   is   true.

<p><span class="chapter" id="18  001">18  </span> And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the Lord came to Eliu in the third year, saying, Go, and appear before Achaab, and I will bring rain upon the face of the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  002" id="18  002" >2</span>
 And Eliu went to appear before Achaab: and the famine   was   severe in Samaria.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  003" id="18  003" >3</span>
 And Achaab called Abdiu the steward. Now Abdiu feared the Lord greatly.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  004" id="18  004" >4</span>
 And it came to pass when Jezabel struck the prophets of the Lord, that Abdiu took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  005" id="18  005" >5</span>
 And Achaab said to Abdiu, Come, and let us go through the land, and to the fountains of water, and to the brooks, if by any means we may find grass, and may save the horses and mules, and so they will not perish from the tents.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  006" id="18  006" >6</span>
 And they made a division of the way between them to pass through it: Achaab went one way, and Abdiu went by another way alone.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  007" id="18  007" >7</span>
 And Abdiu was alone in the way; and Eliu came alone to meet him: and Abdiu hasted, and fell upon his face, and said, My lord Eliu,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   if you are, etc.  </span>  are you   indeed   he?  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  008" id="18  008" >8</span>
 And Eliu said to him, I   am  : go say to your master, Behold, Eliu   is here  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  009" id="18  009" >9</span>
 And Abdiu said, What sin have I committed, that you give your servant into the hand of Achaab to kill me?  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  010" id="18  010" >10</span>
    As   the Lord your God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom, whither my lord has not sent to seek you; and if they said, He is not   here  , then has he set fire to the kingdom and its territories, because he has not found you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  011" id="18  011" >11</span>
 And now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Eliu   is here  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  012" id="18  012" >12</span>
 And it shall come to pass when I shall have departed from you, that the Spirit of the Lord shall carry you to a land which I know not, and I shall go in to tell the matter to Achaab, and he will not find you and will kill me: yet your servant fears the Lord from his youth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  013" id="18  013" >13</span>
 Has it not been told to you my lord, what I did when Jezabel killed the prophets of the Lord, that I hid a hundred men of the prophets of the Lord, by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  014" id="18  014" >14</span>
 And now you say to me, Go, say to your master, Behold, Eliu   is here  : and he shall kill me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  015" id="18  015" >15</span>
 And Eliu said,   As   the Lord of Hosts before whom I stand lives, today I will appear before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  016" id="18  016" >16</span>
 And Abdiu went to meet Achaab, and told him: and Achaab  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   ran forth.  </span>  hasted forth, and went to meet Eliu.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  017" id="18  017" >17</span>
 And it came to pass when Achaab saw Eliu, that Achaab said to Eliu, Are you he that perverts Israel?  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  018" id="18  018" >18</span>
 And Eliu said, I do not pervert Israel; but it is you and your father's house, in that you° forsake the Lord your God, and you have gone after Baalim.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  019" id="18  019" >19</span>
 And now send, gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. Baal. See Jer. 11. 13. Hos. 9. 10.  </span>  shame four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, that eat   at   Jezabel's table.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  020" id="18  020" >20</span>
 And Achaab sent to all Israel, and gathered all the prophets to mount Carmel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  021" id="18  021" >21</span>
 And Eliu drew near to them all: and Eliu said to them, How long will you° halt on both  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the hams, from γόνν, the knee.  </span>  feet? if the Lord be God, follow him; but if Baal, follow him. And the people answered not a word.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  022" id="18  022" >22</span>
 And Eliu said to the people, I am left, the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   quite alone.  </span>  only one prophet of the Lord; and the prophets of Baal   are   four hundred and fifty men, and the prophets of the groves four hundred.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  023" id="18  023" >23</span>
 Let them give us two oxen, and let them choose one for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire   on   the wood: and I will dress the other bullock, and put on no fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  024" id="18  024" >24</span>
 And do you° call loudly on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord my God, and it shall come to pass that the God who shall answer by fire, he   is   God. And all the people answered and said, The word which you have spoken   is   good.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  025" id="18  025" >25</span>
 And Eliu said to the prophets of shame, Choose to yourselves one calf, and dress it first, for you°   are   many; and call you° on the name of your god; but apply no fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  026" id="18  026" >26</span>
 And they took the calf and dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning till noon, and said, hear us, O Baal, hear us. And there was no voice, neither was there hearing, and they ran up and down on the altar which they   had   made.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  027" id="18  027" >27</span>
 And it was noon, and Eliu the Thesbite mocked them, and said, Call with a loud voice, for he is a god; for he is meditating, or else perhaps he is  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   preparing an answer.  </span>  engaged in business, or perhaps he is asleep, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   will awake or arise.  </span>  is to be awaked.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  028" id="18  028" >28</span>
 And they cried with a loud voice, and cut themselves according to their custom with knives and lancets until the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   shedding of blood upon them.  </span>  blood gushed out upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  029" id="18  029" >29</span>
 And they prophesied until the evening came; and it came to pass as it was the time of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the sacrifice going up.  </span>  offering of the sacrifice, that Eliu the Thesbite spoke to the prophets of the abominations, saying, Stand by for the present, and I will offer my sacrifice. And they stood aside and departed.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  030" id="18  030" >30</span>
 And Eliu said to the people, Come near to me. And all the people came near to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  031" id="18  031" >31</span>
 And Eliu took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of Israel, as the Lord spoke to him, saying, Israel shall be your name.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  032" id="18  032" >32</span>
 And he built up the stones in the name of the Lord, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   healed.  </span>  repaired the altar that had been broken down; and he made a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   sea.  </span>  trench that would hold two measures of seed round about the altar.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  033" id="18  033" >33</span>
 And he piled the cleft wood on the altar which he   had   made, and divided the whole burnt offering, and laid   it   on the wood, and laid   it   in order on the altar, and said, Fetch me four pitchers of water, and pour   it   on the whole burnt offering, and on the wood. And they did so.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  034" id="18  034" >34</span>
 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  035" id="18  035" >35</span>
 And the water ran round about the altar, and they filled the trench with water.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  036" id="18  036" >36</span>
 And Eliu cried aloud to the heaven, and said, Lord God of Abraam, and Isaac, and Israel, answer me, O Lord,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   listen to me.  </span>  answer me this day by fire, and let all this people know that you are the Lord, the God of Israel, and I   am   your servant, and for your sake I have wrought these works.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  037" id="18  037" >37</span>
 Hear me, O Lord, hear me, and let this people know that you are the Lord God, and you have turned back the heart of this people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  038" id="18  038" >38</span>
 Then fire fell from the Lord out of heaven, and devoured the whole burnt offerings, and the wood and the water that was in the trench, and the fire licked up the stones and the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  039" id="18  039" >39</span>
 And all the people fell upon their faces, and said, Truly the Lord   is   God; he   is   God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  040" id="18  040" >40</span>
 And Eliu said to the people, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them; and Eliu brings them down to the brook Kisson, and he killed them there.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  041" id="18  041" >41</span>
 And Eliu said to Achaab, Go up, and eat and drink, for   there is   a sound of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   feet of rain.  </span>  coming of rain.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  042" id="18  042" >42</span>
 And Achaab went up to eat and to drink; and Eliu went up to Carmel, and stooped to the ground, and put his face between his knees,  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  043" id="18  043" >43</span>
 and said to his servant, Go up, and look toward the sea. And the servant looked, and said, There is nothing: and Eliu said, Do you then go again seven times.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  044" id="18  044" >44</span>
 And the servant went again seven times: and it came to pass at the seventh time, that, behold, a little cloud like the sole of a man's foot  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   bringing.  </span>  brought water; and he said, Go up, and say to Achaab, make ready your chariot, and go down, lest the rain overtake you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  045" id="18  045" >45</span>
 And it came to pass in the meanwhile, that the heaven grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Achaab wept, and went to Jezrael.  <span class="verse" rel="v01118  046" id="18  046" >46</span>
 And the hand of the Lord   was   upon Eliu, and he girded up his loins, and ran before Achaab to Jezrael.

<p><span class="chapter" id="19  001">19  </span> And Achaab told Jezabel his wife all that Eliu   had   done, and how he   had   slain the prophets with the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v01119  002" id="19  002" >2</span>
 And Jezabel sent to Eliu, and said, If you are Eliu and I am Jezabel, God  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   do these things to me, and add these things.  </span>  do so to me, and more also, if I do not make your life by this time to-morrow as the life of one of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01119  003" id="19  003" >3</span>
 And Eliu feared, and rose, and departed for his life: and he comes to Bersabee   to   the land of Juda, and he left his servant there.  <span class="verse" rel="v01119  004" id="19  004" >4</span>
 And he himself went a day's journey in the wilderness, and came and sat under a juniper tree; and asked concerning his life that he might die, and said, Let it be enough now, O Lord, take, I pray you, my life from me; for I am no better than my fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v01119  005" id="19  005" >5</span>

 And the angel of the Lord returned again, and touched him, and said to him, Arise, and eat, for the journey   is   far from you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01119  008" id="19  008" >8</span>
 And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights to mount Choreb.  <span class="verse" rel="v01119  009" id="19  009" >9</span>
 And he entered there into a cave, and rested there; and, behold, the word of the Lord   came   to him, and he said, What   do   you here, Eliu?  <span class="verse" rel="v01119  010" id="19  010" >10</span>
 And Eliu said,          Rom 11:3    I have been very jealous for the Lord Almighty, because the children of Israel have forsaken you: they have digged down your altars, and have slain your prophets with the sword; and I only am left alone, and they seek my life to take it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01119  011" id="19  011" >11</span>
 And he said, You shall go forth to-morrow, and shall stand before the Lord in the mount; behold, the Lord will pass by. And, behold, a great   and   strong wind rending the mountains, and crushing the rocks before the Lord;   but   the Lord   was   not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake;   but   the Lord   was   not in the earthquake:  <span class="verse" rel="v01119  012" id="19  012" >12</span>
 and after the earthquake a fire;   but   the Lord   was   not in the fire: and after the fire the voice of a gentle breeze.  <span class="verse" rel="v01119  013" id="19  013" >13</span>
 And it came to pass when Eliu heard, that he wrapt his face in his mantle, and went forth and stood in the cave: and, behold, a voice   came   to him and said, What   do   you here, Eliu?  <span class="verse" rel="v01119  014" id="19  014" >14</span>
 And Eliu said, I have been very jealous for the Lord Almighty; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, and they have overthrown your altars, and have slain your prophets with the sword! and I am left entirely alone, and they seek my life to take it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01119  015" id="19  015" >15</span>
 And the Lord said to him, Go, return, and you shall come into the way of the wilderness of Damascus: and you shall go and anoint Azael to be king over Syria.  <span class="verse" rel="v01119  016" id="19  016" >16</span>
 And Ju the son of Namessi shall you anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisaie the son of Saphat shall you anoint to be prophet in your room.  <span class="verse" rel="v01119  017" id="19  017" >17</span>
 And it shall come to pass, that him that escapes from the sword of Azael, Ju shall kill; and him that escapes from the sword of Ju, Elisaie shall kill.  <span class="verse" rel="v01119  018" id="19  018" >18</span>
 And you shall leave in Israel seven thousand men, all the knees which had not bowed  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the knee.  </span>  themselves to Baal, and every mouth which had not worshipped him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01119  019" id="19  019" >19</span>
 And he departed thence, and finds Elisaie the son of Saphat, and he was plowing with oxen;   there were   twelve yoke before him, and he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in.  </span>  with the twelve, and he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   departed.  </span>  passed by to him, and cast his mantle upon him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01119  020" id="19  020" >20</span>
 And Elisaie left the cattle, and ran after Eliu and said, I will kiss my father, and follow after you. And Eliu said, Return, for I have done   a work   for you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01119  021" id="19  021" >21</span>
 And he returned  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from behind him.  </span>  from following him, and took  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the yokes.  </span>  a yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled them with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate: and he arose, and went after Eliu, and ministered to him.

<p><span class="chapter" id="20  001">20  </span> And Nabuthai the Jezraelite had a vineyard, near the threshing floor of Achaab king of Samaria.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  002" id="20  002" >2</span>
 And Achaab spoke to Nabuthai, saying, Give me your vineyard, and I will have it for a garden of herbs, for it   is   near my house: and I will give you another vineyard better than it; or if  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   it is pleasing before you.  </span>  it please you, I will give you money, the price of this your vineyard, and I will have it for a garden of herbs.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  003" id="20  003" >3</span>
 And Nabuthai said to Achaab, My God forbid me that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  004" id="20  004" >4</span>
 And the spirit of Achaab was troubled, and he lay down upon his bed, and covered his face, and ate no bread.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  005" id="20  005" >5</span>
 And Jezabel his wife went in to him, and spoke to him,   saying  , Why   is   your spirit troubled, and   why   do you eat no bread?  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  006" id="20  006" >6</span>
 And he said to her, Because I spoke to Nabuthai the Jezraelite, saying, Give me your vineyard for money; or if you will, I will give you another vineyard for it: and he said, I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  007" id="20  007" >7</span>
 And Jezabel his wife said to him, Do you now thus act the king over Israel? arise, and eat bread, and be  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   like yourself.  </span>  your own   master  , and I will give you the vineyard of Nabuthai the Jezraelite.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  008" id="20  008" >8</span>
 And she wrote a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   book.  </span>  letter in the name of Achaab, and sealed it with his seal, and sent the letter to the elders, and to the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Possibly nobles is here meant.  </span>  freemen who lived with Nabuthai.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  009" id="20  009" >9</span>
 And  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   had been written.  </span>  it was written in the letters, saying, Keep a fast, and set Naboth in a chief place among the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  010" id="20  010" >10</span>
 And set two men, sons of transgressors, before him, and let them testify against him, saying, He  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See   Prof. Lee   on the word ברך in Job 2. 9.   Heb. Gram. p.92.  </span>  blessed God and the king: and let them lead him forth, and stone him, and let them die.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  011" id="20  011" >11</span>
 And the men of his city, the elders, and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezabel sent to them, and as it had been written in the letters which she sent to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  012" id="20  012" >12</span>
 And they  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   called.  </span>  proclaimed a fast, and set Nebuthai in a chief place among the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  013" id="20  013" >13</span>
 And two men, sons of transgressors, came in, and sat opposite him, and bore witness against him, saying, You have blessed God and the king. And they led him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, and he died.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  014" id="20  014" >14</span>
 And they sent to Jezabel, saying, Nabuthai is stoned, and is dead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  015" id="20  015" >15</span>
 And it came to pass, when Jezabel heard   it  , that she said to Achaab, Arise,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   inherit.  </span>  take possession of the vineyard of Nabuthai the Jezraelite, who  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   sold it not.  </span>  would not sell it to you: for Nebuthai is not alive, for he is dead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  016" id="20  016" >16</span>
 And it came to pass, when Achaab heard that Nabuthai the Jezraelite was dead, that he tore his garments, and put on sackcloth. And it came to pass afterward, that Achaab arose and went down to the vineyard of Nabuthai the Jezraelite,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to inherit it.  </span>  to take possession of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  017" id="20  017" >17</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Eliu the Thesbite, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  018" id="20  018" >18</span>
 Arise, and go down to meet Achaab king of Israel, who is in Samaria, for he   is   in the vineyard of Nabuthai, for he has gone down there to take possession of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  019" id="20  019" >19</span>
 And you shall speak to him, saying,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   these things.  </span>  Thus says the Lord, Forasmuch as you have slain and taken possession, therefore thus says the Lord, In every place where the swine and the dogs have licked the blood of Nabuthai, there shall the dogs lick your blood; and the harlots shall wash themselves in your blood.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  020" id="20  020" >20</span>
 And Achaab said to Eliu, Hast you found me, my enemy? and he said, I have found   you  : because you have  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   foolishly,   or   in vain.  </span>  wickedly sold yourself to work evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger;  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  021" id="20  021" >21</span>
 behold, I bring  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   evils.  </span>  evil upon you: and I will kindle a fire after you, and I will utterly destroy every male of Achaab, and him that is shut up and him that is left in Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  022" id="20  022" >22</span>
 And I will  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   give.  </span>  make your house as the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and as the house of Baasa son of Achia, because of the provocations wherewith you have provoked   me  , and caused Israel to sin.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  023" id="20  023" >23</span>
 And the Lord spoke  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   to Jezabel.  </span>  of Jezabel, saying, The dogs shall devour her  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   by.  </span>  within the fortification of Jezrael.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  024" id="20  024" >24</span>
 Him that is dead of Achaab in the city shall the dogs eat, and him that is dead of him in the field shall the birds of the sky eat.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  025" id="20  025" >25</span>
 But Achaab   did   wickedly,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   who sold, etc.  </span>  in that he sold himself to do that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his wife Jezabel led him astray.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  026" id="20  026" >26</span>
 And he did very abominably in following after the abominations, according to all that the Amorite did, whom the Lord utterly destroyed from before the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  027" id="20  027" >27</span>
 And because of the word, Achaab was pierced with sorrow  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the face, as it were, of the Lord.  </span>  before the Lord, and he both went weeping, and tore his garment, and girded sackcloth upon his body, and fasted; he put on sackcloth also in the day that he struck Nabuthai the Jezraelite, and went his way.  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  028" id="20  028" >28</span>
 And the word of the Lord came by the hand of his servant Eliu concerning Achaab, and the Lord said,  <span class="verse" rel="v01120  029" id="20  029" >29</span>
 Hast you seen how Achaab has been pricked   to the heart   before me? I will not bring on the evil in his days, but in his son's days will I bring on the evil.

<p><span class="chapter" id="21  001">21  </span> And the son of Ader gathered all his forces, and went up and besieged Samaria,   he   and thirty-two kings with him, and all   his   horse and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   chariot.  </span>  chariots: and they went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  002" id="21  002" >2</span>
 And he sent into the city to Achaab king of Israel, and said to him, Thus says the son of Ader,  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  003" id="21  003" >3</span>
 Your silver and your gold are mine, and your wives and your children are mine.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  004" id="21  004" >4</span>
 And the king of Israel answered and said, As you have said, my lord, O king, I am yours, and all mine   also  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  005" id="21  005" >5</span>
 And the messengers came again, and said, Thus says the son of Ader, I sent to you, saying, You shall give me your silver and your gold, and your wives and your children.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  006" id="21  006" >6</span>
 For at this time to-morrow I will send my servants to you, and they shall search your house, and the houses of your servants, and it shall be that all the desirable objects of their eyes on which they shall lay their hands, they shall even take   them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  007" id="21  007" >7</span>
 And the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Take notice now and consider, that this man seeks mischief: for he has sent to me concerning my wives, and concerning my sons, an concerning my daughters: I have not kept back from him my silver and my gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  008" id="21  008" >8</span>
 And the elders and all the people said to him, Listen not, and consent not.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  009" id="21  009" >9</span>
 And he said to the messengers of the son of Ader, Say to your master, All things that you have sent to your servant about at first I will do; but this thing I shall not be able to do. And the men departed, and carried back the answer to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  010" id="21  010" >10</span>
 And the son of Ader sent to him, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The LXX. read שועליס for שעליס.  </span>  foxes to all the people, even my infantry.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  011" id="21  011" >11</span>
 And the king of Israel answered and said, Let it be sufficient; let not the humpbacked boast as he that is upright.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  012" id="21  012" >12</span>
 And it came to pass when he returned him this answer, he and all the kings with him were drinking in tents: and he said to his servants,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   build a mound or fortification.  </span>  Form a trench. And they made a trench against the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  013" id="21  013" >13</span>
 And, behold, a prophet came to Achaab king of Israel, and said, Thus says the Lord, Hast you seen this great multitude? behold, I give it this day into your hands; and you shall know that I   am   the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  014" id="21  014" >14</span>
 And Achaab said, Whereby? And he said, Thus says the Lord, by the young men of the heads of the districts. And Achaab said, Who shall  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   engage in the war.  </span>  begin the battle? and he said, You.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  015" id="21  015" >15</span>
 And Achaab  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   reviewed.  </span>  numbered the young men the heads of the districts, and they were two hundred and thirty: and afterwards he numbered the people,   even   every  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   son of strength.  </span>  man fit for war, seven thousand.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  016" id="21  016" >16</span>
 And he went forth at noon, an the son of Ader was drinking   and   getting drunk in Socchoth, he and the kings,   even   thirty and two kings, his allies.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  017" id="21  017" >17</span>
 And the young men the heads of the districts went forth  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   among the first.  </span>  first; and they send and report to the king of Syria, saying, There are men come forth out of Samaria.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  018" id="21  018" >18</span>
 And he said to them, If they come forth peaceably,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   infin. for imper.  </span>  take them alive; and if they come forth to war, take them alive:  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  019" id="21  019" >19</span>
 and let not the young men the heads of the districts go forth of the city. And the force that was behind them  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  020" id="21  020" >20</span>
 struck each one the man next to him; and each one a second time struck the man next to him: and Syria fled, and Israel pursued them; and the son of Ader,   even   the king of Syria, escapes on the horse of a horseman.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  021" id="21  021" >21</span>
 And the king of Israel went forth, and took all the horses and the chariots, and struck   the enemy   with a great slaughter in Syria.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  022" id="21  022" >22</span>
 And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said, Strengthen yourself, and observe, and see what you shall do; for at the return of the year the son of Ader king of Syria comes up against you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  023" id="21  023" >23</span>
 And the servants of the king of Syria, even they said, The God of Israel   is   a God of mountains, and not a God of valleys; therefore has he prevailed against us: but if we should fight against them in the plain, verily we shall prevail against them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  024" id="21  024" >24</span>
 And do you this thing: Send away the kings, each one to his place, and set princes in their stead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  025" id="21  025" >25</span>
 And we will  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   change.  </span>  give you   another   army according to the army that was destroyed, and cavalry according to the cavalry, and chariots according to the chariots, and we will fight against them in the plain, and we shall prevail against them. And he listened to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   his.  </span>  their voice, and did so.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  026" id="21  026" >26</span>
 And it came to pass at the return of the year, that the son of Ader reviewed Syria, and went up to Apheca to war against Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  027" id="21  027" >27</span>
 And the children of Israel were numbered, and came to meet them: and Israel encamped before them as two little flocks of goats, but Syria filled the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  028" id="21  028" >28</span>
 And there came the man of God, and said to the king of Israel, Thus says the Lord, Because Syria has said, The Lord God of Israel   is   a God of the hills, and he   is   not a God of the valleys, therefore will I give this great army into your hand, and you shall know that I   am   the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  029" id="21  029" >29</span>
 And they encamp one over against the other before  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   these.  </span>  them seven days. And it came to pass on the seventh day that the battle drew on, and Israel struck Syria,   even   a hundred thousand footmen in one day.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  030" id="21  030" >30</span>
 And the rest fled to Apheca, into the city; and the wall fell upon twenty-seven thousand men that were left: and the son of Ader fled, and entered into  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the house of the chamber.  </span>  an inner chamber, into a closet.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  031" id="21  031" >31</span>
 And he said to his servants, I know that the kings of Israel are  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   kings of mercy.  </span>  merciful kings: let us now put sackcloth upon our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and let us go forth to the king of Israel, if by any means he will save our souls alive.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  032" id="21  032" >32</span>
 So they girded sackcloth upon their loins, and put ropes upon their heads, and said to the king of Israel, Your servant the son of Ader says, Let our  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   soul.  </span>  souls live, I pray you. And he said, Does he yet live? He is my brother.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  033" id="21  033" >33</span>
 And the men divined, and offered  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   poured libations, but some read ἔσπευσαν, which answers exactly to the   Heb.  </span>  drink-offerings; and they caught the word out of his mouth, and said, Your brother the son of Ader. And he said, Go you° in and fetch him. And the son of Ader went out to him, and they cause him to go up to him  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   upon   or   to.  </span>  into the chariot.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  034" id="21  034" >34</span>
 And he said to him, The cities which my father took from your father I will restore to you; and you shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made streets in Samaria; and I will let you go with a covenant. And he made a covenant with him, and let him go.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  035" id="21  035" >35</span>
 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor by the word of the Lord, Strike me, I pray, And the man would not strike him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  036" id="21  036" >36</span>
 And he said to him, Because you have not listened to the voice of the Lord, therefore, behold, as you depart from me, a lion shall strike you: and he departed from him, and a lion found him, and struck him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  037" id="21  037" >37</span>
 And he finds another man, and says, Strike me, I pray you. And the man struck him, and in striking wounded   him  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  038" id="21  038" >38</span>
 And the prophet went and stood before the king of Israel by the way, and bound his eyes with a bandage.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  039" id="21  039" >39</span>
 And it came to pass as the king passed by, that he cried aloud to the king, and said, Your servant went out to war, and, behold, a man brought   another   man to me, and said to me, Keep his man; and if he should by any means escape, then your  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   soul.  </span>  life shall go for his life, or you shall pay a talent of silver.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  040" id="21  040" >40</span>
 And it came to pass, that your servant looked round this way and that way, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   he was not.  </span>  the man was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, Behold, you have also  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   slain.  </span>  destroyed snares   set   for me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  041" id="21  041" >41</span>
 And he hasted, and took away the bandage from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized him, that he was one of the prophets.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  042" id="21  042" >42</span>
 And he said to him, Thus says the Lord, Because you have suffered to escape out of your hand a man appointed to destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01121  043" id="21  043" >43</span>
 And the king of Israel departed confounded and discouraged, and came to Samaria.

<p><span class="chapter" id="22  001">22  </span> And he rested three years, and there was no war between Syria and Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  002" id="22  002" >2</span>
 And it came to pass in the third year, that Josaphat king of Juda went down to the king of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  003" id="22  003" >3</span>
 And the king of Israel said to his servants, Know you° that Remmath Galaad   is   ours, and we are  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   silent.  </span>  slow to take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  004" id="22  004" >4</span>
 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, Will you go up with us to Remmath Galaad to battle?  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  005" id="22  005" >5</span>
 And Josaphat said, As I   am  , so   are   you also; as my people,   so is   your people; as my horses,   so are   your horses. And Josaphat king of Juda said to the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray you, of the Lord today.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  006" id="22  006" >6</span>
 And the king of Israel gathered all the prophets together, about four hundred men; and the king said to them, Shall I go up to Remmath Galaad to battle, or shall I forbear? and they said, Go up, and the Lord will surely give   it   into the hands of the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  007" id="22  007" >7</span>
 And Josaphat said to the king of Israel, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and we will enquire.  </span>  that we may enquire of the Lord by him?  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  008" id="22  008" >8</span>
 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, There is one man here   for us   to enquire of the Lord  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   by him.  </span>  by; but I hate him, for he does not speak good of me, but only evil; Michaias son of Jemblaa. And Josaphat king of Juda said, Let not the king say so.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  009" id="22  009" >9</span>
 And the king of Israel called a eunuch and said,   Bring hither   quickly Michaias son of Jemblaa.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  010" id="22  010" >10</span>
 And the king of Israel and Josaphat king of Juda  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See   Heb.  </span>  sat, each on his throne, armed in the gates of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  011" id="22  011" >11</span>
 And Sedekias son of Chanaan made for himself iron horns, and said, Thus says the Lord, With these you shall  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   gore.  </span>  push Syria, until it be consumed.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  012" id="22  012" >12</span>
 And all the prophets prophesied in like manner, saying, Go up to Remmath Galaad, and   the thing   shall prosper, and the Lord shall deliver it and the king of Syria into your hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  013" id="22  013" >13</span>
 And the messenger that went to call Michaias spoke to him, saying, Behold now, all the prophets speak with one mouth good concerning the king, let now your words be like the words of one of them, and speak good things.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  014" id="22  014" >14</span>
 And Michaias said,   As   the Lord lives, whatever the Lord shall say to me,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   these things.  </span>  that will I speak.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  015" id="22  015" >15</span>
 And he came to the king: and the king said to him, Michaias, shall I go up to Remmath Galaad to battle, or shall I forbear? and he said, Go up, and the Lord shall  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   prosper the work, etc.  </span>  deliver it into the hand of the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  016" id="22  016" >16</span>
 And the king said to him, How often shall I adjure you, that you speak to me truth in the name of the Lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  017" id="22  017" >17</span>
 And he said, Not so. I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains as a flock  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   which has no shepherd.  </span>  without a shepherd: and the Lord said,   Is   not God lord of these? let each one return to his home in peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  018" id="22  018" >18</span>
 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat king of Juda, Did I not say to you that this man does not prophesy good to me, for   he speaks   nothing but evil?  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  019" id="22  019" >19</span>
 And Michaias said, Not so,   it is   not I: hear the word of the Lord;   it is   not so. I saw the God of Israel sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven stood about him on his right hand and on his left.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  020" id="22  020" >20</span>
 And the Lord said, Who will deceive Achaab king of Israel,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and he shall, etc.  </span>  that he may go up and fall in Remmath Galaad? and one spoke one way, and another another way.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  021" id="22  021" >21</span>
 And there came forth a spirit and stood before the Lord, and said, I will deceive him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  022" id="22  022" >22</span>
 And the Lord said to him, Whereby? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a false spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, You shall deceive him, yes, and shall prevail: go forth, and do so.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  023" id="22  023" >23</span>
 And now, behold, the Lord has put a false spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets, and the Lord has spoken evil against you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  024" id="22  024" >24</span>
 And Sedekias the son of Chanaan came near and struck Michaias on the cheek, and said, What sort of a spirit of the Lord   has   spoken in you?  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  025" id="22  025" >25</span>
 And Michaias said, Behold, you shall see in that day, when you shall go into an innermost chamber to hide yourself there.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  026" id="22  026" >26</span>
 And the king of Israel said, Take Michaias, and convey him away to Semer the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   king.  </span>  keeper of the city;  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  027" id="22  027" >27</span>
 and tell Joas the king's son to put this   fellow   in prison, and to feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction until I return in peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  028" id="22  028" >28</span>
 And Michaias said, If you return at all in peace, the Lord has not spoken by me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  029" id="22  029" >29</span>
 So the king of Israel went up, and Josaphat king of Juda with him to Remmath Galaad.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  030" id="22  030" >30</span>
 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat king of Juda, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle, and do you put on my raiment. So the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  031" id="22  031" >31</span>
 And the king of Syria had charged the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight not   against   small  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and.  </span>  or great, but against the king of Israel only.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  032" id="22  032" >32</span>
 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Josaphat king of Juda, that they said, this seems   to be   the king of Israel. And they compassed him about to fight   against   him; and Josaphat cried out.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  033" id="22  033" >33</span>
 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that this was not the king of Israel, that they returned from him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  034" id="22  034" >34</span>
 And one drew a bow with a good aim, and struck the king of Israel between the lungs and the breast-plate: and he said to his charioteer, Turn your hands, and carry me away out of the battle, for I am wounded.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  035" id="22  035" >35</span>
 And the war was turned in that day, and the king was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   remaining.  </span>  standing on the chariot, against Syria from morning till evening; and he shed the blood out of his wound, into the bottom of the chariot, and died at even, and the blood ran out of the wound into the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   bosom.  </span>  bottom of the chariot.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  036" id="22  036" >36</span>
 And the herald of the army stood at sunset, saying, Let every man go to his own city and his own land,  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  037" id="22  037" >37</span>
 for the king is dead. And they came to Samaria, and buried the king in Samaria.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  038" id="22  038" >38</span>
 And they washed the chariot at the fountain of Samaria; and the swine and the dogs licked up the blood, and the harlots washed themselves in the blood, according to the word of the Lord which he spoke.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  039" id="22  039" >39</span>
 And the rest of the acts of Achaab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities which he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   made.  </span>  built, behold,   are   not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  040" id="22  040" >40</span>
 And Achaab slept with his fathers, and Ochozias his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  041" id="22  041" >41</span>
 And Josaphat the son of Asa reigned over Juda: in the fourth year of Achaab king of Israel  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   reigned.  </span>  began Josaphat to reign.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  042" id="22  042" >42</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a son of thirty and five years in his reigning.  </span>  Thirty and five years old   was he   when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name   was   Azuba daughter of Salai.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  043" id="22  043" >43</span>
 And he walked in all the way of Asa his father: he turned not from it, even from doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  044" id="22  044" >44</span>
 Only he took not away   any   of the high places: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  045" id="22  045" >45</span>
 And Josaphat was at peace with the king of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  46-50" id="22  46-50" >46-50</span>
 And the rest of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   words.  </span>  acts of Josaphat, and his mighty deeds, whatever he did, behold,   are   not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  051" id="22  051" >51</span>
 And Josaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried by his fathers in the city of David his father, and Joram his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  052" id="22  052" >52</span>
 And Ochozias son of Achaab reigned over Israel in Samaria: in the seventeenth year of Josaphat king of Juda, Ochozias son of Achaab reigned over Israel in Samaria two years.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  053" id="22  053" >53</span>
 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of Achaab his father, and in the way of Jezabel his mother, and in the sins of the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who caused Israel to sin.  <span class="verse" rel="v01122  054" id="22  054" >54</span>
 And he served Baalim, and worshipped them, and provoked the Lord God of Israel, according to all that had been done before him.
