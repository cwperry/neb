<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">A</span>nd it came to pass, after Israel was taken captive, and Jerusalem made desolate,   that   Jeremias sat weeping, and lamented   with   this lamentation over Jerusalem, and said, ALEPH. How does the city that was filled with people sit solitary! she is become as a widow: she that was magnified among the nations,   and   princess among the provinces, has become tributary.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 BETH. She weeps sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; and there is none of all her lovers to comfort her: all that were her friends have dealt deceitfully with her, they are become her enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 GIMEL. Judea is gone into captivity by reason of her affliction, and by reason of the abundance of her servitude: she dwells among the nations, she has not found rest: all her pursuers have overtaken her between her oppressors.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 DALETH. The ways of Sion mourn, because there are none that come to the feast: all her gates are ruined: her priests groan, her virgins are led captive, and she is in bitterness in herself.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 HE. Her oppressors are become the head, and her enemies have prospered; for the Lord has afflicted her because of the multitude of her sins: her young children are gone into captivity before the face of the oppressor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 VAU. And all her beauty has been taken away from the daughter of Sion: her princes were as rams finding no pasture, and are gone   away   in weakness before the face of the pursuer.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 ZAIN. Jerusalem remembered the days of her affliction, and her rejection;   she thought on   all her desirable things which were from the days of old, when her people fell into the hands of the oppressor, and there was none to help her: when her enemies saw   it   they laughed at her habitation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 HETH. Jerusalem has sinned a   great   sin; therefore has she come into tribulation, all that used to honor her have afflicted her, for they have seen her shame: yes, she herself groaned, and turned backward.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 TETH. Her uncleanness is before her feet; she remembered not her last end; she has lowered her boasting   tone  , there is none to comfort her. Behold, O Lord, my affliction: for the enemy has magnified himself.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 JOD. The oppressor has stretched out his hand on all her desirable things: for she has seen the Gentiles entering into her sanctuary,   concerning   whom you did command that they should not enter into your congregation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 CHAPH. All her people groan, seeking bread: they have given their desirable things for meat, to restore their soul: behold, Lord, and look; for she is become dishonored.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 LAMED. All youÂ° that pass by the way, turn, and see if there is sorrow like to my sorrow, which has happened   to me  . The Lord who spoke by me has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 MEM. He has sent fire from his lofty habitation, he has brought it into my bones: he has spread a net for my feet, he has turned me back: he has made me desolate   and   mourning all the day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 NUN. He has watched over my sins, they are twined about my hands, they have come up on my neck: my strength has failed; for the Lord has laid pains on my hands, I shall not be able to stand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 SAMECH. The Lord has cut off all my strong men from the midst of me: he has summoned against me a time for crushing my choice men: the Lord has trodden a wine-press for the virgin daughter of Juda: for these things I weep.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 AIN. Mine eye has poured out water, because he that should comfort me, that should restore my soul, has been removed far from me: my sons have been destroyed, because the enemy has prevailed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 PHE. Sion has spread out her hand,   and   there is none to comfort her: the Lord has commanded   concerning   Jacob, his oppressors are round about him: Jerusalem has become among them as a removed woman.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 TSADE. The Lord is righteous; for I have provoked his mouth: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my grief: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 KOPH. I called my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and my elders failed in the city; for they sought meat that they might restore their souls, and found   it   not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 RHECHS. Behold, O Lord; for I am afflicted: my belly is troubled, and my heart is turned within me; for I have been grievously rebellious: abroad the sword has bereaved me, even as death at home.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  021" id="1  021" >21</span>
 CHSEN. Hear, I pray you, for I groan: there is none to comfort me: all my enemies have heard   of   my afflictions, and rejoice because you have done   it  : you have brought on the day, you have called the time: they are become like to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0251  022" id="1  022" >22</span>
 THAU. Let all their wickedness come before your face; and strip them, as they have made a gleaning for all my sins: for my groans are many, and my heart is grieved.  
<!-- 2   022 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> ALEPH. How has the Lord darkened in his wrath the daughter of Sion! he has cast down the glory of Israel from heaven to earth, and has not remembered his footstool.  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 BETH. In the day of his wrath the Lord has overwhelmed   her   as in the sea,   and   not spared: he has brought down in his fury all the beautiful things of Jacob; he has brought down to the ground the strongholds of the daughter of Juda; he has profaned her kings and her princes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 GIMEL. He has broken in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he has turned back his right hand from the face of the enemy, and has kindled a flame in Jacob as a fire, and it has devoured all things round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 DALETH. He has bent his bow as an opposing enemy: he has strengthened his right hand as an adversary, and has destroyed all the desirable things of my eyes in the tabernacle of the daughter of Sion: he has poured forth his anger as fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 HE. The Lord is become as an enemy: he has overwhelmed Israel as in the sea, he has overwhelmed her palaces: he has destroyed her strongholds, and has multiplied the afflicted and humbled ones to the daughter of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 VAU. And he has scattered his tabernacle as a vine, he has marred his feast: the Lord has forgotten the feast and the sabbath which he appointed in Sion, and in the fury of his wrath has vexed the king, and priest, and prince.  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 ZAIN. The Lord has rejected his altar, he has cast off his sanctuary, he has broken by the hand of the enemy the wall of her palaces; they have uttered their voice in the house of the Lord as on a feast day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 HETH. And he has turned to destroy the wall of the daughter of Sion: he has stretched out the measuring line, he has not turned back his hand from afflicting   her  : therefore the bulwark mourned, and the wall was weakened with it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 TETH. Her gates are sunk into the ground: he has destroyed and broken to pieces her bars,   and   her king and her prince among the Gentiles: there is no law, nay, her prophets have seen no vision from the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 JOD. The elders of the daughter of Sion have sat upon the ground, they have kept silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloths: they have brought down to the ground the chief virgins in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 CHAPH. Mine eyes have failed with tears, my heart is troubled, my glory is cast down to the ground, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; while the infant and suckling swoon in the streets of the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 LAMED. They said to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? while they fainted like wounded men in the streets of the city, while their souls were poured out into their mother's bosom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 MEM. What shall I testify to you, or what shall I compare to you, O daughter of Jerusalem? who shall save and comfort you, O virgin daughter of Sion? for the cup of your destruction is enlarged: who shall heal you?  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 NUN. Your prophets have seen for you vanities and folly: and they have not discovered your iniquity, to turn back your captivity; but they have seen for you vain burdens, and worthless visions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 SAMECH. All that go by the way have clapped their hands at you; they have hissed and shaken their head at the daughter of Jerusalem. Is this the city, they say, the crown of joy of all the earth?  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 AIN. All your enemies have opened their mouth against you: they have hissed and gnashed their teeth, and said, We have swallowed her up: moreover this is the day which we looked for; we have found it, we have seen it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 PHE. The Lord has done that which he purposed; he has accomplished his word,   even   the things which he commanded from the ancient days: he has thrown down, and has not spared: and he has caused the enemy to rejoice over you, he has exalted the horn of him that afflicted you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 TSADE. Their heart cried to the Lord, YouÂ° walls of Sion, pour down tears like torrents day and night: give yourself no rest; let not the apple of your eyes cease.  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 KOPH. Arise, rejoice in the night at the beginning of your watch: pour out your heart as water before the face of the Lord; lift up your hands to him for the life of your infants, who faint for hunger at the top of all the streets.  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 RHECHS. Behold, O Lord, and see for whom you have gathered thus. Shall the women eat the fruit of their womb? the cook has made a gathering: shall the infants sucking at the breasts be slain? will you kill the priest and prophet in the sanctuary of the Lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 CHSEN. The child and old man have lain down in the street: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity: you have slain   them   with the sword and with famine; in the day of your wrath you have mangled   them  , you have not spared.  <span class="verse" rel="v0252  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 THAU. He has called my sojourners round about to a solemn day, and there was not in the day of the wrath of the Lord any one that escaped or was left; whereas I have strengthened and multiplied all my enemies.

<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> ALEPH. I am the man that sees poverty, through the rod of his wrath upon me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 He has taken me, and led me away into darkness, and not   into   light.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 Nay, against me has he turned his hand all the day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 He has made old my flesh and my skin; he has broken my bones.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 BETH. He has built against me, and compassed my head, and brought travail   upon me  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 He has set me in dark places, as them that have long been dead.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 He has builded against me, and I canât come forth: he has made my brazen   chain   heavy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 GIMEL. Yes,   though   I cry and shout, he shuts out my prayer.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 DALETH. He has built up my ways, he has hedged my paths;  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 he has troubled me,   as   a she-bear lying in wait: he is to me   as   a lion in secret places.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 He pursued   me   after I departed, and brought me to a stand: he has utterly ruined me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 HE. He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 He has caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 I became a laughing stock to all my people; and their song all the day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 VAU. He has filled me with bitterness, he has drenched me with gall.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 And he has dashed out my teeth with gravel, he has fed me with ashes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 He has also removed my soul from peace: I forgot prosperity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 Therefore my success has perished, and my hope from the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  019" id="3  019" >19</span>
 ZAIN. I remembered by reason of my poverty, and because of persecution my bitterness and gall shall be remembered;  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  020" id="3  020" >20</span>
 and my soul shall meditate with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  021" id="3  021" >21</span>
 This will I lay up in my heart, therefore I will endure.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  022" id="3  022" >22</span>
 HETH.   It is   the mercies of the Lord, that he has not failed me, because his compassions are not exhausted. Pity   us  , O Lord, early   every   month: for we are not brought to an end, because his compassions are not exhausted.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  023" id="3  023" >23</span>
    They are   new every morning: great is your faithfulness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  024" id="3  024" >24</span>
 The Lord is my portion, says my soul; therefore will I wait for him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  025" id="3  025" >25</span>

 the lips of them that rose up against me, and their plots against me all the day;  <span class="verse" rel="v0253  063" id="3  063" >63</span>
