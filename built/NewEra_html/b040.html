<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">T</span>he book of the words of Tobit, son of Tobiel, the son of Ananiel, the son of Aduel, the son of Gabael, of the seed of Asael, of the tribe of Nephthali;  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 Who in the time of Enemessar king of the Assyrians was led captive out of Thisbe, which is at the right hand of that city, which is called properly Nephthali in Galilee above Aser.  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 I Tobit have walked all the days of my life in the ways of truth and justice, and I did many alms deeds to my brethren, and my nation, who came with me to Nineve, into the land of the Assyrians.  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And when I was in my own country, in the land of Israel being but young, all the tribe of Nephthali my father fell from the house of Jerusalem, which was chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, that all the tribes should sacrifice there, where the temple of the habitation of the most High was consecrated and built for all ages.  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 Now all the tribes which together revolted, and the house of my father Nephthali, sacrificed to the heifer Baal.  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 But I alone went often to Jerusalem at the feasts, as it was ordained to all the people of Israel by an everlasting decree, having the first fruits and tenths of increase, with that which was first shorn; and them gave I at the altar to the priests the children of Aaron.  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 The first tenth part of all increase I gave to the sons of Aaron, who ministered at Jerusalem: another tenth part I sold away, and went, and spent it every year at Jerusalem:  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 And the third I gave to them to whom it was meet, as Debora my father's mother had commanded me, because I was left an orphan by my father.  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 Furthermore, when I was come to the age of a man, I married Anna of my own kindred, and of her I became the father of Tobias.  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 And when we were carried away captives to Nineve, all my brethren and those that were of my kindred did eat of the bread of the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 But I kept myself from eating;  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 Because I remembered God with all my heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 And the most High gave me grace and favor before Enemessar, so that I was his purveyor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 And I went into Media, and left in trust with Gabael, the brother of Gabrias, at Rages a city of Media ten talents of silver.  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 Now when Enemessar was dead, Sennacherib his son reigned in his stead; whose estate was troubled, that I could not go into Media.  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 And in the time of Enemessar I gave many alms to my brethren, and gave my bread to the hungry,  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 And my clothes to the naked: and if I saw any of my nation dead, or cast about the walls of Nineve, I buried him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 And if the king Sennacherib had slain any, when he was come, and fled from Judea, I buried them privily; for in his wrath he killed many; but the bodies were not found, when they were sought for of the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 And when one of the Ninevites went and complained of me to the king, that I buried them, and hid myself; understanding that I was sought for to be put to death, I withdrew myself for fear.  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 Then all my goods were forcibly taken away, neither was there any thing left me, beside my wife Anna and my son Tobias.  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  021" id="1  021" >21</span>
 And there passed not five and fifty days, before two of his sons killed him, and they fled into the mountains of Ararath; and Sarchedonus his son reigned in his stead; who appointed over his father's accounts, and over all his affairs, Achiacharus my brother Anael's son.  <span class="verse" rel="v0401  022" id="1  022" >22</span>
 And Achiacharus intreating for me, I returned to Nineve. Now Achiacharus was cupbearer, and keeper of the signet, and steward, and overseer of the accounts: and Sarchedonus appointed him next to him: and he was my brother's son.  
<!-- 2   022 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> Now when I was come home again, and my wife Anna was restored to me, with my son Tobias, in the feast of Pentecost, which is the holy feast of the seven weeks, there was a good dinner prepared me, in the which I sat down to eat.  <span class="verse" rel="v0402  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 And when I saw abundance of meat, I said to my son, Go and bring what poor man soever you shall find out of our brethren, who is mindful of the Lord; and, behold, I wait for you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0402  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 But he came again, and said, Father, one of our nation is strangled, and is cast out in the marketplace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0402  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 Then before I had tasted of any meat, I started up, and took him up into a room until the going down of the sun.  <span class="verse" rel="v0402  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 Then I returned, and washed myself, and ate my meat in heaviness,  <span class="verse" rel="v0402  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 Remembering that prophecy of Amos, as he said, Your feasts shall be turned into mourning, and all your mirth into lamentation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0402  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 Therefore I wept: and after the going down of the sun I went and made a grave, and buried him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0402  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 But my neighbors mocked me, and said, This man is not yet afraid to be put to death for this matter: who fled away; and yet, behold, he buries the dead again.  <span class="verse" rel="v0402  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 The same night also I returned from the burial, and slept by the wall of my courtyard, being polluted and my face was uncovered:  <span class="verse" rel="v0402  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 And I knew not that there were sparrows in the wall, and my eyes being open, the sparrows muted warm dung into my eyes, and a whiteness came in my eyes: and I went to the physicians, but they helped me not: moreover Achiacharus did nourish me, until I went into Elymais.  <span class="verse" rel="v0402  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 And my wife Anna did take women's works to do.  <span class="verse" rel="v0402  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 And when she had sent them home to the owners, they paid her wages, and gave her also besides a kid.  <span class="verse" rel="v0402  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 And when it was in my house, and began to cry, I said to her, From whence is this kid? is it not stolen? render it to the owners; for it is not lawful to eat any thing that is stolen.  <span class="verse" rel="v0402  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 But she replied upon me, It was given for a gift more than the wages. Howbeit I did not believe her, but bade her render it to the owners: and I was abashed at her. But she replied upon me, Where are your alms and your righteous deeds? behold, you and all your works are known.  
<!-- 3   014 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> Then I being grieved did weep, and in my sorrow prayed, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0403  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 O Lord, you are just, and all your works and all your ways are mercy and truth, and you judge truly and justly for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0403  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 Remember me, and look on me, punish me not for my sins and ignorances, and the sins of my fathers, who have sinned before you:  <span class="verse" rel="v0403  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 For they obeyed not your commandments: therefore you have delivered us for a spoil, and to captivity, and to death, and for a proverb of reproach to all the nations among whom we are dispersed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0403  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 And now your judgments are many and true: deal with me according to my sins and my fathers': because we have not kept your commandments, neither have walked in truth before you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0403  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 Now therefore deal with me as seems best to you, and command my spirit to be taken from me, that I may be dissolved, and become earth: for it is profitable for me to die rather than to live, because I have heard false reproaches, and have much sorrow: command therefore that I may now be delivered out of this distress, and go into the everlasting place: turn not your face away from me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0403  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 It came to pass the same day, that in Ecbatane a city of Media Sara the daughter of Raguel was also reproached by her father's maids;  <span class="verse" rel="v0403  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 Because that she had been married to seven husbands, whom Asmodeus the evil spirit had killed, before they had lain with her. Do you not know, said they, that you have strangled your husbands? you have had already seven husbands, neither was you named after any of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0403  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 Therefore do you beat us for them? if they be dead, go your ways after them, let us never see of you either son or daughter.  <span class="verse" rel="v0403  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 When she heard these things, she was very sorrowful, so that she thought to have strangled herself; and she said, I am the only daughter of my father, and if I do this, it shall be a reproach to him, and I shall bring his old age with sorrow to the grave.  <span class="verse" rel="v0403  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 Then she prayed toward the window, and said, Blessed are you, O Lord my God, and your holy and glorious name is blessed and honorable for ever: let all your works praise you for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0403  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 And now, O Lord, I set I my eyes and my face toward you,  <span class="verse" rel="v0403  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 And say, Take me out of the earth, that I may hear no more the reproach.  <span class="verse" rel="v0403  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 You know, Lord, that I am pure from all sin with man,  <span class="verse" rel="v0403  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 And that I never polluted my name, nor the name of my father, in the land of my captivity: I am the only daughter of my father, neither has he any child to be his heir, neither any near kinsman, nor any son of his alive, to whom I may keep myself for a wife: my seven husbands are already dead; and why should I live? but if it please not you that I should die, command some regard to be had of me, and pity taken of me, that I hear no more reproach.  <span class="verse" rel="v0403  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 So the prayers of them both were heard before the majesty of the great God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0403  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 And Raphael was sent to heal them both, that is, to scale away the whiteness of Tobit's eyes, and to give Sara the daughter of Raguel for a wife to Tobias the son of Tobit; and to bind Asmodeus the evil spirit; because she belonged to Tobias by right of inheritance. The selfsame time came Tobit home, and entered into his house, and Sara the daughter of Raguel came down from her upper chamber.  
<!-- 4   017 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> In that day Tobit remembered the money which he had committed to Gabael in Rages of Media,  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 And said with himself, I have wished for death; therefore do I not call for my son Tobias that I may signify to him of the money before I die?  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 And when he had called him, he said, My son, when I am dead, bury me; and despise not your mother, but honor her all the days of your life, and do that which shall please her, and grieve her not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 Remember, my son, that she saw many dangers for you, when you were in her womb: and when she is dead, bury her by me in one grave.  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  005" id="4  005" >5</span>
 My son, be mindful of the Lord our God all your days, and let not your will be set to sin, or to transgress his commandments: do uprightly all your life long, and follow not the ways of unrighteousness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 For if you deal truly, your doings shall prosperously succeed to you, and to all them that live justly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 Give alms of your substance; and when you give alms, let not your eye be envious, neither turn your face from any poor, and the face of God shall not be turned away from you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 If you have abundance give alms accordingly: if you have but a little, be not afraid to give according to that little:  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 For you lay up a good treasure for yourself against the day of necessity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 Because that alms do deliver from death, and suffers not to come into darkness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 For alms is a good gift to all that give it in the sight of the most High.  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 Beware of all whoredom, my son, and chiefly take a wife of the seed of your fathers, and take not a strange woman to wife, which is not of your father's tribe: for we are the children of the prophets, Noe, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: remember, my son, that our fathers from the beginning, even that they all married wives of their own kindred, and were blessed in their children, and their seed shall inherit the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 Now therefore, my son, love your brethren, and despise not in your heart your brethren, the sons and daughters of your people, in not taking a wife of them: for in pride is destruction and much trouble, and in lewdness is decay and great lack: for lewdness is the mother of famine.  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  014" id="4  014" >14</span>
 Let not the wages of any man, which has wrought for you, wait with you, but give him it out of hand: for if you serve God, he will also repay you: be circumspect my son, in all things you do, and be wise in all your conversation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  015" id="4  015" >15</span>
 Do that to no man which you hate: drink not wine to make you drunken: neither let drunkenness go with you in your journey.  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  016" id="4  016" >16</span>
 Give of your bread to the hungry, and of your garments to them that are naked; and according to your abundance give alms: and let not your eye be envious, when you give alms.  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  017" id="4  017" >17</span>
 Pour out your bread on the burial of the just, but give nothing to the wicked.  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  018" id="4  018" >18</span>
 Ask counsel of all that are wise, and despise not any counsel that is profitable.  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  019" id="4  019" >19</span>
 Bless the Lord your God always, and desire of him that your ways may be directed, and that all your paths and counsels may prosper: for every nation has not counsel; but the Lord himself gives all good things, and he humbles whom he will, as he will; now therefore, my son, remember my commandments, neither let them be put out of your mind.  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  020" id="4  020" >20</span>
 And now I signify this to they that I committed ten talents to Gabael the son of Gabrias at Rages in Media.  <span class="verse" rel="v0404  021" id="4  021" >21</span>
 And fear not, my son, that we are made poor: for you have much wealth, if you fear God, and depart from all sin, and do that which is pleasing in his sight.

<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> Tobias then answered and said, Father, I will do all things which you have commanded me:  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 But how can I receive the money, seeing I know him not?  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 Then he gave him the handwriting, and said to him, Seek you a man which may go with you, while I yet live, and I will give him wages: and go and receive the money.  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 Therefore when he went to seek a man, he found Raphael that was an angel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 But he knew not; and he said to him, Canst you go with me to Rages? and know you those places well?  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 To whom the angel said, I will go with you, and I know the way well: for I have lodged with our brother Gabael.  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 Then Tobias said to him, Tarry for me, till I tell my father.  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 Then he said to him, Go and wait not. So he went in and said to his father, Behold, I have found one which will go with me. Then he said, Call him to me, that I may know of what tribe he is, and whether he be a trusty man to go with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 So he called him, and he came in, and they saluted one another.  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 Then Tobit said to him, Brother, show me of what tribe and family you are.  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  011" id="5  011" >11</span>
 To whom he said, Do you seek for a tribe or family, or an hired man to go with your son? Then Tobit said to him, I would know, brother, your kindred and name.  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  012" id="5  012" >12</span>
 Then he said, I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the great, and of your brethren.  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  013" id="5  013" >13</span>
 Then Tobit said, You are welcome, brother; be not now angry with me, because I have enquired to know your tribe and your family; for you are my brother, of an honest and good stock: for I know Ananias and Jonathas, sons of that great Samaias, as we went together to Jerusalem to worship, and offered the firstborn, and the tenths of the fruits; and they were not seduced with the error of our brethren: my brother, you are of a good stock.  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 But tell me, what wages shall I give you? will you a drachm a day, and things necessary, as to my own son?  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  015" id="5  015" >15</span>
 Yes, moreover, if you° return safe, I will add something to your wages.  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  016" id="5  016" >16</span>
 So they were well pleased. Then said he to Tobias, Prepare yourself for the journey, and God send you a good journey. And when his son had prepared all things far the journey, his father said, Go you with this man, and God, which dwells in heaven, prosper your journey, and the angel of God keep you company. So they went forth both, and the young man's dog with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  017" id="5  017" >17</span>
 But Anna his mother wept, and said to Tobit, Why have you sent away our son? is he not the staff of our hand, in going in and out before us?  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  018" id="5  018" >18</span>
 Be not greedy to add money to money: but let it be as refuse in respect of our child.  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  019" id="5  019" >19</span>
 For that which the Lord has given us to live with does suffice us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  020" id="5  020" >20</span>
 Then said Tobit to her, Take no care, my sister; he shall return in safety, and your eyes shall see him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  021" id="5  021" >21</span>
 For the good angel will keep him company, and his journey shall be prosperous, and he shall return safe.  <span class="verse" rel="v0405  022" id="5  022" >22</span>
 Then she made an end of weeping.  
<!-- 6   022 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="6  001">6  </span> And as they went on their journey, they came in the evening to the river Tigris, and they lodged there.  <span class="verse" rel="v0406  002" id="6  002" >2</span>
 And when the young man went down to wash himself, a fish leaped out of the river, and would have devoured him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0406  003" id="6  003" >3</span>
 Then the angel said to him, Take the fish. And the young man laid hold of the fish, and drew it to land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0406  004" id="6  004" >4</span>
 To whom the angel said, Open the fish, and take the heart and the liver and the gall, and put them up safely.  <span class="verse" rel="v0406  005" id="6  005" >5</span>
 So the young man did as the angel commanded him; and when they had roasted the fish, they did eat it: then they both went on their way, till they drew near to Ecbatane.  <span class="verse" rel="v0406  006" id="6  006" >6</span>
 Then the young man said to the angel, Brother Azarias, to what use is the heart and the liver and the gal of the fish?  <span class="verse" rel="v0406  007" id="6  007" >7</span>
 And he said to him, Touching the heart and the liver, if a devil or an evil spirit trouble any, we must make a smoke thereof before the man or the woman, and the party shall be no more vexed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0406  008" id="6  008" >8</span>
 As for the gall, it is good to anoint a man that has whiteness in his eyes, and he shall be healed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0406  009" id="6  009" >9</span>
 And when they were come near to Rages,  <span class="verse" rel="v0406  010" id="6  010" >10</span>
 The angel said to the young man, Brother, to day we shall lodge with Raguel, who is your cousin; he also has one only daughter, named Sara; I will speak for her, that she may be given you for a wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v0406  011" id="6  011" >11</span>
 For to you does the right of her appertain, seeing you only are of her kindred.  <span class="verse" rel="v0406  012" id="6  012" >12</span>
 And the maid is fair and wise: now therefore hear me, and I will speak to her father; and when we return from Rages we will celebrate the marriage: for I know that Raguel can’t marry her to another according to the law of Moses, but he shall be guilty of death, because the right of inheritance does rather appertain to you than to any other.  <span class="verse" rel="v0406  013" id="6  013" >13</span>
 Then the young man answered the angel, I have heard, brother Azarias that this maid has been given to seven men, who all died in the marriage chamber.  <span class="verse" rel="v0406  014" id="6  014" >14</span>
 And now I am the only son of my father, and I am afraid, lest if I go in to her, I die, as the other before: for a wicked spirit loves her, which hurts no body, but those which come to her; therefore I also fear lest I die, and bring my father's and my mother's life because of me to the grave with sorrow: for they have no other son to bury them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0406  015" id="6  015" >15</span>
 Then the angel said to him, Do you not remember the precepts which your father gave you, that you should marry a wife of your own kindred? therefore hear me, O my brother; for she shall be given you to wife; and make you no reckoning of the evil spirit; for this same night shall she be given you in marriage.  <span class="verse" rel="v0406  016" id="6  016" >16</span>
 And when you shall come into the marriage chamber, you shall take the ashes of perfume, and shall lay upon them some of the heart and liver of the fish, and shall make a smoke with it:  <span class="verse" rel="v0406  017" id="6  017" >17</span>
 And the devil shall smell it, and flee away, and never come again any more: but when you shall come to her, rise up both of you, and pray to God which is merciful, who will have pity on you, and save you: fear not, for she is appointed to you from the beginning; and you shall preserve her, and she shall go with you. Moreover I suppose that she shall bear you children. Now when Tobias had heard these things, he loved her, and his heart was effectually joined to her.  
<!-- 7   017 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="7  001">7  </span> And when they were come to Ecbatane, they came to the house of Raguel, and Sara met them: and after they had saluted one another, she brought them into the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0407  002" id="7  002" >2</span>
 Then said Raguel to Edna his wife, How like is this young man to Tobit my cousin!  <span class="verse" rel="v0407  003" id="7  003" >3</span>
 And Raguel asked them, From whence are you°, brethren? To whom they said, We are of the sons of Nephthalim, which are captives in Nineve.  <span class="verse" rel="v0407  004" id="7  004" >4</span>
 Then he said to them, Do you° know Tobit our kinsman? And they said, We know him. Then said he, Is he in good health?  <span class="verse" rel="v0407  005" id="7  005" >5</span>
 And they said, He is both alive, and in good health: and Tobias said, He is my father.  <span class="verse" rel="v0407  006" id="7  006" >6</span>
 Then Raguel leaped up, and kissed him, and wept,  <span class="verse" rel="v0407  007" id="7  007" >7</span>
 And blessed him, and said to him, You are the son of an honest and good man. But when he had heard that Tobit was blind, he was sorrowful, and wept.  <span class="verse" rel="v0407  008" id="7  008" >8</span>
 And likewise Edna his wife and Sara his daughter wept. Moreover they entertained them cheerfully; and after that they had killed a ram of the flock, they set store of meat on the table. Then said Tobias to Raphael, Brother Azarias, speak of those things of which you did talk in the way, and let this business be dispatched.  <span class="verse" rel="v0407  009" id="7  009" >9</span>
 So he communicated the matter with Raguel: and Raguel said to Tobias, Eat and drink, and make merry:  <span class="verse" rel="v0407  010" id="7  010" >10</span>
 For it is meet that you should marry my daughter: nevertheless I will declare to you the truth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0407  011" id="7  011" >11</span>
 I have given my daughter in marriage to seven men, who died that night they came in to her: nevertheless for the present be merry. But Tobias said, I will eat nothing here, till we agree and swear one to another.  <span class="verse" rel="v0407  012" id="7  012" >12</span>
 Raguel said, Then take her from henceforth according to the manner, for you are her cousin, and she is your, and the merciful God give you good success in all things.  <span class="verse" rel="v0407  013" id="7  013" >13</span>
 Then he called his daughter Sara, and she came to her father, and he took her by the hand, and gave her to be wife to Tobias, saying, Behold, take her after the law of Moses, and lead her away to your father. And he blessed them;  <span class="verse" rel="v0407  014" id="7  014" >14</span>
 And called Edna his wife, and took paper, and did write an instrument of covenants, and sealed it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0407  015" id="7  015" >15</span>
 Then they began to eat.  <span class="verse" rel="v0407  016" id="7  016" >16</span>
 After Raguel called his wife Edna, and said to her, Sister, prepare another chamber, and bring her in there.  <span class="verse" rel="v0407  017" id="7  017" >17</span>
 Which when she had done as he had bidden her, she brought her there: and she wept, and she received the tears of her daughter, and said to her,  <span class="verse" rel="v0407  018" id="7  018" >18</span>
 Be of good comfort, my daughter; the Lord of heaven and earth give you joy for this your sorrow: be of good comfort, my daughter.  
<!-- 8   018 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> And when they had supped, they brought Tobias in to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 And as he went, he remembered the words of Raphael, and took the ashes of the perfumes, and put the heart and the liver of the fish thereupon, and made a smoke therewith.  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 The which smell when the evil spirit had smelled, he fled into the utmost parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  004" id="8  004" >4</span>
 And after that they were both shut in together, Tobias rose out of the bed, and said, Sister, arise, and let us pray that God would have pity on us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 Then began Tobias to say, Blessed are you, O God of our fathers, and blessed is your holy and glorious name for ever; let the heavens bless you, and all your creatures.  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 You made Adam, and gave him Eve his wife for an helper and stay: of them came mankind: you have said, It is not good that man should be alone; let us make to him an aid like to himself.  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  007" id="8  007" >7</span>
 And now, O Lord, I take not this my sister for lush but uprightly: therefore mercifully ordain that we may become aged together.  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  008" id="8  008" >8</span>
 And she said with him, Amen.  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 So they slept both that night. And Raguel arose, and went and made a grave,  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 Saying, I fear lest he also be dead.  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  011" id="8  011" >11</span>
 But when Raguel was come into his house,  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  012" id="8  012" >12</span>
 He said to his wife Edna. Send one of the maids, and let her see whether he be alive: if he be not, that we may bury him, and no man know it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 So the maid opened the door, and went in, and found them both asleep,  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 And came forth, and told them that he was alive.  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  015" id="8  015" >15</span>
 Then Raguel praised God, and said, O God, you are worthy to be praised with all pure and holy praise; therefore let your saints praise you with all your creatures; and let all your angels and your elect praise you for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  016" id="8  016" >16</span>
 You are to be praised, for you have made me joyful; and that is not come to me which I suspected; but you have dealt with us according to your great mercy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  017" id="8  017" >17</span>
 You are to be praised because you have had mercy of two that were the only begotten children of their fathers: grant them mercy, O Lord, and finish their life in health with joy and mercy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  018" id="8  018" >18</span>
 Then Raguel bade his servants to fill the grave.  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  019" id="8  019" >19</span>
 And he kept the wedding feast fourteen days.  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  020" id="8  020" >20</span>
 For before the days of the marriage were finished, Raguel had said to him by an oath, that he should not depart till the fourteen days of the marriage were expired;  <span class="verse" rel="v0408  021" id="8  021" >21</span>
 And then he should take the half of his goods, and go in safety to his father; and should have the rest when I and my wife be dead.  
<!-- 9   021 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="9  001">9  </span> Then Tobias called Raphael, and said to him,  <span class="verse" rel="v0409  002" id="9  002" >2</span>
 Brother Azarias, take with you a servant, and two camels, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and bring me the money, and bring him to the wedding.  <span class="verse" rel="v0409  003" id="9  003" >3</span>
 For Raguel has sworn that I shall not depart.  <span class="verse" rel="v0409  004" id="9  004" >4</span>
 But my father counts the days; and if I wait long, he will be very sorry.  <span class="verse" rel="v0409  005" id="9  005" >5</span>
 So Raphael went out, and lodged with Gabael, and gave him the handwriting: who brought forth bags which were sealed up, and gave them to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0409  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
 And early in the morning they went forth both together, and came to the wedding: and Tobias blessed his wife.  
<!-- 10   006 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="10  001">10  </span> Now Tobit his father counted every day: and when the days of the journey were expired, and they came not,  <span class="verse" rel="v04010  002" id="10  002" >2</span>
 Then Tobit said, Are they detained? or is Gabael dead, and there is no man to give him the money?  <span class="verse" rel="v04010  003" id="10  003" >3</span>
 Therefore he was very sorry.  <span class="verse" rel="v04010  004" id="10  004" >4</span>
 Then his wife said to him, My son is dead, seeing he stays long; and she began to wail him, and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v04010  005" id="10  005" >5</span>
 Now I care for nothing, my son, since I have let you go, the light of my eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v04010  006" id="10  006" >6</span>
 To whom Tobit said, Hold your peace, take no care, for he is safe.  <span class="verse" rel="v04010  007" id="10  007" >7</span>
 But she said, Hold your peace, and deceive me not; my son is dead. And she went out every day into the way which they went, and did eat no meat on the daytime, and ceased not whole nights to bewail her son Tobias, until the fourteen days of the wedding were expired, which Raguel had sworn that he should spend there. Then Tobias said to Raguel,  <span class="verse" rel="v04010  008" id="10  008" >8</span>
 Let me go, for my father and my mother look no more to see me.  <span class="verse" rel="v04010  009" id="10  009" >9</span>
 But his father in law said to him, Tarry with me, and I will send to your father, and they shall declare to him how things go with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v04010  010" id="10  010" >10</span>
 But Tobias said, No; but let me go to my father.  <span class="verse" rel="v04010  011" id="10  011" >11</span>
 Then Raguel arose, and gave him Sara his wife, and half his goods, servants, and cattle, and money:  <span class="verse" rel="v04010  012" id="10  012" >12</span>
 And he blessed them, and sent them away, saying, The God of heaven give you a prosperous journey, my children.  <span class="verse" rel="v04010  013" id="10  013" >13</span>
 And he said to his daughter, Honor your father and your mother in law, which are now your parents, that I may hear good report of you. And he kissed her. Edna also said to Tobias, The Lord of heaven restore you, my dear brother, and grant that I may see your children of my daughter Sara before I die, that I may rejoice before the Lord: behold, I commit my daughter to you of special trust; where are do not entreat her evil.  
<!-- 11   013 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="11  001">11  </span> After these things Tobias went his way, praising God that he had given him a prosperous journey, and blessed Raguel and Edna his wife, and went on his way till they drew near to Nineve.  <span class="verse" rel="v04011  002" id="11  002" >2</span>
 Then Raphael said to Tobias, You know, brother, how you did leave your father:  <span class="verse" rel="v04011  003" id="11  003" >3</span>
 Let us haste before your wife, and prepare the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v04011  004" id="11  004" >4</span>
 And take in your hand the gall of the fish. So they went their way, and the dog went after them.  <span class="verse" rel="v04011  005" id="11  005" >5</span>
 Now Anna sat looking about toward the way for her son.  <span class="verse" rel="v04011  006" id="11  006" >6</span>
 And when she espied him coming, she said to his father, Behold, your son comes, and the man that went with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04011  007" id="11  007" >7</span>
 Then said Raphael, I know, Tobias, that your father will open his eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v04011  008" id="11  008" >8</span>
 Therefore anoint you his eyes with the gall, and being pricked therewith, he shall rub, and the whiteness shall fall away, and he shall see you.  <span class="verse" rel="v04011  009" id="11  009" >9</span>
 Then Anna ran forth, and fell upon the neck of her son, and said to him, Seeing I have seen you, my son, from henceforth I am content to die. And they wept both.  <span class="verse" rel="v04011  010" id="11  010" >10</span>
 Tobit also went forth toward the door, and stumbled: but his son ran to him,  <span class="verse" rel="v04011  011" id="11  011" >11</span>
 And took hold of his father: and he struck of the gall on his fathers' eyes, saying, Be of good hope, my father.  <span class="verse" rel="v04011  012" id="11  012" >12</span>
 And when his eyes began to hurt, he rubbed them;  <span class="verse" rel="v04011  013" id="11  013" >13</span>
 And the whiteness pilled away from the corners of his eyes: and when he saw his son, he fell upon his neck.  <span class="verse" rel="v04011  014" id="11  014" >14</span>
 And he wept, and said, Blessed are you, O God, and blessed is your name for ever; and blessed are all your holy angels:  <span class="verse" rel="v04011  015" id="11  015" >15</span>
 For you have scourged, and have taken pity on me: for, behold, I see my son Tobias. And his son went in rejoicing, and told his father the great things that had happened to him in Media.  <span class="verse" rel="v04011  016" id="11  016" >16</span>
 Then Tobit went out to meet his daughter in law at the gate of Nineve, rejoicing and praising God: and they which saw him go marveled, because he had received his sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v04011  017" id="11  017" >17</span>
 But Tobias gave thanks before them, because God had mercy on him. And when he came near to Sara his daughter in law, he blessed her, saying, You are welcome, daughter: God be blessed, which has brought you to us, and blessed be your father and your mother. And there was joy among all his brethren which were at Nineve.  <span class="verse" rel="v04011  018" id="11  018" >18</span>
 And Achiacharus, and Nasbas his brother's son, came:  <span class="verse" rel="v04011  019" id="11  019" >19</span>
 And Tobias' wedding was kept seven days with great joy.

<p><span class="chapter" id="12  001">12  </span> Then Tobit called his son Tobias, and said to him, My son, see that the man have his wages, which went with you, and you must give him more.  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  002" id="12  002" >2</span>
 And Tobias said to him, O father, it is no harm to me to give him half of those things which I have brought:  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  003" id="12  003" >3</span>
 For he has brought me again to you in safety, and made whole my wife, and brought me the money, and likewise healed you.  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  004" id="12  004" >4</span>
 Then the old man said, It is due to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  005" id="12  005" >5</span>
 So he called the angel, and he said to him, Take half of all that you° have brought and go away in safety.  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  006" id="12  006" >6</span>
 Then he took them both apart, and said to them, Bless God, praise him, and magnify him, and praise him for the things which he has done to you in the sight of all that live. It is good to praise God, and exalt his name, and honorably to show forth the works of God; therefore be not slack to praise him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  007" id="12  007" >7</span>
 It is good to keep close the secret of a king, but it is honorable to reveal the works of God. Do that which is good, and no evil shall touch you.  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  008" id="12  008" >8</span>
 Prayer is good with fasting and alms and righteousness. A little with righteousness is better than much with unrighteousness. It is better to give alms than to lay up gold:  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  009" id="12  009" >9</span>
 For alms does deliver from death, and shall purge away all sin. Those that exercise alms and righteousness shall be filled with life:  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  010" id="12  010" >10</span>
 But they that sin are enemies to their own life.  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  011" id="12  011" >11</span>
 Surely I will keep close nothing from you. For I said, It was good to keep close the secret of a king, but that it was honorable to reveal the works of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  012" id="12  012" >12</span>
 Now therefore, when you did pray, and Sara your daughter in law, I did bring the remembrance of your prayers before the Holy One: and when you did bury the dead, I was with you likewise.  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  013" id="12  013" >13</span>
 And when you did not delay to rise up, and leave your dinner, to go and cover the dead, your good deed was not hid from me: but I was with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  014" id="12  014" >14</span>
 And now God has sent me to heal you and Sara your daughter in law.  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  015" id="12  015" >15</span>
 I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and which go in and out before the glory of the Holy One.  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  016" id="12  016" >16</span>
 Then they were both troubled, and fell upon their faces: for they feared.  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  017" id="12  017" >17</span>
 But he said to them, Fear not, for it shall go well with you; praise God therefore.  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  018" id="12  018" >18</span>
 For not of any favor of mine, but by the will of our God I came; therefore praise him for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  019" id="12  019" >19</span>
 All these days I did appear to you; but I did neither eat nor drink, but you° did see a vision.  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  020" id="12  020" >20</span>
 Now therefore give God thanks: for I go up to him that sent me; but write all things which are done in a book.  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  021" id="12  021" >21</span>
 And when they arose, they saw him no more.  <span class="verse" rel="v04012  022" id="12  022" >22</span>
 Then they confessed the great and wonderful works of God, and how the angel of the Lord had appeared to them.  
<!-- 13   022 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="13  001">13  </span> Then Tobit wrote a prayer of rejoicing, and said, Blessed be God that lives for ever, and blessed be his kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v04013  002" id="13  002" >2</span>
 For he does scourge, and has mercy: he leads down to hell, and brings up again: neither is there any that can avoid his hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v04013  003" id="13  003" >3</span>
 Confess him before the Gentiles, you° children of Israel: for he has scattered us among them.  <span class="verse" rel="v04013  004" id="13  004" >4</span>
 There declare his greatness, and extol him before all the living: for he is our Lord, and he is the God our Father for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v04013  005" id="13  005" >5</span>
 And he will scourge us for our iniquities, and will have mercy again, and will gather us out of all nations, among whom he has scattered us.  <span class="verse" rel="v04013  006" id="13  006" >6</span>
 If you° turn to him with your whole heart, and with your whole mind, and deal uprightly before him, then will he turn to you, and will not hide his face from you. Therefore see what he will do with you, and confess him with your whole mouth, and praise the Lord of might, and extol the everlasting King. In the land of my captivity do I praise him, and declare his might and majesty to a sinful nation. O you° sinners, turn and do justice before him: who can tell if he will accept you, and have mercy on you?  <span class="verse" rel="v04013  007" id="13  007" >7</span>
 I will extol my God, and my soul shall praise the King of heaven, and shall rejoice in his greatness.  <span class="verse" rel="v04013  008" id="13  008" >8</span>
 Let all men speak, and let all praise him for his righteousness.  <span class="verse" rel="v04013  009" id="13  009" >9</span>
 O Jerusalem, the holy city, he will scourge you for your children's works, and will have mercy again on the sons of the righteous.  <span class="verse" rel="v04013  010" id="13  010" >10</span>
 Give praise to the Lord, for he is good: and praise the everlasting King, that his tabernacle may be builded in you again with joy, and let him make joyful there in you those that are captives, and love in you for ever those that are miserable.  <span class="verse" rel="v04013  011" id="13  011" >11</span>
 Many nations shall come from far to the name of the Lord God with gifts in their hands, even gifts to the King of heaven; all generations shall praise you with great joy.  <span class="verse" rel="v04013  012" id="13  012" >12</span>
 Cursed are all they which hate you, and blessed shall all be which love you for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v04013  013" id="13  013" >13</span>
 Rejoice and be glad for the children of the just: for they shall be gathered together, and shall bless the Lord of the just.  <span class="verse" rel="v04013  014" id="13  014" >14</span>
 O blessed are they which love you, for they shall rejoice in your peace: blessed are they which have been sorrowful for all your scourges; for they shall rejoice for you, when they have seen all your glory, and shall be glad for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v04013  015" id="13  015" >15</span>
 Let my soul bless God the great King.  <span class="verse" rel="v04013  016" id="13  016" >16</span>
 For Jerusalem shall be built up with sapphires and emeralds, and precious stone: your walls and towers and battlements with pure gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v04013  017" id="13  017" >17</span>
 And the streets of Jerusalem shall be paved with beryl and carbuncle and stones of Ophir.  <span class="verse" rel="v04013  018" id="13  018" >18</span>
 And all her streets shall say, Alleluia; and they shall praise him, saying, Blessed be God, which has extolled it for ever.  
<!-- 14   018 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="14  001">14  </span> So Tobit made an end of praising God.  <span class="verse" rel="v04014  002" id="14  002" >2</span>
 And he was eight and fifty years old when he lost his sight, which was restored to him after eight years: and he gave alms, and he increased in the fear of the Lord God, and praised him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04014  003" id="14  003" >3</span>
 And when he was very aged he called his son, and the sons of his son, and said to him, My son, take your children; for, behold, I am aged, and am ready to depart out of this life.  <span class="verse" rel="v04014  004" id="14  004" >4</span>
 Go into Media my son, for I surely believe those things which Jonas the prophet spoke of Nineve, that it shall be overthrown; and that for a time peace shall rather be in Media; and that our brethren shall lie scattered in the earth from that good land: and Jerusalem shall be desolate, and the house of God in it shall be burned, and shall be desolate for a time;  <span class="verse" rel="v04014  005" id="14  005" >5</span>
 And that again God will have mercy on them, and bring them again into the land, where they shall build a temple, but not like to the first, until the time of that age be fulfilled; and afterward they shall return from all places of their captivity, and build up Jerusalem gloriously, and the house of God shall be built in it for ever with a glorious building, as the prophets have spoken thereof.  <span class="verse" rel="v04014  006" id="14  006" >6</span>
 And all nations shall turn, and fear the Lord God truly, and shall bury their idols.  <span class="verse" rel="v04014  007" id="14  007" >7</span>
 So shall all nations praise the Lord, and his people shall confess God, and the Lord shall exalt his people; and all those which love the Lord God in truth and justice shall rejoice, showing mercy to our brethren.  <span class="verse" rel="v04014  008" id="14  008" >8</span>
 And now, my son, depart out of Nineve, because that those things which the prophet Jonas spoke shall surely come to pass.  <span class="verse" rel="v04014  009" id="14  009" >9</span>
 But keep you the law and the commandments, and show yourself merciful and just, that it may go well with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v04014  010" id="14  010" >10</span>
 And bury me decently, and your mother with me; but wait no longer at Nineve. Remember, my son, how Aman handled Achiacharus that brought him up, how out of light he brought him into darkness, and how he rewarded him again: yet Achiacharus was saved, but the other had his reward: for he went down into darkness. Manasses gave alms, and escaped the snares of death which they had set for him: but Aman fell into the snare, and perished.  <span class="verse" rel="v04014  011" id="14  011" >11</span>
 Therefore now, my son, consider what alms does, and how righteousness does deliver. When he had said these things, he gave up the ghost in the bed, being an hundred and eight and fifty years old; and he buried him honorably.  <span class="verse" rel="v04014  012" id="14  012" >12</span>
 And when Anna his mother was dead, he buried her with his father. But Tobias departed with his wife and children to Ecbatane to Raguel his father in law,  <span class="verse" rel="v04014  013" id="14  013" >13</span>
 Where he became old with honor, and he buried his father and mother in law honorably, and he inherited their substance, and his father Tobit's.  <span class="verse" rel="v04014  014" id="14  014" >14</span>
 And he died at Ecbatane in Media, being an hundred and seven and twenty years old.  <span class="verse" rel="v04014  015" id="14  015" >15</span>
 But before he died he heard of the destruction of Nineve, which was taken by Nabuchodonosor and Assuerus: and before his death he rejoiced over Nineve.
