<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">T</span>he words of the Preacher, the son of David, king of Israel in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0211  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 Vanity of vanities, said the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0211  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 What advantage   is there   to a man in all his labor that he takes under the sun?  <span class="verse" rel="v0211  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 A generation goes, and a generation comes: but the earth stands for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0211  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 And the sun arises, and the sun goes down and draws toward its place;  <span class="verse" rel="v0211  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 arising there it proceeds southward, and goes round toward the north. The wind goes round and round, and the wind returns to its circuits.  <span class="verse" rel="v0211  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 All the rivers run into the sea; and yet the sea is not filled: to the place whence the rivers come, there they return again.  <span class="verse" rel="v0211  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 All things are full of labor; a man will not be able to speak   of them  : neither shall the eye be satisfied with seeing, neither shall the ear be filled with hearing.  <span class="verse" rel="v0211  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 What is that which has been? the very thing which shall be: and what is that which has been done? the very thing which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.  <span class="verse" rel="v0211  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
    Who is he   that shall speak and say, Behold, this is new? it has already been in the ages that have passed before us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0211  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 There is no memorial to the first things; neither to the things that have been last shall their memorial be with them that shall at the last   time  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0211  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0211  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 And I applied my heart to seek out and examine by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven, for God has given to the sons of men an evil trouble to be troubled therewith.  <span class="verse" rel="v0211  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 I [*]saw all the works that were wrought under the sun; and, [*]saw, all were vanity and waywardness of spirit.  <span class="verse" rel="v0211  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 That which is crooked can’t be made straight: and deficiency can’t be numbered.  <span class="verse" rel="v0211  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 I spoke in my heart, saying, Behold, I am increased, and have acquired wisdom beyond all who were before me in Jerusalem: also I applied my heart to know wisdom and knowledge.  <span class="verse" rel="v0211  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 And my heart knew much—wisdom, and knowledge, parables and understanding: I perceived that this also is waywardness of spirit.  <span class="verse" rel="v0211  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 For in the abundance of wisdom is abundance of knowledge; and he that increases knowledge will increase sorrow.  
<!-- 2   018 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove you with mirth, and behold you good: and, behold, this is also vanity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 I said to laughter, Madness: and to mirth, Why do you this:  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 And I examined whether my heart would excite my flesh as   with   wine, (though my heart guided   me   in wisdom,) and   I desired   to lay hold of mirth, until I should see of what kind is the good to the sons of men, which they should do under the sun all the days of their life.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 I enlarged my work; I built me houses; I planted me vineyards.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 I made me gardens and orchards, and planted in them every kind of fruit tree.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 I made me pools of water, to water from them the timber-bearing wood.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 I got servants and maidens, and servants were born to me in the house: also I had abundant possession of flocks and herds, beyond all who were before me in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 Moreover I collected for myself both silver and gold also, and the peculiar treasures of kings and provinces: I procured me singing men and singing women, and delights of the sons of men, a butler and female cupbearers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 So I became great, and advanced beyond all that were before in Jerusalem: also my wisdom was established to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 And whatever my eyes desired, I withheld not from them, I withheld not my heart from all my mirth: for my heart rejoiced in all my labor; and this was my portion of all my labor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 And I looked on all my works which my hands had wrought, and on my labor which I laboured to perform: and behold, all was vanity and waywardness of spirit, and there is no advantage under the sun.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 Then I looked on to see wisdom, and madness, and folly: for who is the man who will follow after counsel, in all things where in he employs it?  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 And I saw that wisdom excels folly, as much as light excels darkness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walks in darkness: and I perceived, even I, that one event shall happen to them all.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 And I said in my heart, As the event of the fool is, so shall it be to me, even to me: and to what purpose have I gained wisdom? I said moreover in my heart, This is also vanity, because the fool speaks of his abundance.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 For there is no remembrance of the wise man with the fool for ever; forasmuch as now   in   the coming days all things are forgotten: and how shall the wise man die with the fool?  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 So I hated life; because the work that was wrought under the sun was evil before me: for all is vanity and waywardness of spirit.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 And I hated the whole of my labor which I took under the sun; because I must leave it to the man who will come after me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 And who knows whether he will be a wise   man   or a fool? and whether he will have power over all my labor in which I laboured, and wherein I grew wise under the sun? this is also vanity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 so I went about to dismiss from my heart all my labor wherein I had laboured under the sun.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 For there is   such   a man that his labor is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in fortitude;   yet   this man shall give his portion to one who has not laboured therein. This is also vanity and great evil.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 For it happens to a man in all his labor, and in the purpose of his heart wherein he labors under the sun.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  023" id="2  023" >23</span>
 For all his days   are days   of sorrows, and vexation of spirit is his; in the night also his heart rests not. This is also vanity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  024" id="2  024" >24</span>
 A man has nothing   really   good to eat, and to drink, and to show his soul   as   good in his trouble. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  025" id="2  025" >25</span>
 For who shall eat, or who shall drink, without him?  <span class="verse" rel="v0212  026" id="2  026" >26</span>
 For   God   has given to the man who is good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but he has given to the sinner trouble, to add and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God; for this is also vanity and waywardness of spirit.

<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> To all things there is a time, and a season for every matter under heaven.  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 A time of birth, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what has been planted;  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to pull down, and a time to build up;  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to lament, and a time to dance;  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 a time to throw stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to abstain from embracing;  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to be silent, and a time to speak;  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 a time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 What advantage   has   he that works in those things wherein he labors?  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 I have seen all the trouble, which God has given to the sons of men to be troubled with.  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 All the things which he has made are beautiful in his time: he has also set the whole world in their heart, that man might not find out the work which God has wrought from the beginning even to the end.  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 I know that there is no good in them, except   for a man   to rejoice, and to do good in his life.  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 Also   in the case of   every man who shall eat and drink, and see good in all his labor,   this   is a gift of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 I know that whatever things God has done, they shall be for ever: it is impossible to add to it, and it is impossible to take away from it: and God has done   it  , that   men   may fear before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 That which has been is now; and whatever things   are appointed   to be have already been; and God will seek out that which is past.  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, there was the ungodly one; and the place of righteousness, there was the godly one.  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 And I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the ungodly: for there is a time there for every action and for every work.  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 I said in my heart, concerning the speech of the sons of man, God will judge them, and that to show that they are breasts.  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  019" id="3  019" >19</span>
 Also to them is the event of the sons of man, and the event of the brute; one event befalls them: as is the death of the one, so also the death of the other; and there is one breath to all: and what has the man more than the brute? nothing; for all is vanity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  020" id="3  020" >20</span>
 All   go   to one place; all were formed of the dust, and all will return to dust.  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  021" id="3  021" >21</span>
 And who has seen the spirit of the sons of man, whether it goes upward? and the spirit of the beast, whether it goes downward to the earth?  <span class="verse" rel="v0213  022" id="3  022" >22</span>
 And I saw that there was no good, but that wherein a man shall rejoice in his works, for it is his portion, for who shall bring him to see any thing of that which shall be after him?  
<!-- 4   022 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> So I returned, and saw all the oppressions that were done under the sun: and behold the tear of the oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of them that oppressed them was power; but they had no comforter:  <span class="verse" rel="v0214  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 and I praised all the dead that had already died more than the living, as many as are alive until now.  <span class="verse" rel="v0214  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 Better also than both these is he who has not yet been, who has not seen all the evil work that is done under the sun.  <span class="verse" rel="v0214  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 And I saw all labor, and all the diligent work, that this is a man's envy from his neighbor. This is also vanity and waywardness of spirit.  <span class="verse" rel="v0214  005" id="4  005" >5</span>
 The fool folds his hands together, and eats his own flesh.  <span class="verse" rel="v0214  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 Better is a handful of rest than two handfuls of trouble and waywardness of spirit.  <span class="verse" rel="v0214  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 So I returned, and saw vanity under the sun.  <span class="verse" rel="v0214  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 There is one   alone  , and there is not a second; yes, he has neither son nor brother: yet there is no end to all his labor; neither is his eye satisfied with wealth; and for whom do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? this is also vanity, and an evil trouble.  <span class="verse" rel="v0214  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 Two   are   better than one,   seeing   they have a good reward for their labor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0214  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falls, and there is not a second to lift him up.  <span class="verse" rel="v0214  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 Also if two should lie together, they also get heat: but how shall one be warmed   alone?    <span class="verse" rel="v0214  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 And if one should prevail against   him  , the two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord shall not be quickly broken.  <span class="verse" rel="v0214  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 Better is a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king, who knows not how to take heed any longer.  <span class="verse" rel="v0214  014" id="4  014" >14</span>
 For he shall come forth out of the house of the prisoners to reign, because   he   also that was in his kingdom has become poor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0214  015" id="4  015" >15</span>
 I [*]saw all the living who were walking under the sun, with the second youth who shall stand up in each one's place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0214  016" id="4  016" >16</span>
 There is no end to all the people, to all who were before them: and the last shall not rejoice in him: for this also is vanity and waywardness of spirit.  <span class="verse" rel="v0214  017" id="4  017" >17</span>
 Keep your foot, whenever you go to the house of God; and   when you are   near to hear, let your sacrifice   be   better than the gift of fools: for they know not that they are doing evil.

<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> Be not hasty with your mouth, and let not your heart be swift to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven above, and you upon earth: therefore let your words be few.  <span class="verse" rel="v0215  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 For through the multitude of trial a dream comes; and a fool's voice is with a multitude of words.  <span class="verse" rel="v0215  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 Whenever you shall vow a vow to God, defer not to pay it; for   he has   no pleasure in fools: pay you therefore whatever you shall have vowed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0215  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
    It is   better that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay.  <span class="verse" rel="v0215  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 Suffer not your mouth to lead your flesh to sin; and say not in the presence of God, It was an error: lest God be angry at your voice, and destroy the works of your hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v0215  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 For   there is evil   in a multitude of dreams and vanities and many words: but fear you God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0215  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 If you should see the oppression of the poor, and the wresting of judgment and of justice in the land, wonder not at the matter: for   there is   a high one to watch over him that is high, and high ones over them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0215  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 Also the abundance of the earth is for every one: the king   is dependent on   the tilled field.  <span class="verse" rel="v0215  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 He that loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver: and who has loved gain, in the abundance thereof? this is also vanity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0215  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 In the multitude of good they are increased that eat it: and what virtue has the owner, but the right of beholding   it   with his eyes?  <span class="verse" rel="v0215  011" id="5  011" >11</span>
 The sleep of a servant is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but to one who is satiated with wealth, there is none that suffers him to sleep.  <span class="verse" rel="v0215  012" id="5  012" >12</span>
 There is an infirmity which I have seen under the sun,   namely  , wealth kept for its owner to his hurt.  <span class="verse" rel="v0215  013" id="5  013" >13</span>
 And that wealth shall perish in an evil trouble: and   the man   begets a son, and there is nothing in his hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0215  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 As he came forth naked from his mother's womb, he shall return back as he came, and he shall receive nothing for his labor, that it should go   with him   in his hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0215  015" id="5  015" >15</span>
 And this is also an evil infirmity: for as he came, so also shall he return: and what is his gain, for which he vainly labors?  <span class="verse" rel="v0215  016" id="5  016" >16</span>
 Yes, all his days are in darkness, and in mourning, and much sorrow, and infirmity, and wrath.  <span class="verse" rel="v0215  017" id="5  017" >17</span>
 Behold, I have seen good, that it is a fine thing   for a man   to eat and to drink, and to see good in all his labor in which he may labor under the sun,   all   the number of the days of his life which God has given to him: for it is his portion.  <span class="verse" rel="v0215  018" id="5  018" >18</span>
 Yes, and   as for   every man to whom God has given wealth and possessions, and has given him power to eat thereof, and to receive his portion, and to rejoice in his labor; this is the gift of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0215  019" id="5  019" >19</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="6  001">6  </span> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is abundant with man:  <span class="verse" rel="v0216  002" id="6  002" >2</span>
 a man to whom God shall give wealth, and substance, and honor, and he wants nothing for his soul of all things that he shall desire, yet God shall not give him power to eat of it, for a stranger shall devour it: this is vanity, and an evil infirmity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0216  003" id="6  003" >3</span>
 If a man beget a hundred   children  , and live many years, yes, however abundant the days of his years shall be, yet   if   his soul shall not be satisfied with good, and also he have no burial; I said, An untimely birth is better than he.  <span class="verse" rel="v0216  004" id="6  004" >4</span>
 For he came in vanity, and departs in darkness, and his name shall be covered in darkness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0216  005" id="6  005" >5</span>
 Moreover he has not seen the sun, nor known rest: there is   no more rest   to this one than another.  <span class="verse" rel="v0216  006" id="6  006" >6</span>
 Though he has lived to the return of a thousand years, yet he has seen no good: do not all go to one place?  <span class="verse" rel="v0216  007" id="6  007" >7</span>
 All the labor of a man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite shall not be satisfied.  <span class="verse" rel="v0216  008" id="6  008" >8</span>

 The sight of the eyes is better than that which wanders in soul: this is also vanity, and waywardness of spirit.  <span class="verse" rel="v0216  010" id="6  010" >10</span>
 If anything has been, its name has already been called: and it is known what man is; neither can he contend with him who is stronger than he.  <span class="verse" rel="v0216  011" id="6  011" >11</span>
 For there are many things which increase vanity.  
<!-- 7   011 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="7  001">7  </span> What advantage has a man? for who knows   what is   good for a man in his life,   during   the number of the life of the days of his vanity? and he has spent them as a shadow; for who shall tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  002" id="7  002" >2</span>
 A good name is better than good oil; and the day of death than the day of birth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  003" id="7  003" >3</span>
    It is   better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the banquet house: since this is the end of every man; and the living man will apply good   warning   to his heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  004" id="7  004" >4</span>
 Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart will be made better.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  005" id="7  005" >5</span>
 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  006" id="7  006" >6</span>
    It is   better to hear a reproof of a wise man, than for a man to hear the song of fools.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  007" id="7  007" >7</span>
 As the sound of thorns under a caldron, so is the laughter of fools: this is also vanity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  008" id="7  008" >8</span>
 for oppression makes a wise man mad, and destroys his noble heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  009" id="7  009" >9</span>
 The end of a matter is better than the beginning thereof: the patient is better than the high-minded.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  010" id="7  010" >10</span>
 Be not hasty in your spirit to be angry: for anger will rest in the bosom of fools.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  011" id="7  011" >11</span>
 Say not, What has happened, that the former days were better than these? for you do not enquire in wisdom concerning this.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  012" id="7  012" >12</span>
 Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and   there is   an advantage   by it   to them that see the sun.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  013" id="7  013" >13</span>
 For wisdom in its shadow is as the shadow of silver: and the excellence of the knowledge of wisdom will give life to him that has it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  014" id="7  014" >14</span>
 Behold the works of God: for who shall be able to straighten him whom God has made crooked?  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  015" id="7  015" >15</span>
 In the day of prosperity live joyfully, and consider in the day of adversity: consider,   I say  , God also has caused the one to agree with the other for   this   reason, that man should find nothing after him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  016" id="7  016" >16</span>
 I have seen all things in the days of my vanity: there is a just man perishing in his justice, and there is an ungodly man remaining in his wickedness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  017" id="7  017" >17</span>
 Be not very just; neither be very wise: lest you be confounded.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  018" id="7  018" >18</span>
 Be not very wicked; and be not stubborn: lest you should die before your time.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  019" id="7  019" >19</span>
 It is well for you to hold fast by this; also by this defile not your hand: for to them that fear God all things shall come forth   well  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  020" id="7  020" >20</span>
 Wisdom will help the wise man more than ten mighty men which are in the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  021" id="7  021" >21</span>
 For there is not a righteous man in the earth, who will do good, and not sin  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  022" id="7  022" >22</span>
 Also take no heed to all the words which ungodly men shall speak; lest you hear your servant cursing you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  023" id="7  023" >23</span>
 For many times he shall trespass against you, and repeatedly shall he afflict your heart; for thus also have you cursed others.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  024" id="7  024" >24</span>
 All these things have I proved in wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  025" id="7  025" >25</span>
    That which is   far beyond what was, and a great depth, who shall find it out?  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  026" id="7  026" >26</span>
 I and my heart went round about to know, and to examine, and to seek wisdom, and the account   of things  , and to know the folly and trouble and madness of the ungodly man.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  027" id="7  027" >27</span>
 And I find her   to be  , and I will pronounce   to be   more bitter than death the woman which is a snare, and her heart nets,   who has   a band in her hands:   he that is   good in the sight of God shall be delivered from her; but the sinner shall be caught by her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  028" id="7  028" >28</span>
 Behold, this have I found, said the Preacher,   seeking   by one at a time to find out the account,  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  029" id="7  029" >29</span>
 which my soul sought after, but I found not: for I have found one man of a thousand; but a woman in all these I have not found.  <span class="verse" rel="v0217  030" id="7  030" >30</span>
 But, behold, this have I found, that God made man upright; but they have sought out many devices.

<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> Who knows the wise? and who knows the interpretation of a saying? A man's wisdom will lighten his countenance; but a man of shameless countenance will be hated.  <span class="verse" rel="v0218  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 Observe the commandment of the king, and   that   because of the word of the oath of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0218  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 Be not hasty; you shall go forth out of his presence: stand not in an evil matter; for he will do whatever he shall please,  <span class="verse" rel="v0218  004" id="8  004" >4</span>
 even as a king having power: and who will say to him, What do you?  <span class="verse" rel="v0218  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 He that keeps the commandment shall not know an evil thing: and the heart of the wise knows the time of judgment.  <span class="verse" rel="v0218  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 For to every thing there is time and judgment; for the knowledge of a man is great to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0218  007" id="8  007" >7</span>
 For there is no one that knows what is going to be: for who shall tell him how it shall be?  <span class="verse" rel="v0218  008" id="8  008" >8</span>
 There is no man that has power over the spirit to retain the spirit; and there is no power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in the day of the battle; neither shall ungodliness save her votary.  <span class="verse" rel="v0218  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 So I saw all this, and I applied my heart to every work that has been done under the sun; all the things wherein man has power over man to afflict him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0218  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 And then I saw the ungodly carried into the tombs, and   that   out of the holy place: and they departed, and were praised in the city, because they had done thus: this also is vanity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0218  011" id="8  011" >11</span>
 Because there is no contradiction made on the part of those who do evil quickly, therefore the heart of the children of men is fully determined in them to do evil.  <span class="verse" rel="v0218  012" id="8  012" >12</span>
 He that has sinned has done evil from that time, and long from beforehand: nevertheless I know, that it is well with them that fear God, that they may fear before him:  <span class="verse" rel="v0218  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 but it shall not be well with the ungodly, and he shall not prolong his days,   which are   as a shadow; forasmuch as he fears not before God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0218  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there are righteous persons to whom it happens according to the doing of the ungodly; and there are ungodly men, to whom it happens according to the doing of the just: I said, This is also vanity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0218  015" id="8  015" >15</span>
 Then I praised mirth, because there is no good for a man under the sun, but to eat, and drink, and be merry: and this shall attend him in his labor all the days of his life, which God has given him under the sun.  <span class="verse" rel="v0218  016" id="8  016" >16</span>
 Whereupon I set my heart to know wisdom, and to perceive the trouble that was wrought upon the earth: for there is that neither by day nor night sees sleep with his eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0218  017" id="8  017" >17</span>
 And I [*]saw all the works of God, that a man shall not be able to discover the work which is wrought under the sun; whatever things a man shall endeavor to seek, however a man may labor to seek it, yet he shall not find it; yes, how much soever a wise man may speak of knowing it, he shall not be able to find it: for I applied all this to my heart, and my heart has seen all this.  
<!-- 9   017 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="9  001">9  </span>    I saw   that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: yes, there is no man that knows either love or hatred,   though   all are before their face.  <span class="verse" rel="v0219  002" id="9  002" >2</span>
 Vanity is in all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good, and to the bad; both to the pure, and to the impure; both to him that sacrifices, and to him that sacrifice not: as is the good, so is the sinner: as is the swearer, even so is he that fears an oath.  <span class="verse" rel="v0219  003" id="9  003" >3</span>
 There is this evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event to all: yes, the heart of the sons of men is filled with evil, and madness is in their heart during their life, and after that   they go   to the dead.  <span class="verse" rel="v0219  004" id="9  004" >4</span>
 for who is he that has fellowship with all the living? there is hope   of him  : for a living dog is better than a dead lion.  <span class="verse" rel="v0219  005" id="9  005" >5</span>
 For the living will know that they shall die: but the dead know nothing, and there is no longer any reward to them; for their memory is lost.  <span class="verse" rel="v0219  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
 also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, have now perished; yes, there is no portion for them any more for ever in all that is done under the sun.  <span class="verse" rel="v0219  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 Go, eat your bread with mirth, and drink your wine with a joyful heart; for now God has favourably accepted your works.  <span class="verse" rel="v0219  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 Let your garments be always white; and let not oil be lacking on your head.  <span class="verse" rel="v0219  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 And see life with the wife whom you love all the days of the life of your vanity, which are given you under the sun: for that is your portion in your life, and in your labor wherein you labor under the sun.  <span class="verse" rel="v0219  010" id="9  010" >10</span>
 Whatsoever your hand shall find to do, do with all your might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in Hades wither you go.  <span class="verse" rel="v0219  011" id="9  011" >11</span>
 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor yet bread to the wise, nor yet wealth to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of knowledge; for time and chance will happen to them all.  <span class="verse" rel="v0219  012" id="9  012" >12</span>
 For surely man also knows not his time: as fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as birds that are caught in a snare; even thus the sons of men are snared at an evil time, when it falls suddenly upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0219  013" id="9  013" >13</span>
 This I also saw   to be   wisdom under the sun, and it is great before me:  <span class="verse" rel="v0219  014" id="9  014" >14</span>
    suppose there were   a little city, and few men in it; and there should come against it a great king, and surround it, and build great mounds against it;  <span class="verse" rel="v0219  015" id="9  015" >15</span>
 and should find in it a poor wise man, and he should save the city through his wisdom: yet no man would remember that poor man.  <span class="verse" rel="v0219  016" id="9  016" >16</span>
 And I said Wisdom is better than power: yet the wisdom of the poor man is set at nothing, and his words not listened to.  <span class="verse" rel="v0219  017" id="9  017" >17</span>
 The words of the wise are heard in quiet more than the cry of them that rule in folly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0219  018" id="9  018" >18</span>
 Wisdom is better than weapons of war: and one sinner will destroy much good.

 By slothful neglect a building will be brought low: and by idleness of the hands the house will fall to pieces.  <span class="verse" rel="v02110  019" id="10  019" >19</span>
 Men prepare bread for laughter, and wine and oil that the living should rejoice: but to money all things will humbly yield obedience.  <span class="verse" rel="v02110  020" id="10  020" >20</span>
 Even in your conscience, curse not the king; and curse not the rich in your bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry your voice, and that which has wings shall report your speech.

<p><span class="chapter" id="11  001">11  </span> Send forth your bread upon the face of the water: for you shall find it after many days.  <span class="verse" rel="v02111  002" id="11  002" >2</span>
 Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for you know not what evil there shall be upon the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02111  003" id="11  003" >3</span>
 If the clouds be filled with rain, they pour   it   out upon the earth: and if a tree fall southward, or if it fall northward, in the place where the tree shall fall, there it shall be.  <span class="verse" rel="v02111  004" id="11  004" >4</span>
 He that observes the wind sows not; and he that looks at the clouds will not reap.  <span class="verse" rel="v02111  005" id="11  005" >5</span>
 Among whom none knows what is the way of the wind: as the bones   are hid   in the womb of a pregnant   woman  , so you shall not know the works of God,   even   all things whatever he shall do.  <span class="verse" rel="v02111  006" id="11  006" >6</span>
 In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening let not your hand be slack: for you know not what sort shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether both shall be good alike.  <span class="verse" rel="v02111  007" id="11  007" >7</span>
 Moreover the light is sweet, and it is good for the eyes to see the sun.  <span class="verse" rel="v02111  008" id="11  008" >8</span>
 For even if a man should live many years,   and   rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that comes is vanity.  <span class="verse" rel="v02111  009" id="11  009" >9</span>
 Rejoice, O young man, in your youth; and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart blameless, but not in the sight of your eyes: yet know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.  <span class="verse" rel="v02111  010" id="11  010" >10</span>
 Therefore remove sorrow from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh: for youth and folly are vanity.

<p><span class="chapter" id="12  001">12  </span> And remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the days of evil come, and the years overtake   you   in which you shall say, I have no pleasure in them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02112  002" id="12  002" >2</span>
 While the sun and light are not darkened, nor the moon and the stars; nor the clouds return after the rain:  <span class="verse" rel="v02112  003" id="12  003" >3</span>
 in the day wherein the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the mighty men shall become bent, and the grinding   women   cease because they have become few, and the   women   looking out at the windows be dark;  <span class="verse" rel="v02112  004" id="12  004" >4</span>
 and they shall shut the doors in the marketplace, because of the weakness of the voice of her that grinds   at the mill  ; and he shall rise up at the voice of the sparrow, and all the daughters of song shall be brought low;  <span class="verse" rel="v02112  005" id="12  005" >5</span>
 and they shall look up, and fears   shall be   in the way, and the almond tree shall blossom, and the locust shall increase, and the caper shall be scattered: because man has gone to his eternal home, and the mourners have gone about the market:  <span class="verse" rel="v02112  006" id="12  006" >6</span>
 before the silver cord be   let go  , or the choice gold be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel run down to the cistern;  <span class="verse" rel="v02112  007" id="12  007" >7</span>
    before   the dust also return to the earth as it was, and the spirit return to God who gave it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02112  008" id="12  008" >8</span>
 Vanity of vanities, said the Preacher; all is vanity.  <span class="verse" rel="v02112  009" id="12  009" >9</span>
 And because the Preacher was wise above   others, so it was   that he taught man excellent knowledge, and the ear will trace out the parables.  <span class="verse" rel="v02112  010" id="12  010" >10</span>
 The Preacher sought diligently to find out acceptable words, and a correct writing,   even   words of truth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02112  011" id="12  011" >11</span>
 The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails firmly fastened, which have been given from one shepherd by agreement.  <span class="verse" rel="v02112  012" id="12  012" >12</span>
 And moreover, my son, guard yourself by means of them: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.  <span class="verse" rel="v02112  013" id="12  013" >13</span>
 Hear the end of the matter, the sun: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole man.  <span class="verse" rel="v02112  014" id="12  014" >14</span>
 For God will bring every work into judgment, with everything that has been overlooked, whether   it be   good, or whether   it be   evil.
