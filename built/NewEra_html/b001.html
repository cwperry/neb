 And God formed yet farther out of the earth all the wild beasts of the field, and all the birds of the sky, and he brought them to Adam, to see what he would call them, and whatever Adam called any living creature,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. soul.  </span>  that was the name of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0012  020" id="2  020" >20</span>

 And God brought a trance upon Adam, and he slept, and he took one of his ribs, and filled up the flesh instead thereof.  <span class="verse" rel="v0012  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 And God  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. built.  </span>  formed the rib which he took from Adam into a woman, and brought her to Adam.

<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> And the two were naked, both Adam and his wife, and were not ashamed. Now the serpent was the most crafty of all the brutes on the earth, which the Lord God made, and the serpent said to the woman, Therefore has God said, Eat not of every tree of the garden?  <span class="verse" rel="v0013  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden,  <span class="verse" rel="v0013  003" id="3  003" >3</span>

 And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes to look upon and beautiful to contemplate, and having taken of its fruit she ate, and she gave to her husband also with her, and they ate.  <span class="verse" rel="v0013  007" id="3  007" >7</span>

 And Lot said to them, I pray, Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v001019019" id="019019" >19</span>
 since your servant has found mercy before you, and you have magnified your righteousness, in what you do towards me that my soul may live, —but I shall not be able to escape to the mountain, lest perhaps the calamity overtake me and I die.  <span class="verse" rel="v001019020" id="019020" >20</span>
 Behold this city is near for me to escape there, which is a small one, and there shall I be preserved, is it not little? and my soul shall live because of you.  
<!-- 019 020 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001019021" id="019021" >21</span>
 And he said to him, Behold, I have had respect to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. your countenance.  </span>  you also about this thing, that I should not overthrow the city about which you have spoken.  <span class="verse" rel="v001019022" id="019022" >22</span>
 Hasten therefore to escape there, for I shall not be able to do anything until you are come there; therefore he called the name of that city, Segor.  
<!-- 019 022 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001019023" id="019023" >23</span>
 The sun was risen upon the earth, when Lot entered into Segor.  <span class="verse" rel="v001019024" id="019024" >24</span>
 And the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrha brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.  <span class="verse" rel="v001019025" id="019025" >25</span>
 And he overthrew these cities, and all the country round about, and all that lived in the cities, and the plants springing out of the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v001019026" id="019026" >26</span>
 And his wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.  
<!-- 019 026 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001019027" id="019027" >27</span>
 And Abraam rose up early to go to the place, where he had stood before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v001019028" id="019028" >28</span>
 And he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha, and towards the surrounding country, and saw, and behold a flame went up from the earth, as the smoke of a furnace.  
<!-- 019 028 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001019029" id="019029" >29</span>
 And it came to pass that when God destroyed all the cities of the region round about, God remembered Abraam, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when the Lord overthrew those cities in which Lot lived.  
<!-- 019 029 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001019030" id="019030" >30</span>
 And Lot went up out of Segor, and lived in the mountain, he and his two daughters with him, for he feared to dwell in Segor; and he lived in a cave, he and his two daughters with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v001019031" id="019031" >31</span>
 And the elder said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is no one on the earth who shall come in to us, as it is fit in all the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v001019032" id="019032" >32</span>
 Come and let us make our father drink wine, and let us sleep with him, and let us raise up seed from our father.  
<!-- 019 032 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001019033" id="019033" >33</span>
 So they made their father drink wine in that night, and the elder went in and lay with her father that night, and he knew not when he slept and when he rose up.  <span class="verse" rel="v001019034" id="019034" >34</span>
 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the elder said to the younger, Behold, I slept yesternight with our father, let us make him drink wine in this night also, and do you go in and sleep with him, and let us raise up seed of our father.  <span class="verse" rel="v001019035" id="019035" >35</span>
 So they made their father drink wine in that night also, and the younger went in and slept with her father, and he knew not when he slept, nor when he arose.  
<!-- 019 035 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001019036" id="019036" >36</span>
 And the two daughters of Lot conceived by their father.  <span class="verse" rel="v001019037" id="019037" >37</span>
 And the elder bore a son and called his name Moab, saying,   He is   of my father. This is the father of the Moabites to this present day.  <span class="verse" rel="v001019038" id="019038" >38</span>
 And the younger also bore a son, and called his name Amman, saying, The son of my family. This is the father of the Ammanites to this present day.  <p>

<p><span class="chapter" id="020001">20</span> And Abraam removed thence to the southern country, and lived between Cades and Sur, and sojourned in Gerara.  <span class="verse" rel="v001020002" id="020002" >2</span>
 And Abraam said concerning Sarrha his wife, She is my sister, for he feared to say, She is my wife, lest at any time the men of the city should kill him for her sake. So Abimelech king of Gerara sent and took Sarrha.  
<!-- 020 002 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001020003" id="020003" >3</span>
 And God came to Abimelech by night in sleep, and said, Behold, you die for the woman, whom you have taken, whereas she has lived with a husband.  
<!-- 020 003 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001020004" id="020004" >4</span>
 But Abimelech had not touched her, and he said, Lord, will you destroy an ignorantly   sinning   and just nation?  <span class="verse" rel="v001020005" id="020005" >5</span>
 Said he not to me, She is my sister, and said she not to me, He is my brother? with a pure heart and in the righteousness of my hands have I done this.  
<!-- 020 005 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001020006" id="020006" >6</span>
 And God said to him in sleep, Yes, I knew that you did this with a pure heart, and I spared you, so that you should not sin against me, therefore I suffered you not to touch her.  <span class="verse" rel="v001020007" id="020007" >7</span>
 But now return the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and shall pray for you, and you shall live; but if you restore her not, know that you shall die and all your.  
<!-- 020 007 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001020008" id="020008" >8</span>
 And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and he spoke all these words in their ears, and all the men feared exceedingly.  <span class="verse" rel="v001020009" id="020009" >9</span>
 And Abimelech called Abraam and said to him, What is this that you have done to us? Have we sinned against you, that you have brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me a deed, which no one ought to do.  <span class="verse" rel="v001020010" id="020010" >10</span>
 And Abimelech said to Abraam, What have you seen in   me   that you have done this?  
<!-- 020 010 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001020011" id="020011" >11</span>
 And Abraam said, Why I said, Surely there is not the worship of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v001020012" id="020012" >12</span>
 For truly she is my sister by my father, but not by my mother, and she became my wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v001020013" id="020013" >13</span>
 And it came to pass when God brought me forth out of the house of my father, that I said to her, This righteousness you shall perform to me, in every place into which we may enter, say of me, He is my brother.  
<!-- 020 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001020014" id="020014" >14</span>
 And Abimelech took a thousand  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. didrachma.  </span>  pieces of silver, and sheep, and calves, and servants, and maidservants, and gave them to Abraam, and he returned him Sarrha his wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v001020015" id="020015" >15</span>
 And Abimelech said to Abraam, Behold, my land is before you, dwell wherever it may please you.  
<!-- 020 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001020016" id="020016" >16</span>
 And to Sarrha he said, Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver, those shall be to you for the price of your countenance, and to all the women with you, and speak the truth in all things.  
<!-- 020 016 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001020017" id="020017" >17</span>
 And Abraam prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his women servants, and they bore children.  <span class="verse" rel="v001020018" id="020018" >18</span>
 Because the Lord had fast closed from without every womb in the house of Abimelech, because of Sarrha Abraam's wife.  <p>
<!-- 021 018 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="021001">21</span> And the Lord visited Sarrha, as he said, and the Lord did to Sarrha, as he spoke.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021002" id="021002" >2</span>
 And she conceived and bore to Abraam a son in old age, at the set time according as the Lord spoke to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021003" id="021003" >3</span>
 And Abraam called the name of his son that was born to him, whom Sarrha bore to him, Isaac.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021004" id="021004" >4</span>
 And Abraam circumcised Isaac on the eighth day, as God commanded him.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021005" id="021005" >5</span>
 And Abraam was a hundred years old when Isaac his son was born to him.  
<!-- 021 005 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001021006" id="021006" >6</span>
 And Sarrha said, The Lord has made laughter for me, for whoever shall hear shall rejoice with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021007" id="021007" >7</span>
 And she said, Who shall say to Abraam that Sarrha suckles a child? for I have born a child in my old age.  
<!-- 021 007 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001021008" id="021008" >8</span>
 And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraam made a great feast the day that his son Isaac was weaned.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021009" id="021009" >9</span>
 And Sarrha having seen the son of Agar the Egyptian who was born to Abraam, sporting with Isaac her son,  <span class="verse" rel="v001021010" id="021010" >10</span>
 then she said to Abraam,          Gal 4:30    Cast out this bondwoman and her son, for the son of this bondwoman shall not inherit with my son Isaac.  
<!-- 021 010 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001021011" id="021011" >11</span>
 But the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. Gr. saying, or matter.  </span>  word appeared very hard before Abraam concerning his son.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021012" id="021012" >12</span>
 But God said to Abraam, Let it not be hard before you concerning the child, and concerning the bondwoman; in all things whatever Sarrha shall say to you, hear her voice, for          Rom 9:7    in Isaac shall your seed be called.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021013" id="021013" >13</span>
 And moreover I will make the son of this bondwoman a great nation, because he is your seed.  
<!-- 021 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001021014" id="021014" >14</span>
 And Abraam rose up in the morning and took loaves and a skin of water, and gave   them   to Agar, and he put the child on her shoulder, and sent her away, and she having departed wandered in the wilderness  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, near Beersheba.  </span>  near the well of the oath.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021015" id="021015" >15</span>
 And the water failed out of the skin, and she cast the child under a fir tree.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021016" id="021016" >16</span>
 And she departed and sat down opposite him at a distance, as it were a bow-shot, for she said, Surely I can’t see the death of my child: and she sat opposite him, and the child cried aloud and wept.  
<!-- 021 016 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001021017" id="021017" >17</span>
 And God heard the voice of the child from the place where he was, and an angel of God called Agar out of heaven, and said to her, What is it, Agar? fear not, for God has heard the voice of the child from the place where he is.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021018" id="021018" >18</span>
 Rise up, and take the child, and hold him in your hand, for I will make him a great nation.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021019" id="021019" >19</span>
 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, Gr. living.  </span>  of springing water; and she went and filled the skin with water, and gave the child drink.  
<!-- 021 019 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001021020" id="021020" >20</span>
 And God was with the child, and he grew and lived in the wilderness, and became an archer.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021021" id="021021" >21</span>
 And he lived in the wilderness, and his mother took him a wife out of Pharan of Egypt.  
<!-- 021 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001021022" id="021022" >22</span>
 And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech spoke, and Ochozath  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Not in the Heb. friend of bridegroom, or attendant at marriage.  </span>  his friend, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, to Abraam, saying, God is with you in all things, whatever you may do.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021023" id="021023" >23</span>
 Now therefore swear to me by God that you will not injure me, nor my seed, nor my name, but according to the righteousness which I have performed with you you shall deal with me, and with the land in which you have sojourned.  
<!-- 021 023 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001021024" id="021024" >24</span>
 And Abraam said, I will swear.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021025" id="021025" >25</span>
 And Abraam reproved Abimelech because of the wells of water, which the servants of Abimelech took away.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021026" id="021026" >26</span>
 And Abimelech said to him, I know not who has done this thing to you, neither did you tell it me, neither heard I it but only today.  
<!-- 021 026 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001021027" id="021027" >27</span>
 And Abraam took sheep and calves, and gave them to Abimelech, and both made a covenant.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021028" id="021028" >28</span>
 And Abraam set seven ewe-lambs by themselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021029" id="021029" >29</span>
 And Abimelech said to Abraam, What are these seven ewe-lambs which you have set alone?  <span class="verse" rel="v001021030" id="021030" >30</span>
 And Abraam said, You shall receive the seven ewe-lambs of me, that they may be for me as a witness, that I dug this well.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021031" id="021031" >31</span>
 Therefore he named the name of that place, The Well of the Oath, for there they both swore.  
<!-- 021 031 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001021032" id="021032" >32</span>
 And they made a covenant at the well of the oath. And there rose up Abimelech, Ochozath his friend, and Phichol the commander-in-chief of his army, and they returned to the land of the Phylistines.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021033" id="021033" >33</span>
 And Abraam planted a field at the well of the oath, and called there on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God.  <span class="verse" rel="v001021034" id="021034" >34</span>

 And Abraam took the wood of the whole burnt offering, and laid it on Isaac his son, and he took into his hands both the fire and the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        μάχαιραν, a short dagger used both for defence and sacrifice, etc.  </span>  knife, and the two went together.  <span class="verse" rel="v001022007" id="022007" >7</span>
 And Isaac said to Abraam his father, Father. And he said, What is it, son? And he said, Behold the fire and the wood, where is the sheep for a whole burnt offering?  <span class="verse" rel="v001022008" id="022008" >8</span>
 And Abraam said, God will provide himself a sheep for a whole burnt offering,   my   son. And both having gone together,

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001022009" id="022009" >9</span>
 came to the place which God spoke of to him; and there Abraam built the altar, and laid the wood on it, and having bound the feet of Isaac his son together, he laid him on the altar upon the wood.  <span class="verse" rel="v001022010" id="022010" >10</span>
 And Abraam stretched forth his hand to take the knife to kill his son.  <span class="verse" rel="v001022011" id="022011" >11</span>
 And an angel of the Lord called him out of heaven, and said, Abraam, Abraam. And he said, Behold, I   am here  .  <span class="verse" rel="v001022012" id="022012" >12</span>
 And he said, Lay not your hand upon the child, neither do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, and for my sake you have not spared your beloved son.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001023007" id="023007" >7</span>
 And Abraam rose up and did obeisance to the people of the land, to the sons of Chet.  <span class="verse" rel="v001023008" id="023008" >8</span>
 And Abraam spoke to them, saying, If you° have it in your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, listen to me, and speak for me to Ephron the son Saar.  <span class="verse" rel="v001023009" id="023009" >9</span>
 And let him give me the double cave which he has, which is in a part of his field, let him give it me for the money it is worth for possession of a burying-place among you.  
<!-- 023 009 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001023010" id="023010" >10</span>
 Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Chet, and Ephron the Chettite answered Abraam and spoke in the hearing of the sons of Chet, and of all who entered the city, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v001023011" id="023011" >11</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. be with me.  </span>  Attend to me, my lord, and hear me, I give to you the field and the cave which is in it; I have given it you before all my country men; bury your dead.  
<!-- 023 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001023012" id="023012" >12</span>
 And Abraam did obeisance before the people of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v001023013" id="023013" >13</span>
 And he said in the ears of Ephron before the people of the land, Since you are on my side, hear me; take the price of the field from me, and I will bury my dead there.  
<!-- 023 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001023014" id="023014" >14</span>
 But Ephron answered Abraam, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v001023015" id="023015" >15</span>
 Nay, my lord, I have heard indeed, the land   is worth   four hundred silver didrachmas, but what can this be between me and you? nay, do you bury your dead.  
<!-- 023 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001023016" id="023016" >16</span>
 And Abraam listened to Ephron, and Abraam rendered to Ephron the money, which he mentioned in the ears of the sons of Chet, four hundred didrachmas of silver approved with merchants.  
<!-- 023 016 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001023017" id="023017" >17</span>
 And the field of Ephron, which was in Double Cave, which is opposite Mambre, the field and the cave, which was in it, and every tree which was in the field, and whatever is in its borders round about, were made sure in its borders round about, were made sure  <span class="verse" rel="v001023018" id="023018" >18</span>
 to Abraam for a possession, before the sons of Chet, and all that entered into the city.  
<!-- 023 018 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001023019" id="023019" >19</span>
 After this Abraam buried Sarrha his wife in the Double Cave of the field, which is opposite Mambre, this is Chebron in the land of Chanaan.  <span class="verse" rel="v001023020" id="023020" >20</span>
 So the field and the cave which was in it were made sure to Abraam for possession of a burying place, by the sons of Chet.  <p>

 And Abraam said to him, Take heed to yourself that you carry not my son back there.  <span class="verse" rel="v001024007" id="024007" >7</span>
 The Lord the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, who took me out of my father's house, and out of the land whence I sprang, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, I will give this land to you and to your seed, he shall send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife to my son from thence.  <span class="verse" rel="v001024008" id="024008" >8</span>

 and she said, Drink, Sir; and she hasted, and let down the pitcher upon her arm, and gave him to drink, till he ceased drinking.  <span class="verse" rel="v001024019" id="024019" >19</span>
 And she said, I will also draw water for your camels, till they shall all have drunk.  <span class="verse" rel="v001024020" id="024020" >20</span>
 And she hasted, and emptied the water-pot into the trough, and ran to the well to draw again, and drew water for all the camels.  <span class="verse" rel="v001024021" id="024021" >21</span>

 But you shall go to the house of my father, and to my tribe, and you shall take thence a wife for my son.  <span class="verse" rel="v001024039" id="024039" >39</span>
 And I said to my master, Haply the woman will not go with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v001024040" id="024040" >40</span>
 And he said to me, The Lord God to whom I have been acceptable in his presence, himself shall send out his angel with you, and shall prosper your journey, and you shall take a wife for my son of my tribe, and of the house of my father.  <span class="verse" rel="v001024041" id="024041" >41</span>
 Then shall you be clear from my curse, for whenever you shall have come to my tribe, and they shall not give her to you, then shall you be clear from my oath.  <span class="verse" rel="v001024042" id="024042" >42</span>

 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter are you? tell me; and she said, I am daughter of Bathuel the son of Nachor, whom Melcha bore to him; and I put on her the ear-rings, and the bracelets on her hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v001024048" id="024048" >48</span>
 And being well-pleased I worshipped the Lord, and I blessed the Lord the God of my master Abraam, who has prospered me in a true way, so that I should take the daughter of my master's brother for his son.  <span class="verse" rel="v001024049" id="024049" >49</span>
 If then you°   will   deal mercifully and justly with my lord,   tell me  , and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.

 And it came to pass when the servant of Abraam heard these words, he bowed himself to the Lord down to the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v001024053" id="024053" >53</span>
 And the servant having brought forth jewels of silver and gold and raiment, gave them to Rebecca, and gave gifts to her brother, and to her mother.  <span class="verse" rel="v001024054" id="024054" >54</span>

 And her brethren and her mother said, Let the virgin remain with us about ten days, and after that she shall depart.  <span class="verse" rel="v001024056" id="024056" >56</span>
 But he said to them, Hinder me not, for the Lord has prospered my journey for me; send me away, that I may depart to my master.  <span class="verse" rel="v001024057" id="024057" >57</span>
 And they said, Let us call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v001024058" id="024058" >58</span>

 And Isaac went forth into the plain toward evening to meditate; and having lifted up his eyes, he saw camels coming.  <span class="verse" rel="v001024064" id="024064" >64</span>
 And Rebecca lifted up her eyes, and saw Isaac; and she alighted briskly from the camel,  <span class="verse" rel="v001024065" id="024065" >65</span>
 and said to the servant, Who is that man that walks in the plain to meet us? And the servant said, This is my master; and she took her veil and covered herself.

 And the babes leaped within her; and she said, If it will be so with me, why is this to me? And she went to enquire of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v001025023" id="025023" >23</span>
 And the Lord said to her,

 And the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered, and she had twins in her womb.  <span class="verse" rel="v001025025" id="025025" >25</span>
 And the first came out red, hairy all over like a skin; and she called his name Esau.  <span class="verse" rel="v001025026" id="025026" >26</span>
 And after this came forth his brother, and his hand took hold of the heel of Esau; and she called his name Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when Rebecca bore them.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001025027" id="025027" >27</span>
 And the lads grew, and Esau was a man skilled in hunting, dwelling in the country, and Jacob a simple man, dwelling in a house.  <span class="verse" rel="v001025028" id="025028" >28</span>

 And Jacob cooked pottage, and Esau came from the plain, fainting.  <span class="verse" rel="v001025030" id="025030" >30</span>
 And Esau said to Jacob, Let me taste of that red pottage, because I am fainting; therefore his name was called Edom.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001025031" id="025031" >31</span>
 And Jacob said to Esau, Sell me this day your birthright.  <span class="verse" rel="v001025032" id="025032" >32</span>
 And Esau said, Behold, I am going to die, and for what good does this birthright   belong   to me?  <span class="verse" rel="v001025033" id="025033" >33</span>
 And Jacob said to him, Swear to me this day; and he swore to him; and Esau sold his birthright to Jacob.

<p><span class="chapter" id="026001">26</span> And there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine, which was in the time of Abraam; and Isaac went to Abimelech the king of the Phylistines to Gerara.  <span class="verse" rel="v001026002" id="026002" >2</span>
 And the Lord appeared to him and said, Go not down to Egypt, but dwell in the land, which I shall tell you of.  <span class="verse" rel="v001026003" id="026003" >3</span>
 And sojourn in this land; and I will be with you, and bless you, for I will give to you and to your seed all this land; and I will establish my oath which I swore to your father Abraam.  <span class="verse" rel="v001026004" id="026004" >4</span>
 And I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven; and I will give to your seed all this land, and all the nations of the earth shall be blest in your seed.  <span class="verse" rel="v001026005" id="026005" >5</span>
 Because Abraam your father listened to my voice, and kept my injunctions, and my commandments, and my ordinances, and my statutes.  <span class="verse" rel="v001026006" id="026006" >6</span>
 And Isaac lived in Gerara.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001026007" id="026007" >7</span>
 And the men of the place questioned him concerning Rebecca his wife, and he said, She is my sister, for he feared to say, She is my wife, lest at any time the men of the place should kill him because of Rebecca, because she was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. fair of countenance.  </span>  fair.

 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said to him, Is she then your wife? why have you said, She is my sister? And Isaac said to him,   I did so  , for I said, Lest at any time I die on her account.  
<!-- 026 009 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001026010" id="026010" >10</span>
 And Abimelech said to him, Why have you done this to us? one of my kindred  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        q.d. had almost.  </span>  within a little had lain with your wife, and you would have brought   a sin of   ignorance upon us.  <span class="verse" rel="v001026011" id="026011" >11</span>
 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying Every man that touches this man and his wife shall be liable to death.  
<!-- 026 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001026012" id="026012" >12</span>
 And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found in that year barley and hundred-fold, and the Lord blessed him.  <span class="verse" rel="v001026013" id="026013" >13</span>
 And the man was exalted, and advancing he increased, till he became very great.  <span class="verse" rel="v001026014" id="026014" >14</span>
 And he had cattle of sheep, and cattle of oxen, and many tilled lands, and the Phylistines envied him.  <span class="verse" rel="v001026015" id="026015" >15</span>
 And all the wells which the servants of his father had dug in the time of his father, the Phylistines stopped them, and filled them with earth.  
<!-- 026 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001026016" id="026016" >16</span>
 And Abimelech said to Isaac, Depart from us, for you are become much mightier than we.  <span class="verse" rel="v001026017" id="026017" >17</span>
 And Isaac departed thence, and rested in the valley of Gerara, and lived there.  <span class="verse" rel="v001026018" id="026018" >18</span>
 And Isaac dug again the wells of water, which the servants of his father Abraam had dug, and the Phylistines had stopped them, after the death of his father Abraam; and he gave them names, according to the names by which his father named them.  
<!-- 026 018 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001026019" id="026019" >19</span>
 And the servants of Isaac dug in the valley of Gerara, and they found there a well of living water.  <span class="verse" rel="v001026020" id="026020" >20</span>
 And the shepherds of Gerara strove with the shepherds of Isaac, saying that the water was theirs; and they called the name of the well, Injury, for they injured him.  <span class="verse" rel="v001026021" id="026021" >21</span>
 And having departed thence he dug another well, and they strove also for that; and he named the name of it, Enmity.  <span class="verse" rel="v001026022" id="026022" >22</span>
 And he departed thence and dug another well; and they did not strive about that; and he named the name of it, Room, saying, Because now the Lord has made room for us, and has increased us upon the earth.  
<!-- 026 022 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001026023" id="026023" >23</span>
 And he went up thence to the well of the oath.  <span class="verse" rel="v001026024" id="026024" >24</span>
 And the Lord appeared to him in that night, and said, I am the God of Abraam your father; fear not, for I am with you, and I will bless you, and multiply your seed for the sake of Abraam your father.  <span class="verse" rel="v001026025" id="026025" >25</span>
 And he built there an altar, and called on the name of the Lord, and there he pitched his tent, and there the servants of Isaac dug a well in the valley of Gerara.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001026026" id="026026" >26</span>

 And Isaac said to them, Therefore have you° come to me? whereas you° hated me, and sent me away from you.  <span class="verse" rel="v001026028" id="026028" >28</span>
 And they said, We have surely seen that the Lord was with you, and we said, Let there be an oath between us and you, and we will make a covenant with you,  <span class="verse" rel="v001026029" id="026029" >29</span>
 that you shall do no wrong by us, as we have not abhorred you, and according as we have treated you well, and have sent you forth peaceably; and now you are blessed of the Lord.

 And he made a feast for them, and they ate and drank.  <span class="verse" rel="v001026031" id="026031" >31</span>
 And they arose in the morning, and swore each to his neighbor; and Isaac sent them forth, and they departed from him in safety.  
<!-- 026 031 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001026032" id="026032" >32</span>
 And it came to pass in that day, that the servants of Isaac came and told him of the well which they had dug; and they said, We have not found water.  <span class="verse" rel="v001026033" id="026033" >33</span>
 And he called it, Oath: therefore he called the name of that city, the Well of Oath, until this day.

 And he said, Behold, I am grown old, and know not the day of my death.  <span class="verse" rel="v001027003" id="027003" >3</span>
 Now then take the weapons, both your quiver and your bow, and go into the plain, and get me venison,  <span class="verse" rel="v001027004" id="027004" >4</span>

 And Rebecca heard Isaac speaking to Esau his son; and Esau went to the plain to procure venison for his father.  <span class="verse" rel="v001027006" id="027006" >6</span>
 And Rebecca said to Jacob her younger son, Behold, I heard your father speaking to Esau your brother, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v001027007" id="027007" >7</span>
 Bring me venison, and prepare me meats, that I may eat and bless you before the Lord before I die.  <span class="verse" rel="v001027008" id="027008" >8</span>
 Now then, my son, listen to me, as I command you.  <span class="verse" rel="v001027009" id="027009" >9</span>

 And Jacob said to his mother Rebecca, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I a smooth man.  <span class="verse" rel="v001027012" id="027012" >12</span>
 Peradventure my father may feel me, and I shall be before him as one ill-intentioned, and I shall bring upon me a curse, and not a blessing.  <span class="verse" rel="v001027013" id="027013" >13</span>

 And Jacob drew near to his father Isaac, and he felt him, and said, The voice   is   Jacob's voice, but the hands   are   the hands of Esau.  <span class="verse" rel="v001027023" id="027023" >23</span>
 And he knew him not, for his hands were as the hands of his brother Esau, hairy; and he blessed him,  <span class="verse" rel="v001027024" id="027024" >24</span>
 and he said, Are you my son Esau? and he said, I   am  .  <span class="verse" rel="v001027025" id="027025" >25</span>

 and dreamed, and behold a ladder fixed on the earth, whose top reached to heaven, and the angels of God ascended and descended on it.  <span class="verse" rel="v001028013" id="028013" >13</span>
 And the Lord  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. was established.  </span>  stood upon it, and said, I am the God of your father Abraam, and the God of Isaac; fear not, the land on which you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed.  <span class="verse" rel="v001028014" id="028014" >14</span>

 And behold I am with you to preserve you continually in all the way wherein you shall go; and I will bring you back to this land; for I will not desert you, until I have done all that I have said to you.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001028016" id="028016" >16</span>
 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and said, The Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.  <span class="verse" rel="v001028017" id="028017" >17</span>
 And he was afraid, and said, How fearful is this place! this is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001028018" id="028018" >18</span>

 And he called the name of that place, the House of God; and the name of the city before was Ulam-luz.  <span class="verse" rel="v001028020" id="028020" >20</span>
 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If the Lord God will be with me, and guard me throughout on this journey, on which I am going, and give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,  <span class="verse" rel="v001028021" id="028021" >21</span>

 And he looks, and behold! a well in the plain; and there were there three flocks of sheep resting at it, for out of that well they watered the flocks, but there was a great stone at the mouth of the well.  <span class="verse" rel="v001029003" id="029003" >3</span>
 And there were all the flocks gathered, and they used to roll away the stone from the mouth of the well, and water the flocks, and set the stone again in its place on the mouth of the well.

 And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, He is well. And behold Rachel his daughter came with the sheep.  <span class="verse" rel="v001029007" id="029007" >7</span>
 And Jacob said, it is yet high day, it is not yet time that the flocks be gathered together; water you° the flocks, and depart and feed them.  <span class="verse" rel="v001029008" id="029008" >8</span>
 And they said, We shall not be able, until all the shepherds be gathered together, and they shall roll away the stone from the mouth of the well, then we will water the flocks.

 And it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother, that Jacob came and rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother.  <span class="verse" rel="v001029011" id="029011" >11</span>
 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and cried with a loud voice and wept.  <span class="verse" rel="v001029012" id="029012" >12</span>
 And he told Rachel that he was the near relative of her father, and the son of Rebecca; and she ran and reported to her father according to these words.  <span class="verse" rel="v001029013" id="029013" >13</span>
 And it came to pass when Laban heard the name of Jacob, his sister's son, he ran to meet him, and embraced and kissed him, and brought him into his house; and he told Laban all these sayings.  <span class="verse" rel="v001029014" id="029014" >14</span>
 And Laban said to him, You are of my bones and of my flesh; and he was with him a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. month of days.  </span>  full month.

 Now Laban had two daughters, the name of the elder was Lea, and the name of the younger, Rachel.  <span class="verse" rel="v001029017" id="029017" >17</span>
 And the eyes of Lea were weak. But Rachel was beautiful in appearance, and exceedingly fair in countenance.  <span class="verse" rel="v001029018" id="029018" >18</span>
 And Jacob loved Rachel, and said, I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.  <span class="verse" rel="v001029019" id="029019" >19</span>
 And Laban said to him,   It is   better that I should give her to you, than that I should give her to another man; dwell with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v001029020" id="029020" >20</span>
 And Jacob served for Rachel seven years, and they were before him as a few days, by reason of his loving her.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001029021" id="029021" >21</span>
 And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v001029022" id="029022" >22</span>
 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a marriage-feast.  <span class="verse" rel="v001029023" id="029023" >23</span>
 And it was even, and he took his daughter Lea, and brought her in to Jacob, and Jacob went in to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v001029024" id="029024" >24</span>
 And Laban gave to his daughter Lea, Zelpha his handmaid, as a handmaid for her.  
<!-- 029 024 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001029025" id="029025" >25</span>
 And it was morning, and behold it was Lea; and Jacob said to Laban, What is this that you have done to me? did I not serve you for Rachel? and therefore have you deceived me?  <span class="verse" rel="v001029026" id="029026" >26</span>
 And Laban answered, It is not done thus in our country, to give the younger before the elder.  <span class="verse" rel="v001029027" id="029027" >27</span>
 Fulfil then her sevens, and I will give to you her also in return for your labor, which you labor with me, yet seven other years.

 And when the Lord God saw that Lea was hated, he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.  <span class="verse" rel="v001029032" id="029032" >32</span>
 And Lea conceived and bore a son to Jacob; and she called his name, Ruben; saying, Because the Lord has looked on my humiliation, and has given me a son, now then my husband will love me.

 And he laid the rods which he had peeled, in the hollows of the watering-troughs, that whenever the cattle should come to drink, as they should have come to drink before the rods, the cattle might conceive at the rods.  <span class="verse" rel="v001030039" id="030039" >39</span>

 And it came to pass in the time wherein the cattle became pregnant, conceiving in the belly, Jacob put the rods before the cattle in the troughs, that they might conceive by the rods.  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The meaning of the Hebrew seems to be, when the cattle were weak from any cause.

<!-- 031 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001031014" id="031014" >14</span>
 And Rachel and Lea answered and said to him, Have we yet a part or inheritance in the house of our father?  <span class="verse" rel="v001031015" id="031015" >15</span>
 Are we not considered strangers by him? for he has sold us, and quite devoured our money.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031016" id="031016" >16</span>
 All the wealth and the glory which God has taken from our father, it shall be our's and our children's; now then do whatever God has said to you.  
<!-- 031 016 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001031017" id="031017" >17</span>
 And Jacob arose and took his wives and his children up on the camels;  <span class="verse" rel="v001031018" id="031018" >18</span>
 and he took away all his possessions and all his store, which he had gotten in Mesopotamia, and all that belonged to him, to depart to Isaac his father in the land of Chanaan.  
<!-- 031 018 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001031019" id="031019" >19</span>
 And Laban went to shear his sheep; and Rachel stole her father's images.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031020" id="031020" >20</span>
 And Jacob hid   the matter from   Laban the Syrian, so as not to tell him that he ran away.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031021" id="031021" >21</span>
 And he departed himself and all that belonged to him, and passed over the river, and went into the mountain Galaad.  
<!-- 031 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001031022" id="031022" >22</span>
 But it was told Laban the Syrian on the third day, that Jacob was fled.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031023" id="031023" >23</span>
 And having taken his brethren with him, he pursued after him seven days' journey, and overtook him on Mount Galaad.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031024" id="031024" >24</span>
 And God came to Laban the Syrian in sleep by night, and said to him, Take heed to yourself that you speak not at any time to Jacob evil things.  
<!-- 031 024 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001031025" id="031025" >25</span>
 And Laban overtook Jacob; and Jacob pitched his tent in the mountain; and Laban stationed his brothers in the mount Galaad.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031026" id="031026" >26</span>
 And Laban said to Jacob, What have you done? therefore did you run away secretly, and pillage me, and lead away my daughters as captives taken with the sword?  <span class="verse" rel="v001031027" id="031027" >27</span>
 Whereas if you had told me, I would have sent you away with mirth, and with songs, and timbrels, and harp.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031028" id="031028" >28</span>
 And I was not counted worthy to embrace my children and my daughters; now then you have wrought foolishly.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031029" id="031029" >29</span>
 And now my hand has power to hurt you; but the God of your father spoke to me yesterday, saying, Take heed to yourself that you speak not evil words to Jacob.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031030" id="031030" >30</span>
 Now then go on your way, for you have earnestly desired to depart to the house of your father; therefore have you stolen my gods?  
<!-- 031 030 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001031031" id="031031" >31</span>
 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid; for I said, Lest at any time you should take away your daughters from me, and all my possessions.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031032" id="031032" >32</span>
 And Jacob said, With whoever you shall find your gods, he shall not live in the presence of our brethren; take notice of what I have of your property, and take it; and he observed nothing with him, but Jacob knew not that his wife Rachel had stolen them.  
<!-- 031 032 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001031033" id="031033" >33</span>
 And Laban went in and searched in the house of Lea, and found   them   not; and he went out of the house of Lea, and searched in the house of Jacob, and in the house of the two maidservants, and found them not; and he went also into the house of Rachel.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031034" id="031034" >34</span>
 And Rachel took the idols, and cast them among the camel's packs, and sat upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031035" id="031035" >35</span>
 And she said to her father, Be not indignant, Sir; I can’t rise up before you, for it is with me according to the manner of women. Laban searched in all the house, and found not the images.  
<!-- 031 035 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001031036" id="031036" >36</span>
 And Jacob was angry, and strove with Laban; and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my injustice, and what my sin, that you have pursued after me,  <span class="verse" rel="v001031037" id="031037" >37</span>
 and that you have searched all the furniture of my house? what have you found of all the furniture of your house? set it here between your relations and my relations, and let them decide between us two.  
<!-- 031 037 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001031038" id="031038" >38</span>
 These twenty years have I been with you; your sheep, and your she-goats have not failed in bearing; I devoured not the rams of your cattle.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031039" id="031039" >39</span>
 That which was taken of beasts I brought not to you; I made good of myself the thefts of the day, and the thefts of the night.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031040" id="031040" >40</span>
 I was parched with heat by day, and   chilled   with frost by night, and my sleep departed from my eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031041" id="031041" >41</span>
 These twenty years have I been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years among your sheep, and you did falsely rate my wages for ten lambs.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031042" id="031042" >42</span>
 Unless I had the God of my father Abraam, and the fear of Isaac, now you would have sent me away empty; God saw my humiliation, and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you yesterday.  
<!-- 031 042 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001031043" id="031043" >43</span>
 And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the sons my sons, and the cattle are my cattle, and all things which you see are mine, and   the property   of my daughters; what shall I do to them today, or their children which they bore?  <span class="verse" rel="v001031044" id="031044" >44</span>
 Now then come, let me make a covenant, both I and you, and it shall be for a witness between me and you; and he said to him, Behold, there is no one with us; behold, God is witness between me and you.  
<!-- 031 044 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001031045" id="031045" >45</span>
 And Jacob having taken a stone, set it up for a pillar.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031046" id="031046" >46</span>
 And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones; and they gathered stones and made a heap, and ate there upon the heap; and Laban said to him, This heap witnesses between me and you today.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031047" id="031047" >47</span>
 And Laban called it, the Heap of Testimony; and Jacob called it, the Witness Heap.  
<!-- 031 047 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001031048" id="031048" >48</span>
 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and the pillar, which I have set between me and you; this heap witnesses, and this pillar witnesses; therefore its name was called, the Heap witnesses.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031049" id="031049" >49</span>
 And the vision of which he said—Let God look to it between me and you, because we are about to depart from each other, —  <span class="verse" rel="v001031050" id="031050" >50</span>
 If you shall humble my daughters, if you should take wives in addition to my daughters, see, there is no one with us looking on. God   is   witness between me and you.  
<!-- 031 050 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001031051" id="031051" >51</span>
 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold, this heap, and this pillar are a witness.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031052" id="031052" >52</span>
 For if I should not cross over to you, neither should you cross over to me, for mischief beyond this heap and this pillar.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031053" id="031053" >53</span>
 The God of Abraam and the God of Nachor judge between us; and Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.  <span class="verse" rel="v001031054" id="031054" >54</span>
 And he offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren, and they ate and drank, and slept in the mountain. <p>
<!-- 032 054 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="032001">32</span> And Laban rose up in the morning, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them; and Laban having turned back, departed to his place.  
<!-- 032 001 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001032002" id="032002" >2</span>
 And Jacob departed for his journey; and having looked up, he saw the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. camp  </span>  host of God encamped; and the angels of God met him.  
<!-- 032 002 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001032003" id="032003" >3</span>
 And Jacob said, when he saw them, This is the Camp of God; and he called the name of that place, Encampments.  <span class="verse" rel="v001032004" id="032004" >4</span>
 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, to the country of Edom.  <span class="verse" rel="v001032005" id="032005" >5</span>
 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall you° say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob; I have sojourned with Laban and tarried until now.  
<!-- 032 005 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001032006" id="032006" >6</span>
 And there were born to me oxen, and asses, and sheep, and menservants and women-servants; and I sent to tell my lord Esau, that your servant might find grace in your sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v001032007" id="032007" >7</span>
 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and behold! he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v001032008" id="032008" >8</span>
 And Jacob was greatly terrified, and was perplexed; and he divided the people that was with him, and the cows, and the camels, and the sheep, into two camps.  
<!-- 032 008 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001032009" id="032009" >9</span>
 And Jacob said, If Esau should come to one camp, and strike it, the other camp shall be in safety.  <span class="verse" rel="v001032010" id="032010" >10</span>
 And Jacob said, God of my father Abraam, and God of my father Isaac, O Lord, you   are   he that said to me, Depart quickly to the land of your birth, and I will do you good.  <span class="verse" rel="v001032011" id="032011" >11</span>
 Let there be to me a sufficiency of all the justice and all the truth which you have wrought with your servant; for with this my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two camps.  <span class="verse" rel="v001032012" id="032012" >12</span>
 Deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I am afraid of him, lest haply he should come and strike me, and the mother upon the children.  
<!-- 032 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001032013" id="032013" >13</span>
 But you said, I will do you good, and will make your seed as the sand of the sea, which shall not be numbered for multitude.  <span class="verse" rel="v001032014" id="032014" >14</span>
 And he slept there that night, and took of the gifts which he carried   with him  , and sent out to Esau his brother,  <span class="verse" rel="v001032015" id="032015" >15</span>
 two hundred she-goats, twenty he-goats, two hundred sheep, twenty rams,  <span class="verse" rel="v001032016" id="032016" >16</span>
 milch camels, and their foals, thirty, forty kine, ten bulls, twenty asses, and ten colts.  <span class="verse" rel="v001032017" id="032017" >17</span>
 And he gave them to his servants   each   drove apart; and he said to his servants, Go on before me, and put a space between drove and drove.  <span class="verse" rel="v001032018" id="032018" >18</span>
 And he charged the first, saying, If Esau my brother meet you, and he ask you, saying, Whose are you? and whither would you go, and whose are these possessions advancing before you?  
<!-- 032 018 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001032019" id="032019" >19</span>
 You shall say, Your servant Jacob's; he has sent gifts to my lord Esau, and behold! he is behind us.  <span class="verse" rel="v001032020" id="032020" >20</span>
 And he charged the first and the second and the third, and all that went before him after these flocks, saying, Thus shall you° speak to Esau when you° find him;  <span class="verse" rel="v001032021" id="032021" >21</span>
 and you° shall say, Behold your servant Jacob comes after us.

<!-- 032 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001032022" id="032022" >22</span>
 So the presents went on before him, but he himself lodged that night in the camp.  <span class="verse" rel="v001032023" id="032023" >23</span>
 And he rose up in that night, and took his two wives and his two servant-maids, and his eleven children, and crossed over the ford of Jaboch.  <span class="verse" rel="v001032024" id="032024" >24</span>
 And he took them, and passed over the torrent, and brought over all his possessions.  <span class="verse" rel="v001032025" id="032025" >25</span>
 And Jacob was left alone; and a man wrestled with him till the morning.  
<!-- 032 025 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001032026" id="032026" >26</span>
 And he saw that he prevailed not against him; and he touched the broad part of his thigh, and the broad part of Jacob's thigh was benumbed in his wrestling with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v001032027" id="032027" >27</span>
 And he said to him, Let me go, for the day has dawned; but he said, I will not let you go, except you bless me.  <span class="verse" rel="v001032028" id="032028" >28</span>
 And he said to him, What is your name? and he answered, Jacob.  
<!-- 032 028 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001032029" id="032029" >29</span>
 And he said to him, Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name; for you have prevailed with God, and shall be mighty with men.  <span class="verse" rel="v001032030" id="032030" >30</span>
 And Jacob asked and said, Tell me your name; and he said, Therefore do you ask after my name? and he blessed him there.  
<!-- 032 030 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001032031" id="032031" >31</span>
 And Jacob called the name of that place, the Face of God; for,   said he,   I have seen God face to face, and my life was preserved.  <span class="verse" rel="v001032032" id="032032" >32</span>
 And the sun rose upon him, when he passed the Face of God; and he halted upon his thigh.  <span class="verse" rel="v001032033" id="032033" >33</span>
 Therefore the children of Israel will by no means eat of the sinew which was benumbed, which is on the broad part of the thigh, until this day, because   the angel   touched the broad part of the thigh of Jacob—  even   the sinew which was benumbed.  <p>

 But he advanced himself before them, and did reverence to the ground seven times, until he drew near to his brother.  <span class="verse" rel="v001033004" id="033004" >4</span>
 And Esau ran on to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him; and they both wept.  <span class="verse" rel="v001033005" id="033005" >5</span>
 And Esau looked up and saw the women and the children, and said, What are these to you? And he said, The children with which God has mercifully blessed your servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v001033006" id="033006" >6</span>

 And Esau said, I have much, my brother; keep your own.  <span class="verse" rel="v001033010" id="033010" >10</span>
 And Jacob said, If I have found grace in your sight, receive the gifts through my hands; therefore have I seen your face, as if any one should see the face of God, and you shall be well-pleased with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v001033011" id="033011" >11</span>
 Receive my blessings, which I have brought you, because God has had mercy on me, and I have all things; and he constrained him, and he took   them  .

 And he said, Let us depart, and proceed right onward.  <span class="verse" rel="v001033013" id="033013" >13</span>
 And he said to him, My lord knows, that the children are very tender, and the flocks and the herds with me are with young; if then I shall drive them hard one day, all the cattle will die.  <span class="verse" rel="v001033014" id="033014" >14</span>

 And Jacob departs to his tents; and he made for himself there habitations, and for his cattle he made booths; therefore he called the name of that place, Booths.

 And his father rebuked him, and said to him, What is this dream which you have dreamed? shall indeed both I and your mother and your brethren come and bow before you to the earth?  <span class="verse" rel="v001037011" id="037011" >11</span>

 And he said, I am seeking my brethren; tell me where they feed   their flocks  .  <span class="verse" rel="v001037017" id="037017" >17</span>
 And the man said to him, They have departed hence, for I heard them saying, Let us go to Dothaim; and Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothaim.

 And they spied him from a distance before he drew near to them, and they wickedly took counsel to kill him.  <span class="verse" rel="v001037019" id="037019" >19</span>
 And each said to his brother, Behold, that dreamer comes.  <span class="verse" rel="v001037020" id="037020" >20</span>
 Now then come, let us kill him, and cast him into one of the pits; and we will say, An evil wild beast has devoured him; and we shall see what his dreams will be.

 And Judas said to his brethren, What profit is it if we kill our brother, and conceal his blood?  <span class="verse" rel="v001037027" id="037027" >27</span>
 Come, let us sell him to these Ismaelites, but let not our hands be upon him, because he is our brother and our flesh; and his brethren listened.  <span class="verse" rel="v001037028" id="037028" >28</span>

 And having taken the coat of Joseph, they killed a kid of the goats, and stained the coat with the blood.  <span class="verse" rel="v001037032" id="037032" >32</span>
 And they sent the coat of many colors; and they brought it to their father, and said, This have we found; know if it be your son's coat or no. And he recognized it, and said, It is my son's coat, an evil wild beast has devoured him; a wild beast has carried off Joseph.

<p><span class="chapter" id="038001">38</span> And it came to pass at that time that Judas went down from his brethren, and came as far as to a certain man of Odollam, whose name was Iras.  <span class="verse" rel="v001038002" id="038002" >2</span>
 And Judas saw there the daughter of a Chananitish man, whose name was Sava; and he took her, and went in to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v001038003" id="038003" >3</span>
 And she conceived and bore a son, and called his name, Er.  <span class="verse" rel="v001038004" id="038004" >4</span>
 And she conceived and bore a son again; and called his name, Aunan.  <span class="verse" rel="v001038005" id="038005" >5</span>

 And Er, the firstborn of Judas, was wicked before the Lord; and God killed him.  
<!-- 038 007 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001038008" id="038008" >8</span>
 And Judas said to Aunan, Go in to your brother's wife, and marry her as her brother-in-law, and raise up seed to your brother.  <span class="verse" rel="v001038009" id="038009" >9</span>
 And Aunan, knowing that the seed should not be his—it came to pass when he went in to his brother's wife, that he spilled   it   upon the ground, so that he should not give seed to his brother's wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v001038010" id="038010" >10</span>
 And his doing this appeared evil before God; and he killed him also.  
<!-- 038 010 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001038011" id="038011" >11</span>
 And Judas said to Thamar, his daughter-in-law, Sit you a widow in the house of your father-in-law, until Selom my son be grown; for he said, lest he also die as his brethren; and Thamar departed, and sat in the house of her father.  
<!-- 038 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001038012" id="038012" >12</span>
 And the days were fulfilled, and Sava the wife of Judas died; and Judas, being comforted, went to them that sheared his sheep, himself and Iras his Shepherd the Odollamite, to Thamna.  <span class="verse" rel="v001038013" id="038013" >13</span>
 And it was told Thamar his daughter-in-law, saying, Behold, your father-in-law goes up to Thamna, to shear his sheep.  <span class="verse" rel="v001038014" id="038014" >14</span>
 And having taken off the garments of her widowhood from her, she put on a veil, and ornamented her face, and sat by the gates of Aenan, which is in the way to Thamna, for she saw that Selom was grown; but he gave her not to him for a wife.  
<!-- 038 014 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001038015" id="038015" >15</span>
 And when Judas saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; for she covered her face, and he knew her not.  <span class="verse" rel="v001038016" id="038016" >16</span>
 And he went out of his way to her, and said to her, Let me come in to you; for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law; and she said, What will you give me if you should come in to me?  <span class="verse" rel="v001038017" id="038017" >17</span>
 And he said, I will send you a kid of the goats from my flock; and she said,   Well  , if you will give me an earnest, until you send it.  <span class="verse" rel="v001038018" id="038018" >18</span>
 And he said, What is the earnest that I shall give you? and she said, Your ring, and your bracelet, and the staff in your hand; and he gave them to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him.  <span class="verse" rel="v001038019" id="038019" >19</span>
 And she arose and departed, and took her veil from off her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.  
<!-- 038 019 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001038020" id="038020" >20</span>
 And Judas sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his shepherd the Odollamite, to receive the pledge from the woman; and he found her not.  <span class="verse" rel="v001038021" id="038021" >21</span>
 And he asked the men of the place, Where is the harlot who was in Aenan by the wayside? and they said, There was no harlot here.  <span class="verse" rel="v001038022" id="038022" >22</span>
 And he returned to Judas, and said, I have not found her; and the men of the place say, There is no harlot here.  <span class="verse" rel="v001038023" id="038023" >23</span>
 And Judas said, Let her have them, but let us not be ridiculed; I sent this kid, but you have not found her.  
<!-- 038 023 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001038024" id="038024" >24</span>
 And it came to pass after three months, that it was told Judas, saying, Thamar your daughter-in-law has grievously played the harlot, and behold she is with child by whoredom; and Judas said, Bring her out, and let her be burnt.  <span class="verse" rel="v001038025" id="038025" >25</span>
 And as they were bringing her, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, I am with child by the man whose these things are; and she said, See whose is this ring and bracelet and staff.  <span class="verse" rel="v001038026" id="038026" >26</span>
 And Judas knew   them  , and said, Thamar is cleared rather than I, forasmuch as I gave her not to Selom my son: and he knew her not again.  
<!-- 038 026 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001038027" id="038027" >27</span>
 And it came to pass when she was in labor, that she also had twins in her womb.  <span class="verse" rel="v001038028" id="038028" >28</span>
 And it came to pass as she was bringing forth, one thrust forth his hand, and the midwife having taken hold of it, bound upon his hand a scarlet   thread  , saying, This one shall come out first.  <span class="verse" rel="v001038029" id="038029" >29</span>
 And when he drew back his hand, then immediately came forth his brother; and she said, Why has the barrier been cut through because of you? and she called his name, Phares.  <span class="verse" rel="v001038030" id="038030" >30</span>
 And after this came forth his brother, on whose hand was the scarlet thread; and she called his name, Zara.  <p>

 And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house with his lord the Egyptian.  <span class="verse" rel="v001039003" id="039003" >3</span>
 And his master knew that the Lord was with him, and the Lord prospers in his hands whatever he happens to do.  <span class="verse" rel="v001039004" id="039004" >4</span>
 And Joseph found grace in the presence of his lord, and was well-pleasing to him; and he set him over his house, and all that he had he gave into the hand of Joseph.  <span class="verse" rel="v001039005" id="039005" >5</span>
 And it came to pass after that he was set over his house, and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the Lord was on all his possessions in the house, and in his field.  <span class="verse" rel="v001039006" id="039006" >6</span>
 And he committed all that he had into the hands of Joseph; and he knew not of anything that belonged to him, save the bread which he himself ate.

<p> And Joseph was handsome in form, and exceedingly beautiful in countenance.  <span class="verse" rel="v001039007" id="039007" >7</span>
 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, and said, Lie with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v001039008" id="039008" >8</span>
 But he would not; but said to his master's wife, If because of me my master knows nothing in his house, and has given into my hands all things that belong to him:  <span class="verse" rel="v001039009" id="039009" >9</span>

 And when she talked with Joseph day by day, and he listened not to her to sleep with her, so as to be with her,

 Joseph went in to them in the morning, and saw them, and they had been troubled.  <span class="verse" rel="v001040007" id="040007" >7</span>

 And they said to him, We have seen a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, Is not the interpretation of them through god? tell   them   than to me.  
<!-- 040 008 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001040009" id="040009" >9</span>
 And the chief cupbearer related his dream to Joseph, and said, In my  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. sleep.  </span>  dream a vine was before me.  <span class="verse" rel="v001040010" id="040010" >10</span>
 And in the vine   were   three stems; and it budding shot forth blossoms; the clusters of grapes were ripe.  <span class="verse" rel="v001040011" id="040011" >11</span>
 And the cup of Pharao was in my hand; and I took the bunch of grapes, and squeezed it into the cup, and gave the cup into Pharao's hand.  
<!-- 040 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001040012" id="040012" >12</span>
 And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it. The three stems are three days.  <span class="verse" rel="v001040013" id="040013" >13</span>
 Yet three days and Pharao shall remember your office, and he shall restore you to your place of chief cupbearer, and you shall give the cup of Pharao into his hand, according to your former high place, as you were wont to be cupbearer.  <span class="verse" rel="v001040014" id="040014" >14</span>
 But remember me of yourself, when it shall be well with you, and you shall deal mercifully with me, and you shall make mention of me to Pharao, and you shall bring me forth out of this dungeon.  <span class="verse" rel="v001040015" id="040015" >15</span>
 For surely I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here I have done nothing, but they have cast me into this pit.  
<!-- 040 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001040016" id="040016" >16</span>
 And the chief baker saw that he interpreted aright; and he said to Joseph, I also saw a dream, and I thought I took up on my head three baskets of mealy food.  <span class="verse" rel="v001040017" id="040017" >17</span>
 And in the upper basket there was the work of the baker of every kind which Pharao eats; and the fowls of the air ate them out of the basket that was on my head.  
<!-- 040 017 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001040018" id="040018" >18</span>
 And Joseph answered and said to him, This is the interpretation of it; The three baskets are three days.  <span class="verse" rel="v001040019" id="040019" >19</span>
 Yet three days, and Pharao shall take away your head from off you, and shall hang you on a tree, and the birds of the sky shall eat your flesh from off you.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001040020" id="040020" >20</span>
 And it came to pass on the third day that it was Pharao's birth-day, and he made a banquet for all his servants, and he remembered the office of the cupbearer and the office of the baker in the midst of his servants.  <span class="verse" rel="v001040021" id="040021" >21</span>
 And he restored the chief cupbearer to his office, and he gave the cup into Pharao's hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v001040022" id="040022" >22</span>
 And he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph, interpreted to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v001040023" id="040023" >23</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="041001">41</span> And it came to pass after two  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. years of days.  </span>  full years that Pharao had a dream. He thought he stood upon   the bank of   the river.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041002" id="041002" >2</span>
 And behold, there came up as it were out of the river seven cows, fair in appearance, and choice of flesh, and they fed on the sedge.  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The Hebrew word which the LXX. have here written in Greek characters without translating it, is rendered in the place A.V. by meadow, in Job 8.11, the only other passage where it occurs, by flag.  </span>   <span class="verse" rel="v001041003" id="041003" >3</span>
 And other seven cows came up after these out of the river, ill-favoured and lean-fleshed, and fed by the   other   cows on the bank of the river.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041004" id="041004" >4</span>
 And the seven ill-favoured and lean cows devoured the seven well-favoured and choice-fleshed cows; and Pharao awoke.  
<!-- 041 004 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001041005" id="041005" >5</span>
 And he dreamed again. And, behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, choice and good.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041006" id="041006" >6</span>
 And, behold, seven ears thin and blasted with the wind, grew up after them.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041007" id="041007" >7</span>
 And the seven thin ears and blasted with the wind devoured the seven choice and full ears; and Pharao awoke, and it was a dream.  
<!-- 041 007 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001041008" id="041008" >8</span>
 And it was morning, and his soul was troubled; and he sent and called all the interpreters of Egypt, and all her wise men; and Pharao related to them his dream, and there was no one to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, tell.  </span>  interpret it to Pharao.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041009" id="041009" >9</span>
 And the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharao, saying, I this day remember my fault:  <span class="verse" rel="v001041010" id="041010" >10</span>
 Pharao was angry with his servants, and put us in prison in the house of the captain of the guard, both me and the chief baker.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041011" id="041011" >11</span>
 And we  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. saw.  </span>  had a dream both in one night, I and he; we saw, each according to his dream.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041012" id="041012" >12</span>
 And there was there with us a young man, a Hebrew servant of the captain of the guard; and we related to him   our dreams  , and he interpreted   them   to us.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041013" id="041013" >13</span>
 And it came to pass, as he interpreted them to us, so also it happened, both that I was restored to my office, and that he was hanged.  
<!-- 041 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001041014" id="041014" >14</span>
 And Pharao having sent, called Joseph; and they brought him out from the prison, and shaved him, and changed his dress, and he came to Pharao.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041015" id="041015" >15</span>
 And Pharao said to Joseph, I have seen a vision, and there is no one to interpret it; but I have heard  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. men saying.  </span>  say concerning you that you did hear dreams and interpret them.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041016" id="041016" >16</span>
 And Joseph answered Pharao and said, Without God an answer of safety shall not be given to Pharao.  
<!-- 041 016 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001041017" id="041017" >17</span>
 And Pharao spoke to Joseph, saying, In my dream I thought I stood by the bank of the river;  <span class="verse" rel="v001041018" id="041018" >18</span>
 and there came up as it were out of the river, seven cows well-favoured and choice-fleshed, and they fed on the sedge.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041019" id="041019" >19</span>
 And behold seven other cows came up after them out of the river, evil and ill-favoured and lean-fleshed, such that I never saw worse in all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041020" id="041020" >20</span>
 And the seven ill-favoured and thin cows ate up the seven first good and choice cows.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041021" id="041021" >21</span>
 And they went into their bellies; and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. they were.  </span>  it was not perceptible that they had gone into their bellies, and their appearance was ill-favoured, as also at the beginning; and after I awoke I slept,  <span class="verse" rel="v001041022" id="041022" >22</span>
 and saw again in my sleep, and as it were seven ears came up on one stem, full and good.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041023" id="041023" >23</span>
 And other seven ears, thin and blasted with the wind, sprang up close to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041024" id="041024" >24</span>
 And the seven thin and blasted ears devoured the seven fine and full ears: so I spoke to the interpreters, and there was no one to explain it to me.  
<!-- 041 024 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001041025" id="041025" >25</span>
 And Joseph said to Pharao, The dream of Pharao is one; whatever God does, he has shown to Pharao.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041026" id="041026" >26</span>
 The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream of Pharao is one.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041027" id="041027" >27</span>
 And the seven thin kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven thin and blasted ears are seven years; there shall be seven years of famine.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041028" id="041028" >28</span>
 And as for the word which I have told Pharao, whatever God intends to do, he has shown to Pharao:  <span class="verse" rel="v001041029" id="041029" >29</span>
 behold, for seven years there is coming great plenty in all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041030" id="041030" >30</span>
 But there shall come seven years of famine after these, and they shall forget the plenty that shall be in all Egypt, and the famine shall consume the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041031" id="041031" >31</span>
 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of the famine that shall be after this, for it shall be very grievous.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041032" id="041032" >32</span>
 And concerning the repetition of the dream to Pharao twice,   it is   because the saying which is from God shall be true, and God will hasten to accomplish it.  
<!-- 041 032 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001041033" id="041033" >33</span>
 Now then, look out a wise and prudent man, and set him over the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041034" id="041034" >34</span>
 And let Pharao make and appoint local governors over the land; and let them take up a fifth part of all the produce of the land of Egypt for the seven years of the plenty.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041035" id="041035" >35</span>
 And let them gather all the food of these seven good years that are coming, and let the corn be gathered under the hand of Pharao; let food be kept in the cities.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041036" id="041036" >36</span>
 And the stored food shall be for the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; and the land shall not be utterly destroyed by the famine.  
<!-- 041 036 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001041037" id="041037" >37</span>
 And the word was pleasing in the sight of Pharao, and in the sight of all his servants.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041038" id="041038" >38</span>
 And Pharao said to all his servants, Shall we find such a man as this, who has the Spirit of God in him?  <span class="verse" rel="v001041039" id="041039" >39</span>
 And Pharao said to Joseph, Since God has showed you all these things, there is not a wiser or more prudent man than you.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041040" id="041040" >40</span>
 You shall be over my house, and all my people shall be obedient to your  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. mouth.  </span>  word; only in the throne will I excel you.  
<!-- 041 040 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001041041" id="041041" >41</span>
 And Pharao said to Joseph, Behold, I set you this day over all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041042" id="041042" >42</span>
 And Pharao took his ring off his hand, and put it on the hand of Joseph, and put on him a robe of fine linen, and put a necklace of gold about his neck.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041043" id="041043" >43</span>
 And he mounted him on the second of his chariots, and a herald made proclamation before him; and he set him over all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041044" id="041044" >44</span>
 And Pharao said to Joseph, I am Pharao; without you no one shall lift up his hand on all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041045" id="041045" >45</span>
 And Pharao called the name of Joseph, Psonthomphanech; and he gave him Aseneth, the daughter of Petephres, priest of Heliopolis, to wife.  
<!-- 041 045 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001041046" id="041046" >46</span>
 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharao, king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharao, and went through all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041047" id="041047" >47</span>
 And the land produced, in the seven years of plenty,   whole   handfuls   of corn  .  <span class="verse" rel="v001041048" id="041048" >48</span>
 And he gathered all the food of the seven years, in which was the plenty in the land of Egypt; and he laid up the food in the cities; the food of the fields of a city round about it he laid up in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041049" id="041049" >49</span>
 And Joseph gathered very much corn as the sand of the sea, until it could not be numbered, for there was no number   of it  .  
<!-- 041 049 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001041050" id="041050" >50</span>
 And to Joseph were born two sons, before the seven years of famine came, which Aseneth, the daughter of Petephres, priest of Heliopolis, bore to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041051" id="041051" >51</span>
 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn, Manasse; for God,   said he  , has made me forget all my toils, and all  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. things belong to my father.  </span>  my father's house.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041052" id="041052" >52</span>
 And he called the name of the second, Ephraim; for God,   said he  , has increased me in the land of my humiliation.  
<!-- 041 052 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001041053" id="041053" >53</span>
 And the seven years of plenty passed away, which were in the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041054" id="041054" >54</span>
 And the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph said; and there was a famine in all the land; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041055" id="041055" >55</span>
 And all the land of Egypt was hungry; and the people cried to Pharao for bread. And Pharao said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph, and do whatever he shall tell you.  
<!-- 041 055 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001041056" id="041056" >56</span>
 And the famine was on the face of all the earth; and Joseph opened all the granaries, and sold to all the Egyptians.  <span class="verse" rel="v001041057" id="041057" >57</span>
 And all countries came to Egypt to buy of Joseph, for the famine prevailed in all the earth.  <p>
<!-- 042 057 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="042001">42</span> And Jacob having seen that there was a sale   of corn   in Egypt, said to his sons, Why are you° indolent?  <span class="verse" rel="v001042002" id="042002" >2</span>
 Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt; go down there, and buy for us a little food, that we may live, and not die.  
<!-- 042 002 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001042003" id="042003" >3</span>
 And the ten brethren of Joseph went down to buy corn out of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042004" id="042004" >4</span>
 But   Jacob   sent not Benjamin, the brother of Joseph, with his brethren; for he said, Lest, haply, disease befall him.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042005" id="042005" >5</span>
 And the sons of Israel came to buy with those that came, for the famine was in the land of Chanaan.  
<!-- 042 005 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001042006" id="042006" >6</span>
 And Joseph was ruler of the land; he sold to all the people of the land. And the brethren of Joseph, having come, did reverence to him,   bowing   with the face to the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042007" id="042007" >7</span>
 And when Joseph saw his brethren, he knew them, and estranged himself from them, and spoke hard words to them; and said to them, Whence are you° come? And they said, Out of the land of Chanaan, to buy food.  
<!-- 042 007 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001042008" id="042008" >8</span>
 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042009" id="042009" >9</span>
 And Joseph remembered his dream, which he saw; and he said to them, You° are spies; to observe the marks of the land are you° come.  
<!-- 042 009 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001042010" id="042010" >10</span>
 But they said, Nay, Sir, we your servants are come to buy food;  <span class="verse" rel="v001042011" id="042011" >11</span>
 we are all sons of one man; we are peaceful, your servants are not spies.  
<!-- 042 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001042012" id="042012" >12</span>
 And he said to them, Nay, but you° are come to observe the marks of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042013" id="042013" >13</span>
 And they said, We your servants are twelve brethren, in the land of Chanaan; and, behold, the youngest is with our father today, but the other one is not.  
<!-- 042 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001042014" id="042014" >14</span>
 And Joseph said to them, This is it that I spoke to you, saying, you° are spies;  <span class="verse" rel="v001042015" id="042015" >15</span>
 herein shall you° be manifested; by the health of Pharao, you° shall not depart hence, unless your younger brother come here.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042016" id="042016" >16</span>
 Send one of you, and take your brother; and go you° to prison, till your words be clear, whether you° speak the truth or not; but, if not, by the health of Pharao, verily you° are spies.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042017" id="042017" >17</span>
 And he put them in prison three days.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042018" id="042018" >18</span>
 And he said to them on the third day, This do, and you° shall live, for I fear God.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042019" id="042019" >19</span>
 If you° be peaceful, let one of your brethren be detained in prison; but go you°, and carry back the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. the purchase of your gift of corn.  </span>  corn you° have purchased.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042020" id="042020" >20</span>
 And bring your younger brother to me, and your words shall be believed; but, if not, you° shall die. And they did so.  
<!-- 042 020 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001042021" id="042021" >21</span>
 And each said to his brother, Yes, indeed, for we are in fault concerning our brother, when we disregarded the anguish of his soul, when he implored us, and we listened not to him; and therefore has this affliction come upon us.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042022" id="042022" >22</span>
 And Ruben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Hurt not the boy, and you° heard me not? and, behold, his blood is required.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042023" id="042023" >23</span>
 But they knew not that Joseph  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. heard them.  </span>  understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042024" id="042024" >24</span>
 And Joseph turned away from them, and wept; and again he came to them, and spoke to them; and he took Symeon from them, and bound him before their eyes.  
<!-- 042 024 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001042025" id="042025" >25</span>
 And Joseph gave orders to fill their vessels with corn, and to return their money to each into his sack, and to give them provision for the way; and it was so done to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042026" id="042026" >26</span>
 And having put the corn on the asses, they departed thence.  
<!-- 042 026 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001042027" id="042027" >27</span>
 And one having opened his sack to give his asses fodder, at the place where they rested, saw also his bundle of money, for it was on the mouth of his sack.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042028" id="042028" >28</span>
 And he said to his brethren, My money has been restored to me, and behold this is in my sack. And their heart was wonder-struck, and they were troubled, saying one to another, What is this that God has done to us?  
<!-- 042 028 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001042029" id="042029" >29</span>
 And they came to their father, Jacob, into the land of Chanaan, and reported to him all that had happened to them, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v001042030" id="042030" >30</span>
 The man, the lord of the land, spoke harsh words to us, and put us in prison as spies of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042031" id="042031" >31</span>
 And we said to him, We are men of peace, we are not spies.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042032" id="042032" >32</span>
 We are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is with his father today in the land of Chanaan.  
<!-- 042 032 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001042033" id="042033" >33</span>
 And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, Herein shall I know that you° are peaceful; leave one brother here with me, and having taken the corn you° have purchased for your family, depart.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042034" id="042034" >34</span>
 And bring to me your younger brother; then I shall know that you° are not spies, but that you° are men of peace: and I will restore you your brother, and you° shall trade in the land.  
<!-- 042 034 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001042035" id="042035" >35</span>
 And it came to pass as they were emptying their sacks, there was each man's bundle of money in his sack; and they and their father saw their bundles of money, and they were afraid.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042036" id="042036" >36</span>
 And their father Jacob said to them, You° have bereaved me. Joseph is not, Symeon is not, and will you° take Benjamin? all these things have come upon me.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001042037" id="042037" >37</span>
 And Ruben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to you; give him into my hand, and I will bring him back to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v001042038" id="042038" >38</span>
 But he said, My son shall not go down with you, because his brother is dead, and he only has been left; and   suppose   it shall come to pass that he is afflicted by the way by which you° go, then you° shall bring down my old age with sorrow to Hades.  <p>
<!-- 043 038 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="043001">43</span> But the famine prevailed in the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v001043002" id="043002" >2</span>
 And it came to pass, when they had finished eating the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, that their father said to them, Go again; buy us a little food.  
<!-- 043 002 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001043003" id="043003" >3</span>
 And Judas spoke to him, saying, The man, the lord of the country, positively testified to us, saying, You° shall not see my face, unless your younger brother be with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v001043004" id="043004" >4</span>
 If, then, you send our brother with us, we will go down, and buy you food;  <span class="verse" rel="v001043005" id="043005" >5</span>
 but if you send not our brother with us, we will not go: for the man spoke to us, saying, You° shall not see my face, unless your younger brother be with you.  
<!-- 043 005 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001043006" id="043006" >6</span>
 And Israel said, Why did you° harm me, inasmuch as you° told the man that you° had a brother?  
<!-- 043 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001043007" id="043007" >7</span>
 And they said, The man closely questioned us about our family also, saying, Does your father yet live, and have you° a brother? and we answered him according to this question: did we know that he would say to us, Bring your brother?  
<!-- 043 007 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001043008" id="043008" >8</span>
 And Judas said to his father Israel, Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you, and our store.  <span class="verse" rel="v001043009" id="043009" >9</span>
 And I engage for him; at my hand do you require him; if I bring him not to you, and place him before you, I shall be guilty toward you for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v001043010" id="043010" >10</span>

 And Israel, their father, said to them, If it be so, do this; take of the fruits of the earth in your vessels, and carry down to the man presents of gum and honey, and frankincense, and stacte, and turpentine, and walnuts.  <span class="verse" rel="v001043012" id="043012" >12</span>
 And take double money in your hands, and the money that was returned in your sacks, carry back with you, lest perhaps it is a mistake.  <span class="verse" rel="v001043013" id="043013" >13</span>

 And my God give you favor in the sight of the man, and send away your other brother, and Benjamin, for I accordingly as I have been bereaved, am bereaved.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001043015" id="043015" >15</span>
 And the men having taken these presents, and the double money, took in their hands also Benjamin; and they rose up and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.  <span class="verse" rel="v001043016" id="043016" >16</span>
 And Joseph saw them and his brother Benjamin, born of the same mother; and he said to the steward of his household, Bring the men into the house, and kill beasts and make ready, for the men are to eat bread with me at noon.  <span class="verse" rel="v001043017" id="043017" >17</span>

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001043018" id="043018" >18</span>
 And the men, when they perceived that they were brought into the house of Joseph, said, We are brought in because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first; even in order to inform against us, and lay it to our charge; to take us for servants, and our asses.  <span class="verse" rel="v001043019" id="043019" >19</span>
 And having approached the man who was over the house of Joseph, they spoke to him in the porch of the house,  <span class="verse" rel="v001043020" id="043020" >20</span>
 saying, We pray   you  , Sir; we came down at first to buy food.  <span class="verse" rel="v001043021" id="043021" >21</span>
 And it came to pass, when we came to unlade, and opened our sacks,   there was   also this money of each in his sack; we have now brought back our money by weight in our hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v001043022" id="043022" >22</span>

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001043023" id="043023" >23</span>
 And he said to them,   God deal   mercifully with you; be not afraid; your God, and the God of your fathers, has given you treasures in your sacks, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        q.d.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001043024" id="043024" >24</span>
 And he brought water to wash their feet; and gave provender to their asses.  <span class="verse" rel="v001043025" id="043025" >25</span>
 And they prepared their gifts, until Joseph came at noon, for they heard that he was going to dine there.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001043026" id="043026" >26</span>
 And Joseph entered into the house, and they brought him the gifts which they had in their hands, into the house; and they did him reverence with their face to the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v001043027" id="043027" >27</span>
 And he asked them, How are you°? and he said to them, Is your father, the old man of whom you° spoke, well? Does he yet live?  <span class="verse" rel="v001043028" id="043028" >28</span>
 And they said, Your servant our father is well; he is yet alive. And he said, Blessed be that man by God; —and they bowed, and did him reverence.

 And Joseph  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. having looked up with, etc.  </span>  lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, born of the same mother; and he said, Is this your younger brother, whom you° spoke of bringing to me? and he said, God have mercy on you, my son.  <span class="verse" rel="v001043030" id="043030" >30</span>
 And Joseph was troubled, for his bowels yearned over his brother, and he sought to weep; and he went into his chamber, and wept there.  
<!-- 043 030 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001043031" id="043031" >31</span>
 And he washed his face and came out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.  <span class="verse" rel="v001043032" id="043032" >32</span>
 And they set on   bread   for him alone, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians feasting with him by themselves, for the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for it is an abomination to the Egyptians.  <span class="verse" rel="v001043033" id="043033" >33</span>
 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his seniority, and the younger according to his youth; and the men  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. were amazed.  </span>  looked with amazement every one at his brother.  <span class="verse" rel="v001043034" id="043034" >34</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="044001">44</span> And Joseph charged the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put the money of each in the mouth of his sack.  <span class="verse" rel="v001044002" id="044002" >2</span>
 And put my silver cup into the sack of the youngest, and the price of his corn. And it was done according to the word of Joseph, as he said.  
<!-- 044 002 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001044003" id="044003" >3</span>
 The morning dawned, and the men were sent away, they and their asses.  <span class="verse" rel="v001044004" id="044004" >4</span>
 And when they had gone out of the city,   and   were not far off, then Joseph said to his steward, Arise, and pursue after the men; and you shall overtake them, and say to them, Why have you° returned evil for good?  <span class="verse" rel="v001044005" id="044005" >5</span>

 And he found them, and spoke to them according to these words.  <span class="verse" rel="v001044007" id="044007" >7</span>
 And they said to him, Why does our lord speak according to these words? far be it from your servants to do according to this word.  <span class="verse" rel="v001044008" id="044008" >8</span>
 If we brought back to you out of the land of Chanaan the money which we found in our sacks, how should we steal silver or gold out of the house of your lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v001044009" id="044009" >9</span>
 With whoever of your servants you shall find the cup, let him die; and, moreover, we will be servants to our lord.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001044010" id="044010" >10</span>

 And they hasted, and took down every man his sack on the ground, and they opened every man his sack.  <span class="verse" rel="v001044012" id="044012" >12</span>
 And he searched, beginning from the oldest, until he came to the youngest; and he found the cup in Benjamin's sack.  <span class="verse" rel="v001044013" id="044013" >13</span>

 And Judas and his brethren came in to Joseph, while he was yet there, and fell on the ground before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v001044015" id="044015" >15</span>
 And Joseph said to them, What is this thing that you° have done? know you° not that a man such as I can surely divine?

<!-- 044 017 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v001044018" id="044018" >18</span>
 And Judas drew near him, and said, I pray, Sir, let your servant speak a word before you, and be not angry with your servant, for you are next to Pharao.  <span class="verse" rel="v001044019" id="044019" >19</span>
 Sir, you asked your servants, saying, Have you° a father or a brother?  <span class="verse" rel="v001044020" id="044020" >20</span>
 And we said to   my   lord, We have a father, an old man, and he has a son of his old age, a young one, and his brother is dead, and he alone has been left behind to his mother, and his father loves him.

 But you said to they servants, Except your younger brother come down with you, you° shall not see my face again.  <span class="verse" rel="v001044024" id="044024" >24</span>
 And it came to pass, when we went up to your servant our father, we reported to him the words of our lord.

 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.  <span class="verse" rel="v001044026" id="044026" >26</span>
 And we said, We shall not be able to go down; but if our younger brother go down with us, we will go down; for we shall not be able to see the man's face, our younger brother not being with us.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001044027" id="044027" >27</span>

 And Joseph commanded his servants the embalmers to embalm his father; and the embalmers embalmed Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v001050003" id="050003" >3</span>
 And they fulfilled forty days for him, for so are the days of embalming numbered; and Egypt mourned for him seventy days.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001050004" id="050004" >4</span>
 And when the days of mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the princes of Pharao, saying, If I have found favor in your sight, speak concerning me in the ears of Pharao, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v001050005" id="050005" >5</span>
 My father adjured me, saying, In the sepulchre which I dug for myself in the land of Chanaan, there you shall bury me; now then I will go up and bury my father, and return again.  <span class="verse" rel="v001050006" id="050006" >6</span>

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001050007" id="050007" >7</span>
 So Joseph went up to bury his father; and all the servants of Pharao went up with him, and the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v001050008" id="050008" >8</span>
 And all the household of Joseph, and his brethren, and all the house of his father, and his kindred; and they left behind the sheep and the oxen in the land of Gesem.  <span class="verse" rel="v001050009" id="050009" >9</span>

 And the inhabitants of the land of Chanaan saw the mourning at the floor of Atad, and said, This is a great mourning to the Egyptians; therefore he called its name, The mourning of Egypt, which is beyond Jordan.

 And when the brethren of Joseph saw that their father was dead, they said,   Let us take heed  , lest at any time Joseph remember evil against us, and recompense to us all the evils which we have done against him.  <span class="verse" rel="v001050016" id="050016" >16</span>
 And they came to Joseph, and said, Your father adjured   us   before his death, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v001050017" id="050017" >17</span>
 Thus say you° to Joseph, Forgive them their injustice and their sin, forasmuch as they have done you evil; and now  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. accept.  </span>  pardon the injustice of the servants of the God of your father.

 And they came to him and said, We, these   persons  , are your servants.  <span class="verse" rel="v001050019" id="050019" >19</span>
 And Joseph said to them, Fear not, for I am God's.  <span class="verse" rel="v001050020" id="050020" >20</span>
 You° took counsel against me for evil, but God took counsel for me for good, that   the matter   might be as   it is   today, and much people might be fed.  <span class="verse" rel="v001050021" id="050021" >21</span>

<p><span class="verse" rel="v001050024" id="050024" >24</span>
 And Joseph spoke to his brethren, saying, I die, and God will surely visit you, and will bring you out of this land to the land concerning which God sware to our fathers, Abraam, Isaac, and Jacob.  <span class="verse" rel="v001050025" id="050025" >25</span>
 And Joseph adjured the sons of Israel, saying, At the visitation with which God shall visit you, then you° shall carry up my bones hence with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v001050026" id="050026" >26</span>
