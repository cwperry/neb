 And the Lord God took the man whom he had formed, and placed him in the garden of Delight, to cultivate and keep it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0012  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 And the Lord God gave a charge to Adam, saying, Of every tree which is in the garden you  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, eat for food.  </span>  may freely eat,  <span class="verse" rel="v0012  017" id="2  017" >17</span>

 And God formed yet farther out of the earth all the wild beasts of the field, and all the birds of the sky, and he brought them to Adam, to see what he would call them, and whatever Adam called any living creature,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. soul.  </span>  that was the name of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0012  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 And Adam  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. called.  </span>  gave names to all the cattle and to all the birds of the sky, and to all the wild beasts of the field, but for Adam there was not found a help like to himself.  <span class="verse" rel="v0012  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 And God brought a trance upon Adam, and he slept, and he took one of his ribs, and filled up the flesh instead thereof.  <span class="verse" rel="v0012  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 And God  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. built.  </span>  formed the rib which he took from Adam into a woman, and brought her to Adam.

<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> And the two were naked, both Adam and his wife, and were not ashamed. Now the serpent was the most crafty of all the brutes on the earth, which the Lord God made, and the serpent said to the woman, Therefore has God said, Eat not of every tree of the garden?  <span class="verse" rel="v0013  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden,  <span class="verse" rel="v0013  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God said, You° shall not eat of it, neither shall you° touch it, lest you° die.  <span class="verse" rel="v0013  004" id="3  004" >4</span>

<p><span class="verse" rel="v0013  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes to look upon and beautiful to contemplate, and having taken of its fruit she ate, and she gave to her husband also with her, and they ate.  <span class="verse" rel="v0013  007" id="3  007" >7</span>

 And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the afternoon; and both Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God in the midst of the trees of the garden.  <span class="verse" rel="v0013  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 And the Lord God called Adam and said to him, Adam, where are you?  <span class="verse" rel="v0013  010" id="3  010" >10</span>

 but Cain and his sacrifices he regarded not, and Cain was exceedingly sorrowful and his countenance fell.  <span class="verse" rel="v0014  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 And the Lord God said to Cain, Why are you become very sorrowful and why is your countenance fallen?  <span class="verse" rel="v0014  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 Hast you not sinned if you have brought it rightly, but not rightly divided it? be still, to you shall be his submission, and you shall rule over him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0014  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 And Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go out into the plain; and it came to pass that when they were in the plain Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and killed him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0014  009" id="4  009" >9</span>

 And the Lord said, What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood cries to me out of the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v0014  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 And now you   are   cursed from the earth which has opened her mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0014  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 When you till the earth, then it shall not continue to give its strength to you: you shall be groaning and trembling on the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0014  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 And Cain said to the Lord God, My crime   is   too great for me to be forgiven.  <span class="verse" rel="v0014  014" id="4  014" >14</span>

 And Lamech said to his wives, Ada and Sella, Hear my voice, you° wives of Lamech, consider my words, because I have slain a man to my  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. wound.  </span>  sorrow and a youth to my  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. hurt.  </span>  grief.  <span class="verse" rel="v0014  024" id="4  024" >24</span>

 went in to Noe into the ark, pairs, male and female of all flesh in which is the breath of life.  <span class="verse" rel="v0017  016" id="7  016" >16</span>
 And they that entered went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded Noe, and the Lord God shut the ark outside of him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0017  017" id="7  017" >17</span>
 And the flood was upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and the water abounded greatly and bore up the ark, and it was lifted on high from off the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0017  018" id="7  018" >18</span>
 And the water prevailed and abounded exceedingly upon the earth, and the ark was borne upon the water.  <span class="verse" rel="v0017  019" id="7  019" >19</span>
 And the water prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, and covered all the high mountains which were under heaven.  <span class="verse" rel="v0017  020" id="7  020" >20</span>
 Fifteen cubits upwards was the water raised, and it covered all the high mountains.  <span class="verse" rel="v0017  021" id="7  021" >21</span>
 And there died all flesh that moved upon the earth, of flying creatures and cattle, and of wild beasts, and every reptile moving upon the earth, and every man.  <span class="verse" rel="v0017  022" id="7  022" >22</span>
 And all things which have the breath of life, and whatever was on the dry land, died.  <span class="verse" rel="v0017  023" id="7  023" >23</span>
 And   God   blotted out every offspring which was upon the face of the earth, both man and beast, and reptiles, and birds of the sky, and they were blotted out from the earth, and Noe was left alone, and those with him in the ark.  <span class="verse" rel="v0017  024" id="7  024" >24</span>
 And the water was raised over the earth an hundred and fifty days.

<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> And God remembered Noe, and all the wild beasts, and all the cattle, and all the birds, and all the reptiles that creep, as many as were with him in the ark, and God brought a wind upon the earth, and the water stayed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 And the fountains of the deep were closed up, and the flood-gates of heaven, and the rain from heaven was withheld.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 And the water subsided, and went off the earth, and after an hundred and fifty days the water was diminished, and the ark rested in the seventh month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  004" id="8  004" >4</span>
 And the water continued to decrease until the tenth month.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 And in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the heads of the mountains were seen.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 And it came to pass after forty days Noe opened the window of the ark which he had made.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  007" id="8  007" >7</span>
 And he sent forth  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. the raven.  </span>  a raven;  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex. + to see if the water had ceased.  </span>  and it went forth and returned not until the water was dried from off the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  008" id="8  008" >8</span>
 And he sent  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. the dove.  </span>  a dove after it to see if the water had ceased from off the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 And the dove not having found rest for her feet, returned to him into the ark, because the water was on all the face of the earth, and he stretched out his hand and took her, and brought her to himself into the ark.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent forth the dove from the ark.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  011" id="8  011" >11</span>
 And the dove returned to him in the evening, and had a leaf of olive, a sprig in her mouth; and Noe knew that the water had ceased from off the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  012" id="8  012" >12</span>
 And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him again any more.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year of the life of Noe, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the water subsided from off the earth, and Noe opened the covering of the ark which he had made, and he saw that the water had subsided from the face of the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 And in the second month the earth was dried, on the twenty-seventh day of the month.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  015" id="8  015" >15</span>
 And the Lord God spoke to Noe, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  016" id="8  016" >16</span>
 Come out from the ark, you and your wife and your sons, and your sons' wives with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  017" id="8  017" >17</span>
 And all the wild beasts as many as are with you, and all flesh both of birds and beasts, and every reptile moving upon the earth, bring forth with you: and increase you° and multiply upon the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  018" id="8  018" >18</span>
 And Noe came forth, and his wife and his sons, and his sons' wives with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  019" id="8  019" >19</span>
 And all the wild beasts and all the cattle and every bird, and every reptile creeping upon the earth after their kind, came forth out of the ark.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  020" id="8  020" >20</span>
 And Noe built an altar to the Lord, and took of all clean beasts, and of all clean birds, and offered a whole burnt offering upon the altar.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  021" id="8  021" >21</span>
 And the Lord God smelled a smell of sweetness, and the Lord God having considered, said, I will not any more curse the earth, because of the works of men, because the imagination of man is intently bent upon evil things from his youth, I will not therefore any more strike all living flesh as I have done.  <span class="verse" rel="v0018  022" id="8  022" >22</span>
 All the days of the earth, seed and harvest, cold and heat, summer and spring, shall not cease by day or night.

<p><span class="chapter" id="9  001">9  </span> And God blessed Noe and his sons, and said to them, Increase and multiply, and fill the earth and have dominion over it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  002" id="9  002" >2</span>
 And the dread and the fear of you shall be upon all the wild beasts of the earth, on all the birds of the sky, and on all things moving upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea, I have placed them under your  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. hands.  </span>  power.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  003" id="9  003" >3</span>

 For your blood of your lives will I require at the hand of all wild beasts, and I will require the life of man at the hand of   his   brother man.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
 He that sheds man's blood, instead of that blood shall his own be shed, for in the image of God I made man.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 But do you° increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and have dominion over it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 And God spoke to Noe, and to his sons with him, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 And behold I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you,  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  010" id="9  010" >10</span>
 and with every  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. living soul.  </span>  living creature with you, of birds and of beasts, and with all the wild beasts of the earth, as many as are with you, of all that come out of the ark.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  011" id="9  011" >11</span>
 And I will establish my covenant with you and all flesh shall not any more die by the water of the flood, and there shall no more be a flood of water to destroy all the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  012" id="9  012" >12</span>
 And the Lord God said to Noe, This   is   the sign of the covenant which I set between me and you, and between every living creature which is with you for perpetual generations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  013" id="9  013" >13</span>
 I set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of covenant between me and the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  014" id="9  014" >14</span>
 And it shall be when I gather clouds upon the earth, that my bow shall be seen in the cloud.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  015" id="9  015" >15</span>
 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you, and between every living soul in all flesh, and there shall no longer be water for a deluge, so as to blot out all flesh.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  016" id="9  016" >16</span>

 Now the sons of Noe which came out of the ark, were Sem, Cham, Japheth. And Cham was father of Chanaan.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  019" id="9  019" >19</span>
 These three are the sons of Noe, of these were men scattered over all the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  020" id="9  020" >20</span>
 And Noe began to be a husbandman, and he planted a vineyard.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  021" id="9  021" >21</span>
 And he drank of the wine, and was drunk, and was naked in his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  022" id="9  022" >22</span>
 And Cham the father of Chanaan saw the nakedness of his father, and he went out and told his two brothers without.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  023" id="9  023" >23</span>
 And Sem and Japheth having taken a garment, put it on both their backs and went backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their face   was   backward, and they saw not the nakedness of their father.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  024" id="9  024" >24</span>
 And Noe recovered from the wine, and knew all that his younger son had done to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  025" id="9  025" >25</span>
 And he said, Cursed be the servant Chanaan, a slave shall he be to his brethren.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  026" id="9  026" >26</span>
 And he said, Blessed   be   the Lord God of Sem, and Chanaan shall be his bond-servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  027" id="9  027" >27</span>
 May God make room for Japheth, and let him dwell in the habitations of Sem, and let Chanaan be his servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  028" id="9  028" >28</span>
 And Noe lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.  <span class="verse" rel="v0019  029" id="9  029" >29</span>

 He was a giant hunter before the Lord God; therefore they say, As Nebrod the giant hunter before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00110  010" id="10  010" >10</span>
 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon, and Orech, and Archad, and Chalanne, in the land of Senaar.  <span class="verse" rel="v00110  011" id="10  011" >11</span>
 Out of that land came Assur, and built Ninevi, and the city Rhooboth, and Chalach,  <span class="verse" rel="v00110  012" id="10  012" >12</span>
 and Dase between Ninevi and Chalach: this is the great city.  <span class="verse" rel="v00110  013" id="10  013" >13</span>

 And the boundaries of the Chananites were from Sidon till one comes to Gerara and Gaza, till one comes to Sodom and Gomorrha, Adama and Seboim, as far as Dasa.  <span class="verse" rel="v00110  020" id="10  020" >20</span>

 All these  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. agreed.  </span>  met with one consent at the salt valley; this is   now   the sea of salt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00114  004" id="14  004" >4</span>
 Twelve years they served Chodollogomor, and the thirteenth year they revolted.  <span class="verse" rel="v00114  005" id="14  005" >5</span>
 And in the fourteenth year came Chodollogomor, and the kings with him, and cut to pieces the giants in Astaroth, and Carnain, and strong nations with them, and the Ommaeans in the city Save.  <span class="verse" rel="v00114  006" id="14  006" >6</span>

 Now the salt valley   consists of   slime-pits. And the king of Sodom fled and the king of Gomorrha, and they fell in there: and they that were left fled to the mountain country.  <span class="verse" rel="v00114  011" id="14  011" >11</span>
 And they took all the cavalry of Sodom and Gomorrha, and all their provisions, and departed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00114  012" id="14  012" >12</span>
 And they took also Lot the son of Abram's brother, and his baggage, and departed, for he lived in Sodom.  <span class="verse" rel="v00114  013" id="14  013" >13</span>

 And Abram said, Master   and   Lord, what will you give me? whereas I am departing without a child, but the son of Masek my home-born female slave, this Eliezer of Damascus   is my heir.    <span class="verse" rel="v00115  003" id="15  003" >3</span>
 And Abram said,   I am grieved   since you have given me no seed, but my home-born   servant   shall succeed me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00115  004" id="15  004" >4</span>
 And immediately there was a voice of the Lord to him, saying, This shall not be your heir; but he that shall come out of you shall be your heir.  <span class="verse" rel="v00115  005" id="15  005" >5</span>
 And he brought him out and said to him, Look up now to heaven, and count the stars, if you shall be able to number them fully, and he said,          Rom 4:18    Thus shall your seed be.  <span class="verse" rel="v00115  006" id="15  006" >6</span>

 And he said, Master   and   Lord, how shall I know that I shall inherit it?  <span class="verse" rel="v00115  009" id="15  009" >9</span>

 And I will establish my covenant between me and you, and I will multiply you exceedingly.  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  003" id="17  003" >3</span>
 And Abram fell upon his face, and God spoke to him, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  004" id="17  004" >4</span>
 And I, behold! my covenant   is   with you, and you shall be a father of a multitude of nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  005" id="17  005" >5</span>
 And your name shall no more be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraam,          Rom 4:17    for I have made you a father of many nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  006" id="17  006" >6</span>
 And I will increase you very exceedingly, and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come out of you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  007" id="17  007" >7</span>
 And I will establish my covenant between you and your seed after you, to their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be your God, and   the God   of your seed after you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  008" id="17  008" >8</span>
 And I will give to you and to your seed after you the land wherein you sojourn, even all the land of Chanaan for an everlasting possession, and I will be to them a God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  009" id="17  009" >9</span>
 And God said to Abraam, You also shall fully keep my covenant, you and your seed after you for their generations.  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  010" id="17  010" >10</span>
 And this   is   the covenant which you shall fully keep between me and you, and between your seed after you for their generations; every male of you shall be circumcised.  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  011" id="17  011" >11</span>
 And you° shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between me and you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  012" id="17  012" >12</span>
 And the child of eight days   old   shall be circumcised by you, every male throughout your generations, and   the servant   born in the house and he that is bought with money, of every son of a stranger, who is not of your seed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  013" id="17  013" >13</span>

 And the uncircumcised male, who shall not be circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin on the eighth day, that soul shall be utterly destroyed from its family, for he has broken my covenant.  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  015" id="17  015" >15</span>
 And God said to Abraam, Sara your wife—her name shall not be called Sara, Sarrha shall be her name.  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  016" id="17  016" >16</span>
 And I will bless her, and give you a son of her, and I will bless him, and he shall become nations, and kings of nations shall be of him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  017" id="17  017" >17</span>
 And Abraam fell upon his face, and laughed; and spoke in his heart, saying, Shall there be a child to one who is a hundred years old, and shall Sarrha who is ninety years old, bear?  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  018" id="17  018" >18</span>
 And Abraam said to God, Let this Ismael live before you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  019" id="17  019" >19</span>
 And God said to Abraam, Yes, behold, Sarrha your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; and I will establish my covenant with him, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to him and to his seed after him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  020" id="17  020" >20</span>
 And concerning Ismael, behold, I have heard you, and, behold, I have blessed him, and will increase him and multiply him exceedingly; twelve nations shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  021" id="17  021" >21</span>
 But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarrha shall bear to you at this time, in the next year.  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  022" id="17  022" >22</span>
 And he left off speaking with him, and God went up from Abraam.  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  023" id="17  023" >23</span>
 And Abraam took Ismael his son, and all his home-born   servants  , and all those bought with money, and every male of the men in the house of Abraam, and he circumcised their foreskins in the time of that day, according as God spoke to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00117  024" id="17  024" >24</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="18  001">18  </span> And God appeared to him by the oak of Mambre, as he sat by the door of his tent at noon.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  002" id="18  002" >2</span>
 And he lifted up his eyes and [*]saw, and behold! three men stood before him; and having seen them he ran to meet them from the door of his tent, and did obeisance to the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  003" id="18  003" >3</span>
 And he said, Lord, if indeed I have found grace in your sight, pass not by your servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  004" id="18  004" >4</span>
 Let water now be brought, and let them wash your feet, and do you° refresh   yourselves   under the tree.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  005" id="18  005" >5</span>
 And I will bring bread, and you° shall eat, and after this you° shall depart on your journey, on account of which   refreshment   you° have turned aside to your servant. And he said, So do, as you have said.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  006" id="18  006" >6</span>
 And Abraam hasted to the tent to Sarrha, and said to her, Hasten, and knead three measures of fine flour, and make cakes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  007" id="18  007" >7</span>
 And Abraam ran to the kine, and took a young calf, tender and good, and gave it to his servant, and he hasted to dress it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  008" id="18  008" >8</span>
 And he took butter and milk, and the calf which he had dressed; and he set them before them, and they did eat, and he stood by them under the tree.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  009" id="18  009" >9</span>
 And he said to him, Where is Sarrha your wife? And he answered and said, Behold! in the tent.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  010" id="18  010" >10</span>
 And he said,          Rom 9:9    I will return and come to you according to this period seasonably, and Sarrha your wife shall have a son; and Sarrha heard at the door of the tent, being behind him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  011" id="18  011" >11</span>
 And Abraam and Sarrha were old, advanced in days, and the custom of women ceased with Sarrha.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  012" id="18  012" >12</span>
 And Sarrha laughed in herself, saying,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. The difference turns on the word Heb. pleasure.

 And the Lord said to Abraam, Why is it that Sarrha has laughed in herself, saying, Shall I then indeed bear? but I am grown old.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  014" id="18  014" >14</span>
 Shall anything be impossible with the Lord? At this time I will return to you seasonably, and Sarrha shall have a son.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  015" id="18  015" >15</span>
 But Sarrha denied, saying, I did not laugh, for she was afraid. And he said to her, Nay, but you did laugh.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  016" id="18  016" >16</span>
 And the men having risen up from thence looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha. And Abraam went with them, attending them on their journey.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  017" id="18  017" >17</span>
 And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraam my servant what things I intend to do?  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  018" id="18  018" >18</span>
 But Abraam shall become a great and populous nation, and in him shall all the nations of the earth be blest.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  019" id="18  019" >19</span>
 For I know that he will order his sons, and his house after him, and they will keep the ways of the Lord, to do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraam all things whatever he has spoken to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  020" id="18  020" >20</span>
 And the Lord said, The cry of Sodom and Gomorrha has been increased towards me, and their sins are very great.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  021" id="18  021" >21</span>
 I will therefore go down and see, if they completely  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. συντελόῦνται. Heb. A.V. have done altogether.  </span>  correspond with the cry which comes to me, and if not, that I may know.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  022" id="18  022" >22</span>
 And the men having departed thence, came to Sodom; and Abraam was still standing before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  023" id="18  023" >23</span>
 And Abraam drew near and said, Wouldest you destroy the righteous with the wicked, and shall the righteous be as the wicked?  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  024" id="18  024" >24</span>
 Should there be fifty righteous in the city, will you destroy them? will you not spare the whole place for the sake of the fifty righteous, if they be in it?  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  025" id="18  025" >25</span>
 By no means shall you do as this thing   is   so as to destroy the righteous with the wicked, so the righteous shall be as the wicked: by no means. You that judge the whole earth, shall you not do right?  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  026" id="18  026" >26</span>
 And the Lord said, If there should be in Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole city, and the whole place for their sakes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  027" id="18  027" >27</span>
 And Abraam answered and said, Now I have begun to speak to my Lord, and I am earth and ashes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  028" id="18  028" >28</span>
 But if the fifty righteous should be diminished to forty-five, will you destroy the whole city because of the five   lacking  ? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I should find there forty-five.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  029" id="18  029" >29</span>
 And he continued to speak to him still, and said, But if there should be found there forty? And he said, I will not destroy it for the forty's sake.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  030" id="18  030" >30</span>
 And he said, Will there be anything   against me  , Lord, if I shall speak? but if there be found there thirty? And he said, I will not destroy it for the thirty's sake.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  031" id="18  031" >31</span>
 And he said, Since I am able to speak to the Lord, what if there should be found there twenty? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I should find there twenty.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  032" id="18  032" >32</span>
 And he said, Will there be anything   against me  , Lord, if I speak yet once? but if there should be found there ten? And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake.  <span class="verse" rel="v00118  033" id="18  033" >33</span>
 And the Lord departed, when he left off speaking to Abraam, and Abraam returned to his place.

<p><span class="chapter" id="19  001">19  </span> And the two angels came to Sodom at evening. And Lot sat by the gate of Sodom, and Lot having seen them, rose up to meet them, and he worshipped with his face to the ground, and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  002" id="19  002" >2</span>
 Behold!   my   lords, turn aside to the house of your servant, and rest from your journey, and wash your feet, and having risen early in the morning you° shall depart on your journey. And they said, Nay, but we will lodge in the street.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  003" id="19  003" >3</span>
 And he constrained them, and they turned aside to him, and they entered into his house, and he made a feast for them, and baked unleavened cakes for them, and they did eat.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  004" id="19  004" >4</span>
 But before they went to sleep, the men of the city, the Sodomites, compassed the house, both young and old, all the people together.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  005" id="19  005" >5</span>
 And they called out Lot, and said to him, Where are the men that went in to you this night? bring them out to us that we may be with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  006" id="19  006" >6</span>
 And Lot went out to them to the porch, and he shut the door after him,  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  007" id="19  007" >7</span>
 and said to them, By no means, brethren, do not act villanously.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  008" id="19  008" >8</span>
 But I have two daughters, who have not known a man. I will bring them out to you, and do you° use them as it may please you, only do not injury to these men, to avoid which they came under the shelter of my  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit. beams.  </span>  roof.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  009" id="19  009" >9</span>
 And they said to him, Stand back there, you came in to sojourn, was it also to judge? Now then we would harm you more than them. And they pressed hard on the man, even Lot, and they drew near to break the door.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  010" id="19  010" >10</span>
 And the men stretched forth their hands and drew Lot in to them into the house, and shut the door of the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  011" id="19  011" >11</span>
 And they struck the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, and they were wearied with seeking the door.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  012" id="19  012" >12</span>
 And the men said to Lot, Hast you here sons-in-law, or sons or daughters, or if you have any other friend in the city, bring them out of this place.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  013" id="19  013" >13</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See Note, Lam 3. 21.  </span>  For we are going to destroy this place; for their cry has been raised up before the Lord, and the Lord has sent us to destroy  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        αὐτήν. Scil. πόλιν.  </span>  it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  014" id="19  014" >14</span>
 And Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law who had married his daughters, and said, Rise up, and depart out of this place, for the Lord is about to destroy the city; but he seemed to be speaking absurdly before his sons-in-law.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  015" id="19  015" >15</span>
 But when it was morning, the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise and take your wife, and your two daughters whom you have, and go forth; lest you also be destroyed with the iniquities of the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  016" id="19  016" >16</span>
 And they were troubled, and the angels laid hold on his hand, and the hand of his wife, and the hands of his two daughters, in that the Lord spared him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  017" id="19  017" >17</span>
 And it came to pass when they brought them out, that they said, Save your own life by all means; look not round to that which is behind, nor stay in all the country round about, escape to the mountain, lest perhaps you be overtaken together with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  018" id="19  018" >18</span>
 And Lot said to them, I pray, Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  019" id="19  019" >19</span>
 since your servant has found mercy before you, and you have magnified your righteousness, in what you do towards me that my soul may live, —but I shall not be able to escape to the mountain, lest perhaps the calamity overtake me and I die.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  020" id="19  020" >20</span>
 Behold this city is near for me to escape there, which is a small one, and there shall I be preserved, is it not little? and my soul shall live because of you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  021" id="19  021" >21</span>
 And he said to him, Behold, I have had respect to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. your countenance.  </span>  you also about this thing, that I should not overthrow the city about which you have spoken.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  022" id="19  022" >22</span>
 Hasten therefore to escape there, for I shall not be able to do anything until you are come there; therefore he called the name of that city, Segor.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  023" id="19  023" >23</span>
 The sun was risen upon the earth, when Lot entered into Segor.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  024" id="19  024" >24</span>
 And the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrha brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  025" id="19  025" >25</span>
 And he overthrew these cities, and all the country round about, and all that lived in the cities, and the plants springing out of the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  026" id="19  026" >26</span>
 And his wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  027" id="19  027" >27</span>
 And Abraam rose up early to go to the place, where he had stood before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  028" id="19  028" >28</span>
 And he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha, and towards the surrounding country, and saw, and behold a flame went up from the earth, as the smoke of a furnace.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  029" id="19  029" >29</span>
 And it came to pass that when God destroyed all the cities of the region round about, God remembered Abraam, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when the Lord overthrew those cities in which Lot lived.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  030" id="19  030" >30</span>
 And Lot went up out of Segor, and lived in the mountain, he and his two daughters with him, for he feared to dwell in Segor; and he lived in a cave, he and his two daughters with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  031" id="19  031" >31</span>
 And the elder said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is no one on the earth who shall come in to us, as it is fit in all the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  032" id="19  032" >32</span>
 Come and let us make our father drink wine, and let us sleep with him, and let us raise up seed from our father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  033" id="19  033" >33</span>
 So they made their father drink wine in that night, and the elder went in and lay with her father that night, and he knew not when he slept and when he rose up.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  034" id="19  034" >34</span>
 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the elder said to the younger, Behold, I slept yesternight with our father, let us make him drink wine in this night also, and do you go in and sleep with him, and let us raise up seed of our father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  035" id="19  035" >35</span>
 So they made their father drink wine in that night also, and the younger went in and slept with her father, and he knew not when he slept, nor when he arose.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  036" id="19  036" >36</span>
 And the two daughters of Lot conceived by their father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  037" id="19  037" >37</span>
 And the elder bore a son and called his name Moab, saying,   He is   of my father. This is the father of the Moabites to this present day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00119  038" id="19  038" >38</span>
 And the younger also bore a son, and called his name Amman, saying, The son of my family. This is the father of the Ammanites to this present day.

 And Abraam said concerning Sarrha his wife, She is my sister, for he feared to say, She is my wife, lest at any time the men of the city should kill him for her sake. So Abimelech king of Gerara sent and took Sarrha.  <span class="verse" rel="v00120  003" id="20  003" >3</span>

 And God said to him in sleep, Yes, I knew that you did this with a pure heart, and I spared you, so that you should not sin against me, therefore I suffered you not to touch her.  <span class="verse" rel="v00120  007" id="20  007" >7</span>
 But now return the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and shall pray for you, and you shall live; but if you restore her not, know that you shall die and all your.  <span class="verse" rel="v00120  008" id="20  008" >8</span>
 And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and he spoke all these words in their ears, and all the men feared exceedingly.  <span class="verse" rel="v00120  009" id="20  009" >9</span>
 And Abimelech called Abraam and said to him, What is this that you have done to us? Have we sinned against you, that you have brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me a deed, which no one ought to do.  <span class="verse" rel="v00120  010" id="20  010" >10</span>
 And Abimelech said to Abraam, What have you seen in   me   that you have done this?  <span class="verse" rel="v00120  011" id="20  011" >11</span>
 And Abraam said, Why I said, Surely there is not the worship of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v00120  012" id="20  012" >12</span>
 For truly she is my sister by my father, but not by my mother, and she became my wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v00120  013" id="20  013" >13</span>
 And it came to pass when God brought me forth out of the house of my father, that I said to her, This righteousness you shall perform to me, in every place into which we may enter, say of me, He is my brother.  <span class="verse" rel="v00120  014" id="20  014" >14</span>
 And Abimelech took a thousand  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. didrachma.  </span>  pieces of silver, and sheep, and calves, and servants, and maidservants, and gave them to Abraam, and he returned him Sarrha his wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v00120  015" id="20  015" >15</span>
 And Abimelech said to Abraam, Behold, my land is before you, dwell wherever it may please you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00120  016" id="20  016" >16</span>
 And to Sarrha he said, Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver, those shall be to you for the price of your countenance, and to all the women with you, and speak the truth in all things.  <span class="verse" rel="v00120  017" id="20  017" >17</span>
 And Abraam prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his women servants, and they bore children.  <span class="verse" rel="v00120  018" id="20  018" >18</span>
 Because the Lord had fast closed from without every womb in the house of Abimelech, because of Sarrha Abraam's wife.

<p><span class="chapter" id="21  001">21  </span> And the Lord visited Sarrha, as he said, and the Lord did to Sarrha, as he spoke.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  002" id="21  002" >2</span>
 And she conceived and bore to Abraam a son in old age, at the set time according as the Lord spoke to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  003" id="21  003" >3</span>
 And Abraam called the name of his son that was born to him, whom Sarrha bore to him, Isaac.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  004" id="21  004" >4</span>
 And Abraam circumcised Isaac on the eighth day, as God commanded him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  005" id="21  005" >5</span>
 And Abraam was a hundred years old when Isaac his son was born to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  006" id="21  006" >6</span>
 And Sarrha said, The Lord has made laughter for me, for whoever shall hear shall rejoice with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  007" id="21  007" >7</span>
 And she said, Who shall say to Abraam that Sarrha suckles a child? for I have born a child in my old age.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  008" id="21  008" >8</span>
 And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraam made a great feast the day that his son Isaac was weaned.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  009" id="21  009" >9</span>
 And Sarrha having seen the son of Agar the Egyptian who was born to Abraam, sporting with Isaac her son,  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  010" id="21  010" >10</span>
 then she said to Abraam,          Gal 4:30    Cast out this bondwoman and her son, for the son of this bondwoman shall not inherit with my son Isaac.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  011" id="21  011" >11</span>
 But the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. Gr. saying, or matter.  </span>  word appeared very hard before Abraam concerning his son.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  012" id="21  012" >12</span>
 But God said to Abraam, Let it not be hard before you concerning the child, and concerning the bondwoman; in all things whatever Sarrha shall say to you, hear her voice, for          Rom 9:7    in Isaac shall your seed be called.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  013" id="21  013" >13</span>
 And moreover I will make the son of this bondwoman a great nation, because he is your seed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  014" id="21  014" >14</span>
 And Abraam rose up in the morning and took loaves and a skin of water, and gave   them   to Agar, and he put the child on her shoulder, and sent her away, and she having departed wandered in the wilderness  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, near Beersheba.  </span>  near the well of the oath.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  015" id="21  015" >15</span>
 And the water failed out of the skin, and she cast the child under a fir tree.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  016" id="21  016" >16</span>
 And she departed and sat down opposite him at a distance, as it were a bow-shot, for she said, Surely I can’t see the death of my child: and she sat opposite him, and the child cried aloud and wept.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  017" id="21  017" >17</span>
 And God heard the voice of the child from the place where he was, and an angel of God called Agar out of heaven, and said to her, What is it, Agar? fear not, for God has heard the voice of the child from the place where he is.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  018" id="21  018" >18</span>
 Rise up, and take the child, and hold him in your hand, for I will make him a great nation.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  019" id="21  019" >19</span>
 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, Gr. living.  </span>  of springing water; and she went and filled the skin with water, and gave the child drink.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  020" id="21  020" >20</span>
 And God was with the child, and he grew and lived in the wilderness, and became an archer.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  021" id="21  021" >21</span>
 And he lived in the wilderness, and his mother took him a wife out of Pharan of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  022" id="21  022" >22</span>
 And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech spoke, and Ochozath  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Not in the Heb. friend of bridegroom, or attendant at marriage.  </span>  his friend, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, to Abraam, saying, God is with you in all things, whatever you may do.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  023" id="21  023" >23</span>
 Now therefore swear to me by God that you will not injure me, nor my seed, nor my name, but according to the righteousness which I have performed with you you shall deal with me, and with the land in which you have sojourned.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  024" id="21  024" >24</span>
 And Abraam said, I will swear.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  025" id="21  025" >25</span>
 And Abraam reproved Abimelech because of the wells of water, which the servants of Abimelech took away.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  026" id="21  026" >26</span>
 And Abimelech said to him, I know not who has done this thing to you, neither did you tell it me, neither heard I it but only today.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  027" id="21  027" >27</span>
 And Abraam took sheep and calves, and gave them to Abimelech, and both made a covenant.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  028" id="21  028" >28</span>
 And Abraam set seven ewe-lambs by themselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  029" id="21  029" >29</span>
 And Abimelech said to Abraam, What are these seven ewe-lambs which you have set alone?  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  030" id="21  030" >30</span>
 And Abraam said, You shall receive the seven ewe-lambs of me, that they may be for me as a witness, that I dug this well.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  031" id="21  031" >31</span>
 Therefore he named the name of that place, The Well of the Oath, for there they both swore.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  032" id="21  032" >32</span>
 And they made a covenant at the well of the oath. And there rose up Abimelech, Ochozath his friend, and Phichol the commander-in-chief of his army, and they returned to the land of the Phylistines.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  033" id="21  033" >33</span>
 And Abraam planted a field at the well of the oath, and called there on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00121  034" id="21  034" >34</span>
 And Abraam sojourned in the land of the Phylistines many days.  
<!-- 22   034 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="22  001">22  </span> And it came to pass after these things that God tempted Abraam, and said to him, Abraam, Abraam; and he said, Behold! I   am here  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  002" id="22  002" >2</span>
 And he said, Take your son, the beloved one, whom you have loved—Isaac, and go into the high land, and offer him there for a whole burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  003" id="22  003" >3</span>
 And Abraam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass, and he took with him two servants, and Isaac his son, and having split wood for a whole burnt offering, he arose and departed, and came to the place of which God spoke to him,  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  004" id="22  004" >4</span>
 on the third day; and Abraam having  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit. look up with.  </span>  lifted up his eyes, saw the place afar off.  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  005" id="22  005" >5</span>
 And Abraam said to his servants, Sit you° here with the ass, and I and the lad will proceed thus far, and having worshipped we will return to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  006" id="22  006" >6</span>
 And Abraam took the wood of the whole burnt offering, and laid it on Isaac his son, and he took into his hands both the fire and the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        μάχαιραν, a short dagger used both for defence and sacrifice, etc.  </span>  knife, and the two went together.  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  007" id="22  007" >7</span>
 And Isaac said to Abraam his father, Father. And he said, What is it, son? And he said, Behold the fire and the wood, where is the sheep for a whole burnt offering?  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  008" id="22  008" >8</span>
 And Abraam said, God will provide himself a sheep for a whole burnt offering,   my   son. And both having gone together,  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  009" id="22  009" >9</span>
 came to the place which God spoke of to him; and there Abraam built the altar, and laid the wood on it, and having bound the feet of Isaac his son together, he laid him on the altar upon the wood.  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  010" id="22  010" >10</span>
 And Abraam stretched forth his hand to take the knife to kill his son.  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  011" id="22  011" >11</span>
 And an angel of the Lord called him out of heaven, and said, Abraam, Abraam. And he said, Behold, I   am here  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  012" id="22  012" >12</span>
 And he said, Lay not your hand upon the child, neither do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, and for my sake you have not spared your beloved son.  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  013" id="22  013" >13</span>
 And Abraam lifted up his eyes and [*]saw, and behold! a ram caught by his horns in a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. in a thicket.  </span>  plant of Sabec; and Abraam went and took the ram, and offered him up for a whole burnt offering in the place of Isaac his son.  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  014" id="22  014" >14</span>
 And Abraam called the name of that place, The Lord has seen; that they might say today, In the mount the Lord was seen.  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  015" id="22  015" >15</span>
 And an angel of the Lord called Abraam the second time out of heaven,  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  016" id="22  016" >16</span>
 saying, I have sworn by myself, says the Lord, because you have done this thing, and on my account have not spared your beloved son,  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  017" id="22  017" >17</span>
           Heb 6:14    surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is by the shore of the sea, and your seed shall inherit the cities of their enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  018" id="22  018" >18</span>
 And          Acts 3:25   in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have listened to my voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  019" id="22  019" >19</span>
 And Abraam returned to his servants, and they arose and went together to the well of the oath; and Abraam lived at the well of the oath.  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  020" id="22  020" >20</span>
 And it came to pass after these things, that it was reported to Abraam,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Men, understood.  </span>  saying, Behold, Melcha herself too has born sons to Nachor your brother,  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  021" id="22  021" >21</span>
 Uz the firstborn, and Baux his brother, and Camuel the father of the Syrians, and Chazad, and  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  022" id="22  022" >22</span>
 Azav and Phaldes, and Jeldaph, and Bathuel, and Bathuel begot Rebecca;  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  023" id="22  023" >23</span>
 these are eight sons, which Melcha bore to Nachor the brother of Abraam.  <span class="verse" rel="v00122  024" id="22  024" >24</span>
 And his concubine whose name was Rheuma, she also bore Tabec, and Taam, and Tochos, and Mocha.

<p><span class="chapter" id="23  001">23  </span> And the life of Sarrha was an hundred and twenty-seven years.  <span class="verse" rel="v00123  002" id="23  002" >2</span>
 And Sarrha died in the city of Arboc, which is in the valley, this is Chebron in the land of Chanaan; and Abraam came to lament for Sarrha and to mourn.  <span class="verse" rel="v00123  003" id="23  003" >3</span>
 And Abraam stood up from before his dead; and Abraam spoke to the sons of Chet, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00123  004" id="23  004" >4</span>
 I am a sojourner and a stranger among you, give me therefore possession of a burying-place among you, and I will bury my dead away from me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00123  005" id="23  005" >5</span>
 And the sons of Chet answered to Abraam, saying, Not so, Sir,  <span class="verse" rel="v00123  006" id="23  006" >6</span>
 but hear us; you are in the midst of us a king from God; bury your dead in our choice sepulchres, for not one of us will by any means withhold his sepulchre from you, so that you should not bury your dead there.  <span class="verse" rel="v00123  007" id="23  007" >7</span>
 And Abraam rose up and did obeisance to the people of the land, to the sons of Chet.  <span class="verse" rel="v00123  008" id="23  008" >8</span>
 And Abraam spoke to them, saying, If you° have it in your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, listen to me, and speak for me to Ephron the son Saar.  <span class="verse" rel="v00123  009" id="23  009" >9</span>
 And let him give me the double cave which he has, which is in a part of his field, let him give it me for the money it is worth for possession of a burying-place among you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00123  010" id="23  010" >10</span>
 Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Chet, and Ephron the Chettite answered Abraam and spoke in the hearing of the sons of Chet, and of all who entered the city, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00123  011" id="23  011" >11</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. be with me.  </span>  Attend to me, my lord, and hear me, I give to you the field and the cave which is in it; I have given it you before all my country men; bury your dead.  <span class="verse" rel="v00123  012" id="23  012" >12</span>
 And Abraam did obeisance before the people of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00123  013" id="23  013" >13</span>
 And he said in the ears of Ephron before the people of the land, Since you are on my side, hear me; take the price of the field from me, and I will bury my dead there.  <span class="verse" rel="v00123  014" id="23  014" >14</span>
 But Ephron answered Abraam, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00123  015" id="23  015" >15</span>
 Nay, my lord, I have heard indeed, the land   is worth   four hundred silver didrachmas, but what can this be between me and you? nay, do you bury your dead.  <span class="verse" rel="v00123  016" id="23  016" >16</span>
 And Abraam listened to Ephron, and Abraam rendered to Ephron the money, which he mentioned in the ears of the sons of Chet, four hundred didrachmas of silver approved with merchants.  <span class="verse" rel="v00123  017" id="23  017" >17</span>
 And the field of Ephron, which was in Double Cave, which is opposite Mambre, the field and the cave, which was in it, and every tree which was in the field, and whatever is in its borders round about, were made sure in its borders round about, were made sure  <span class="verse" rel="v00123  018" id="23  018" >18</span>
 to Abraam for a possession, before the sons of Chet, and all that entered into the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v00123  019" id="23  019" >19</span>
 After this Abraam buried Sarrha his wife in the Double Cave of the field, which is opposite Mambre, this is Chebron in the land of Chanaan.  <span class="verse" rel="v00123  020" id="23  020" >20</span>
 So the field and the cave which was in it were made sure to Abraam for possession of a burying place, by the sons of Chet.

<p><span class="chapter" id="24  001">24  </span> And Abraam was old, advanced in days, and the Lord blessed Abraam in all things.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  002" id="24  002" >2</span>

 and I will adjure you by the Lord the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that you take not a wife for my son Isaac from the daughters of the Chananites, with whom I dwell, in the midst of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  004" id="24  004" >4</span>
 But you shall go instead to my country, where I was born, and to my tribe, and you shall take from thence a wife for my son Isaac.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  005" id="24  005" >5</span>

 The Lord the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, who took me out of my father's house, and out of the land whence I sprang, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, I will give this land to you and to your seed, he shall send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife to my son from thence.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  008" id="24  008" >8</span>

 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraam, and swore to him concerning this matter.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  010" id="24  010" >10</span>
 And the servant took ten camels of his master's camels, and   he took   of all the goods of his master with him, and he arose and went into Mesopotamia to the city of Nachor.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  011" id="24  011" >11</span>

 And it shall be, the virgin to whoever I shall say, Incline your water-pot, that I may drink, and she shall say, Drink you, and I will give your camels drink, until they shall have done drinking—even this one you have prepared for your servant Isaac, and hereby shall I know that you have dealt mercifully with my master Abraam.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  015" id="24  015" >15</span>
 And it came to pass before he had done speaking in his mind, that behold, Rebecca the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Melcha, the wife of Nachor, and   the same    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        i.e. Nachor.  </span>  the brother of Abraam, came forth, having a water-pot on her shoulders.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  016" id="24  016" >16</span>
 And the virgin was very beautiful in appearance, she was a virgin, a man had not known her; and she went down to the well, and filled her water-pot, and came up.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  017" id="24  017" >17</span>
 And the servant ran up to meet her, and said, Give me a little water to drink out of your pitcher;  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  018" id="24  018" >18</span>
 and she said, Drink, Sir; and she hasted, and let down the pitcher upon her arm, and gave him to drink, till he ceased drinking.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  019" id="24  019" >19</span>
 And she said, I will also draw water for your camels, till they shall all have drunk.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  020" id="24  020" >20</span>
 And she hasted, and emptied the water-pot into the trough, and ran to the well to draw again, and drew water for all the camels.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  021" id="24  021" >21</span>
 And the man took great notice of her, and remained silent to know whether the Lord had made his way prosperous or not.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  022" id="24  022" >22</span>
 And it came to pass when all the camels ceased drinking, that the man took golden ear-rings, each of a drachm weight, and he   put   two bracelets on her hands, their weight was ten pieces of gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  023" id="24  023" >23</span>
 And he asked her, and said, Whose daughter are you? Tell me if there is room for us to lodge with your father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  024" id="24  024" >24</span>
 And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bathuel the son of Melcha, whom she bore to Nachor.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  025" id="24  025" >25</span>
 And she said to him, We have both straw and much provender, and a place for resting.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  026" id="24  026" >26</span>
 And the man being well pleased, worshipped the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  027" id="24  027" >27</span>
 and said, Blessed be the Lord the God of my master Abraam, who has not suffered his righteousness to fail, nor his truth from my master, and the Lord has brought me prosperously to the house of the brother of my lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  028" id="24  028" >28</span>
 And the damsel ran and reported to the house of her mother according to these words.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  029" id="24  029" >29</span>
 And Rebecca had a brother whose name was Laban; and Laban ran out to meet the man, to the well.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  030" id="24  030" >30</span>
 And it came to pass when he saw the ear-rings and the bracelets on the hands of his sister, and when he heard the words of Rebecca his sister, saying, Thus the man spoke to me, that he went to the man, as he stood by the camels at the well.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  031" id="24  031" >31</span>
 And he said to him, Come in hither, you blessed of the Lord, why stand you without, whereas I have prepared the house and a place for the camels?  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  032" id="24  032" >32</span>
 And the man entered into the house, and unloaded the camels, and gave the camels straw and provender, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men that were with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  033" id="24  033" >33</span>
 And he set before them loaves to eat; but he said, I will not eat, until I have  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. spoken my words.  </span>  told my errand. And he said, Speak on.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  034" id="24  034" >34</span>
 And he said, I am a servant of Abraam;  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  035" id="24  035" >35</span>
 and the Lord has blessed my master greatly, and he is exalted, and he has given him sheep, and calves, and silver, and gold, servants and servant-maids, camels, and asses.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  036" id="24  036" >36</span>
 And Sarrha my master's wife bore one son to my master after he had grown old; and he gave him whatever he had.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  037" id="24  037" >37</span>
 And my master caused me to swear, saying, You shall not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Chananites, among whom I sojourn in their land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  038" id="24  038" >38</span>
 But you shall go to the house of my father, and to my tribe, and you shall take thence a wife for my son.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  039" id="24  039" >39</span>
 And I said to my master, Haply the woman will not go with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  040" id="24  040" >40</span>
 And he said to me, The Lord God to whom I have been acceptable in his presence, himself shall send out his angel with you, and shall prosper your journey, and you shall take a wife for my son of my tribe, and of the house of my father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  041" id="24  041" >41</span>
 Then shall you be clear from my curse, for whenever you shall have come to my tribe, and they shall not give her to you, then shall you be clear from my oath.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  042" id="24  042" >42</span>
 And having come this day to the well, I said, Lord God of my master Abraam, if you prosper my journey on which I am now going,  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  043" id="24  043" >43</span>
 behold, I stand by the well of water, and the daughters of the men of the city come forth to draw water, and it shall be   that   the damsel to whom I shall say, Give me a little water to drink out of your pitcher,  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  044" id="24  044" >44</span>
 and she shall say to me, Both drink you, and I will draw water for your camels, this   shall be   the wife whom the Lord has prepared for his own servant Isaac; and hereby shall I know that you have wrought mercy with my master Abraam.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  045" id="24  045" >45</span>
 And it came to pass before I had done speaking in my mind, straightway Rebecca came forth, having her pitcher on her shoulders; and she went down to the well, and drew water; and I said to her, Give me to drink.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  046" id="24  046" >46</span>
 And she hasted and let down her pitcher on her arm  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. from herself.  </span>  from her head, and said, Drink you, and I will give your camels drink; and I drank, and she gave the camels drink.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  047" id="24  047" >47</span>
 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter are you? tell me; and she said, I am daughter of Bathuel the son of Nachor, whom Melcha bore to him; and I put on her the ear-rings, and the bracelets on her hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  048" id="24  048" >48</span>
 And being well-pleased I worshipped the Lord, and I blessed the Lord the God of my master Abraam, who has prospered me in a true way, so that I should take the daughter of my master's brother for his son.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  049" id="24  049" >49</span>
 If then you°   will   deal mercifully and justly with my lord,   tell me  , and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  050" id="24  050" >50</span>
 And Laban and Bathuel answered and said, This matter has come forth from the Lord, we shall not be able to answer you bad or good.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  051" id="24  051" >51</span>
 Behold, Rebecca is before you, take her and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. run away.  </span>  go away, and let her be wife to the son of your master, as the Lord has said.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  052" id="24  052" >52</span>
 And it came to pass when the servant of Abraam heard these words, he bowed himself to the Lord down to the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  053" id="24  053" >53</span>
 And the servant having brought forth jewels of silver and gold and raiment, gave them to Rebecca, and gave gifts to her brother, and to her mother.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  054" id="24  054" >54</span>
 And both he and the men with him ate and drank and went to sleep. And he arose in the morning and said, Send me away, that I may go to my master.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  055" id="24  055" >55</span>
 And her brethren and her mother said, Let the virgin remain with us about ten days, and after that she shall depart.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  056" id="24  056" >56</span>
 But he said to them, Hinder me not, for the Lord has prospered my journey for me; send me away, that I may depart to my master.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  057" id="24  057" >57</span>
 And they said, Let us call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  058" id="24  058" >58</span>
 And they called Rebecca, and said to her, Will you go with this man? and she said, I will go.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  059" id="24  059" >59</span>
 So they sent forth Rebecca their sister, and her goods, and the servant of Abraam, and his attendants.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  060" id="24  060" >60</span>
 And they blessed Rebecca, and said to her, You are our sister; become you thousands of myriads, and let your seed possess the cities of their enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  061" id="24  061" >61</span>
 And Rebecca rose up and her maidens, and they mounted the camels and went with the man; and the servant having taken up Rebecca, departed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  062" id="24  062" >62</span>
 And Isaac went through the wilderness to the well of the vision, and he lived in the land toward the south.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  063" id="24  063" >63</span>
 And Isaac went forth into the plain toward evening to meditate; and having lifted up his eyes, he saw camels coming.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  064" id="24  064" >64</span>
 And Rebecca lifted up her eyes, and saw Isaac; and she alighted briskly from the camel,  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  065" id="24  065" >65</span>
 and said to the servant, Who is that man that walks in the plain to meet us? And the servant said, This is my master; and she took her veil and covered herself.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  066" id="24  066" >66</span>
 And the servant told Isaac all  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit. all the words which. Hebraism.  </span>  that he had done.  <span class="verse" rel="v00124  067" id="24  067" >67</span>
 And Isaac went into the house of his mother, and took Rebecca, and she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted for Sarrha his mother.

<p><span class="chapter" id="25  001">25  </span> And Abraam again took a wife, whose name was Chettura.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  002" id="25  002" >2</span>
 And she bore to him Zombran, and Jezan, and Madal, and Madiam, and Jesboc, and Soie.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  003" id="25  003" >3</span>
 And Jezan begot Saba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were the Assurians and the Latusians, and Laomim.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  004" id="25  004" >4</span>
 And the sons of Madiam   were   Gephar and Aphir, and Enoch, and Abeida, and Eldaga; all these were sons of Chettura.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  005" id="25  005" >5</span>
 But Abraam gave all his possessions to Isaac his son.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  006" id="25  006" >6</span>
 But to the sons of his concubines Abraam gave gifts, and he sent them away from his son Isaac, while he was yet living, to the east into the country of the east.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  007" id="25  007" >7</span>
 And these   were   the years of the days of the life of Abraam as many as he lived, a hundred and seventy-five years.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  008" id="25  008" >8</span>
 And Abraam failing died in a good old age, an old man and full of days, and was added to his people.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  009" id="25  009" >9</span>
 And Isaac and Ismael his sons buried him in the double cave, in the field of Ephron the son of Saar the Chettite, which is over against Mambre:  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  010" id="25  010" >10</span>
    even   the field and the cave which Abraam bought of the sons of Chet; there they buried Abraam and Sarrha his wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  011" id="25  011" >11</span>
 And it came to pass after Abraam was dead, that God blessed Isaac his son, and Isaac lived by the well of the vision.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  012" id="25  012" >12</span>
 And these   are   the generations of Ismael the son of Abraam, whom Agar the Egyptian the handmaid of Sarrha bore to Abraam.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  013" id="25  013" >13</span>
 And these   are   the names of the sons of Ismael, according to the names of their generations. The firstborn of Ismael, Nabaioth, and Kedar, and Nabdeel, and Massam,  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  014" id="25  014" >14</span>
 and Masma, and Duma, and Masse,  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  015" id="25  015" >15</span>
 and Choddan, and Thaeman, and Jetur, and Naphes, and Kedma.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  016" id="25  016" >16</span>
 These   are   the sons of Ismael, and these are their names in their tents and in their dwellings, twelve princes according to their nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  017" id="25  017" >17</span>
 And these   are   the years of the life of Ismael, a hundred and thirty-seven years; and he failed and died, and was added to his  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. family.  </span>  fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  018" id="25  018" >18</span>
 And he lived from Evilat to Sur, which is opposite Egypt, until one comes to the Assyrians; he lived in the presence of all his brethren.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  019" id="25  019" >19</span>
 And these   are   the generations of Isaac the son of Abraam.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  020" id="25  020" >20</span>
 Abraam begot Isaac. And Isaac was forty years old when he took as wife Rebecca, daughter of Bathuel the Syrian, out of Syrian Mesopotamia, sister of Laban the Syrian.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  021" id="25  021" >21</span>
 And Isaac prayed the Lord concerning Rebecca his wife, because she was barren; and the Lord heard him, and his wife Rebecca conceived in her womb.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  022" id="25  022" >22</span>
 And the babes leaped within her; and she said, If it will be so with me, why is this to me? And she went to enquire of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  023" id="25  023" >23</span>
 And the Lord said to her, There are two nations in your womb, and two peoples shall be separated from your belly, and one people shall excel the other, and the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. the greater shall serve the less.

 And the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered, and she had twins in her womb.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  025" id="25  025" >25</span>
 And the first came out red, hairy all over like a skin; and she called his name Esau.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  026" id="25  026" >26</span>
 And after this came forth his brother, and his hand took hold of the heel of Esau; and she called his name Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when Rebecca bore them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  027" id="25  027" >27</span>
 And the lads grew, and Esau was a man skilled in hunting, dwelling in the country, and Jacob a simple man, dwelling in a house.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  028" id="25  028" >28</span>
 And Isaac loved Esau, because his venison was his food, but Rebecca loved Jacob.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  029" id="25  029" >29</span>
 And Jacob cooked pottage, and Esau came from the plain, fainting.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  030" id="25  030" >30</span>
 And Esau said to Jacob, Let me taste of that red pottage, because I am fainting; therefore his name was called Edom.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  031" id="25  031" >31</span>
 And Jacob said to Esau, Sell me this day your birthright.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  032" id="25  032" >32</span>
 And Esau said, Behold, I am going to die, and for what good does this birthright   belong   to me?  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  033" id="25  033" >33</span>
 And Jacob said to him, Swear to me this day; and he swore to him; and Esau sold his birthright to Jacob.  <span class="verse" rel="v00125  034" id="25  034" >34</span>
 And Jacob gave bread to Esau, and pottage of lentiles; and he ate and drank, and he arose and departed; so Esau slighted his birthright.

<p><span class="chapter" id="26  001">26  </span> And there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine, which was in the time of Abraam; and Isaac went to Abimelech the king of the Phylistines to Gerara.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  002" id="26  002" >2</span>
 And the Lord appeared to him and said, Go not down to Egypt, but dwell in the land, which I shall tell you of.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  003" id="26  003" >3</span>
 And sojourn in this land; and I will be with you, and bless you, for I will give to you and to your seed all this land; and I will establish my oath which I swore to your father Abraam.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  004" id="26  004" >4</span>
 And I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven; and I will give to your seed all this land, and all the nations of the earth shall be blest in your seed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  005" id="26  005" >5</span>
 Because Abraam your father listened to my voice, and kept my injunctions, and my commandments, and my ordinances, and my statutes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  006" id="26  006" >6</span>
 And Isaac lived in Gerara.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  007" id="26  007" >7</span>
 And the men of the place questioned him concerning Rebecca his wife, and he said, She is my sister, for he feared to say, She is my wife, lest at any time the men of the place should kill him because of Rebecca, because she was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. fair of countenance.  </span>  fair.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  008" id="26  008" >8</span>
 And he remained there a long time, and Abimelech the king of Gerara leaned to look through the window, and saw Isaac sporting with Rebecca his wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  009" id="26  009" >9</span>
 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said to him, Is she then your wife? why have you said, She is my sister? And Isaac said to him,   I did so  , for I said, Lest at any time I die on her account.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  010" id="26  010" >10</span>
 And Abimelech said to him, Why have you done this to us? one of my kindred  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        q.d. had almost.  </span>  within a little had lain with your wife, and you would have brought   a sin of   ignorance upon us.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  011" id="26  011" >11</span>
 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying Every man that touches this man and his wife shall be liable to death.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  012" id="26  012" >12</span>
 And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found in that year barley and hundred-fold, and the Lord blessed him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  013" id="26  013" >13</span>
 And the man was exalted, and advancing he increased, till he became very great.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  014" id="26  014" >14</span>
 And he had cattle of sheep, and cattle of oxen, and many tilled lands, and the Phylistines envied him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  015" id="26  015" >15</span>
 And all the wells which the servants of his father had dug in the time of his father, the Phylistines stopped them, and filled them with earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  016" id="26  016" >16</span>
 And Abimelech said to Isaac, Depart from us, for you are become much mightier than we.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  017" id="26  017" >17</span>
 And Isaac departed thence, and rested in the valley of Gerara, and lived there.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  018" id="26  018" >18</span>
 And Isaac dug again the wells of water, which the servants of his father Abraam had dug, and the Phylistines had stopped them, after the death of his father Abraam; and he gave them names, according to the names by which his father named them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  019" id="26  019" >19</span>
 And the servants of Isaac dug in the valley of Gerara, and they found there a well of living water.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  020" id="26  020" >20</span>
 And the shepherds of Gerara strove with the shepherds of Isaac, saying that the water was theirs; and they called the name of the well, Injury, for they injured him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  021" id="26  021" >21</span>
 And having departed thence he dug another well, and they strove also for that; and he named the name of it, Enmity.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  022" id="26  022" >22</span>
 And he departed thence and dug another well; and they did not strive about that; and he named the name of it, Room, saying, Because now the Lord has made room for us, and has increased us upon the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  023" id="26  023" >23</span>
 And he went up thence to the well of the oath.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  024" id="26  024" >24</span>
 And the Lord appeared to him in that night, and said, I am the God of Abraam your father; fear not, for I am with you, and I will bless you, and multiply your seed for the sake of Abraam your father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  025" id="26  025" >25</span>
 And he built there an altar, and called on the name of the Lord, and there he pitched his tent, and there the servants of Isaac dug a well in the valley of Gerara.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  026" id="26  026" >26</span>
 And Abimelech came to him from Gerara, and so did Ochozath his  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        q.d. he that gives away in marriage.  </span>  friend, and Phichol the commander-in-chief of his army.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  027" id="26  027" >27</span>
 And Isaac said to them, Therefore have you° come to me? whereas you° hated me, and sent me away from you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  028" id="26  028" >28</span>
 And they said, We have surely seen that the Lord was with you, and we said, Let there be an oath between us and you, and we will make a covenant with you,  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  029" id="26  029" >29</span>
 that you shall do no wrong by us, as we have not abhorred you, and according as we have treated you well, and have sent you forth peaceably; and now you are blessed of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  030" id="26  030" >30</span>
 And he made a feast for them, and they ate and drank.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  031" id="26  031" >31</span>
 And they arose in the morning, and swore each to his neighbor; and Isaac sent them forth, and they departed from him in safety.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  032" id="26  032" >32</span>
 And it came to pass in that day, that the servants of Isaac came and told him of the well which they had dug; and they said, We have not found water.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  033" id="26  033" >33</span>
 And he called it, Oath: therefore he called the name of that city, the Well of Oath, until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  034" id="26  034" >34</span>
 And Esau was forty years old; and he took as wife Judith the daughter of Beoch the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex. Hivite.  </span>  Chettite, and Basemath, daughter of Helon the Chettite.  <span class="verse" rel="v00126  035" id="26  035" >35</span>
 And they were provoking to Isaac and Rebecca.

<p><span class="chapter" id="27  001">27  </span> And it came to pass after Isaac was old, that his eyes were dimmed so that he could not see; and he called Esau, his elder son, and said to him, My son; and he said, Behold, I   am here  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  002" id="27  002" >2</span>
 And he said, Behold, I am grown old, and know not the day of my death.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  003" id="27  003" >3</span>
 Now then take the weapons, both your quiver and your bow, and go into the plain, and get me venison,  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  004" id="27  004" >4</span>
 and make me meats, as I like them, and bring them to me that I may eat, that my soul may bless you, before I die.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  005" id="27  005" >5</span>
 And Rebecca heard Isaac speaking to Esau his son; and Esau went to the plain to procure venison for his father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  006" id="27  006" >6</span>
 And Rebecca said to Jacob her younger son, Behold, I heard your father speaking to Esau your brother, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  007" id="27  007" >7</span>
 Bring me venison, and prepare me meats, that I may eat and bless you before the Lord before I die.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  008" id="27  008" >8</span>
 Now then, my son, listen to me, as I command you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  009" id="27  009" >9</span>
 And go to the cattle and take for me thence two kids, tender and good, and I will make them meats for your father, as he likes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  010" id="27  010" >10</span>
 And you shall bring them in to your father, and he shall eat, that your father may bless you before he dies.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  011" id="27  011" >11</span>
 And Jacob said to his mother Rebecca, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I a smooth man.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  012" id="27  012" >12</span>
 Peradventure my father may feel me, and I shall be before him as one ill-intentioned, and I shall bring upon me a curse, and not a blessing.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  013" id="27  013" >13</span>
 And his mother said to him, On me be your curse, son; only listen to my voice, and go and bring   them   me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  014" id="27  014" >14</span>
 So he went and took and brought them to his mother; and his mother made meats, as his father liked   them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  015" id="27  015" >15</span>
 And Rebecca having taken the fine raiment of her elder son Esau which was with her in the house, put it on Jacob her younger son.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  016" id="27  016" >16</span>
 And she put on his arms the skins of the kids, and on the bare parts of his neck.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  017" id="27  017" >17</span>
 And she gave the meats, and the loaves which she had prepared, into the hands of Jacob her son.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  018" id="27  018" >18</span>
 And he brought   them   to his father, and said, Father; and he said, Behold I   am here  ; who are you, son?  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  019" id="27  019" >19</span>
 And Jacob said to his father, I, Esau your firstborn, have done as you told me; rise, sit, and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  020" id="27  020" >20</span>
 And Isaac said to his son, What is this which you have quickly found? And he said, That which the Lord your God presented before me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  021" id="27  021" >21</span>
 And Isaac said to Jacob, Draw night to me, and I will feel you, son, if you are my son Esau or not.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  022" id="27  022" >22</span>
 And Jacob drew near to his father Isaac, and he felt him, and said, The voice   is   Jacob's voice, but the hands   are   the hands of Esau.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  023" id="27  023" >23</span>
 And he knew him not, for his hands were as the hands of his brother Esau, hairy; and he blessed him,  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  024" id="27  024" >24</span>
 and he said, Are you my son Esau? and he said, I   am  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  025" id="27  025" >25</span>
 And he said, Bring hither, and I will eat of your venison, son, that my soul may bless you; and he brought   it   near to him, and he ate, and he brought him wine, and he drank.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  026" id="27  026" >26</span>
 And Isaac his father said to him, Draw near to me, and kiss me, son.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  027" id="27  027" >27</span>
 And he drew near and kissed him, and smelled the smell of his garments, and blessed him, and said, Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of an abundant field, which the Lord has blessed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  028" id="27  028" >28</span>
 And may God give you of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and abundance of corn and wine.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  029" id="27  029" >29</span>
 And let nations serve you, and princes bow down to you, and be you lord of your brother, and the sons of your father shall do you reverence; accursed is he that curses you, and blessed is he that blesses you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  030" id="27  030" >30</span>
 And it came to pass after Isaac had ceased blessing his son Jacob, it even came to pass, just when Jacob had gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  031" id="27  031" >31</span>
 And he also had made meats and brought them to his father; and he said to his father, Let my father arise and eat of his son's venison, that your soul may bless me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  032" id="27  032" >32</span>
 And Isaac his father said to him, Who are you? And he said, I am your firstborn son Esau.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  033" id="27  033" >33</span>
 And Isaac was amazed with very great amazement, and said, Who then is it that has procured venison for me and brought it to me? and I have eaten of all before you came, and I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  034" id="27  034" >34</span>
 And it came to pass when Esau heard the words of his father Isaac, he cried out with a great and very bitter cry, and said, Bless, I pray you, me also, father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  035" id="27  035" >35</span>
 And he said to him, Your brother has come with subtlety, and taken your blessing.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  036" id="27  036" >36</span>
 And he said, Rightly was his name called Jacob, for behold! this second time has he supplanted me; he has both taken my birthright, and now he has taken my blessing; and Esau said to his father, Hast you not left a blessing for me, father?  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  037" id="27  037" >37</span>
 And Isaac answered and said to Esau, If I have made him your lord, and have made all his brethren his servants, and have strengthened him with corn and wine, what then shall I do for you, son?  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  038" id="27  038" >38</span>
 And Esau said to his father, Hast you   only   one blessing, father? Bless, I pray you, me also, father. And  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. — Isaac being troubled.  </span>  Isaac being troubled, Esau cried aloud and wept.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  039" id="27  039" >39</span>
 And Isaac his father answered and said to him, Behold, your dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  040" id="27  040" >40</span>
 And you shall live by your sword, and shall serve your brother; and there shall be   a time   when you shall break and loosen his yoke from off your neck.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  041" id="27  041" >41</span>
 And Esau was angry with Jacob because of the blessing, with which his father blessed him; and Esau said in his mind, Let the days of my father's mourning draw near, that I may kill my brother Jacob.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  042" id="27  042" >42</span>
 And the words of Esau her elder son were reported to Rebecca, and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, Esau your brother threatens you to kill you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  043" id="27  043" >43</span>
 Now then, my son, hear my voice, and rise and depart quickly into Mesopotamia to Laban my brother into Charran.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  044" id="27  044" >44</span>
 And dwell with him certain days, until your brother's anger  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  045" id="27  045" >45</span>
 and rage depart from you, and he forget what you have done to him; and I will send and fetch you thence, lest at any time I should be bereaved of you both in one day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00127  046" id="27  046" >46</span>
 And Rebecca said to Isaac, I am weary of my life, because of the daughters of the sons of Chet; if Jacob shall take a wife of the daughters of this land, therefore should I live?

<p><span class="chapter" id="28  001">28  </span> And Isaac having called for Jacob, blessed him, and charged him, saying, You shall not take a wife of the daughters of the Chananites.  <span class="verse" rel="v00128  002" id="28  002" >2</span>
 Rise and depart quickly into Mesopotamia, to the house of Bathuel the father of your mother, and take to yourself thence a wife of the daughters of Laban your mother's brother.  <span class="verse" rel="v00128  003" id="28  003" >3</span>

 And Esau also having seen that the daughters of Chanaan were evil before his father Isaac,  <span class="verse" rel="v00128  009" id="28  009" >9</span>
 Esau went to Ismael, and took Maeleth the daughter of Ismael, the son of Abraam, the sister of Nabeoth, a wife in addition to his   other   wives.  <span class="verse" rel="v00128  010" id="28  010" >10</span>
 And Jacob went forth from the well of the oath, and departed into Charrhan.  <span class="verse" rel="v00128  011" id="28  011" >11</span>
 And came to a certain place and slept there, for the sun had gone down; and he took   one   of the stones of the place, and put it at his head, and lay down to sleep in that place,  <span class="verse" rel="v00128  012" id="28  012" >12</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="29  001">29  </span> And Jacob  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. having lifted up his feet, went, etc.  </span>  started and went to the land of the east to Laban, the son of Bathuel the Syrian, and the brother of Rebecca, mother of Jacob and Esau.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  002" id="29  002" >2</span>
 And he looks, and behold! a well in the plain; and there were there three flocks of sheep resting at it, for out of that well they watered the flocks, but there was a great stone at the mouth of the well.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  003" id="29  003" >3</span>
 And there were all the flocks gathered, and they used to roll away the stone from the mouth of the well, and water the flocks, and set the stone again in its place on the mouth of the well.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  004" id="29  004" >4</span>
 And Jacob said to them, Brethren, whence are you°? and they said, We are of Charrhan.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  005" id="29  005" >5</span>
 And he said to them, Know you° Laban, the son of Nachor? and they said, We do know   him  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  006" id="29  006" >6</span>
 And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, He is well. And behold Rachel his daughter came with the sheep.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  007" id="29  007" >7</span>
 And Jacob said, it is yet high day, it is not yet time that the flocks be gathered together; water you° the flocks, and depart and feed them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  008" id="29  008" >8</span>
 And they said, We shall not be able, until all the shepherds be gathered together, and they shall roll away the stone from the mouth of the well, then we will water the flocks.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  009" id="29  009" >9</span>
 While he was yet speaking to them, behold, Rachel the daughter of Laban came with her father's sheep, for she fed the sheep of her father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  010" id="29  010" >10</span>
 And it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother, that Jacob came and rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  011" id="29  011" >11</span>
 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and cried with a loud voice and wept.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  012" id="29  012" >12</span>
 And he told Rachel that he was the near relative of her father, and the son of Rebecca; and she ran and reported to her father according to these words.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  013" id="29  013" >13</span>
 And it came to pass when Laban heard the name of Jacob, his sister's son, he ran to meet him, and embraced and kissed him, and brought him into his house; and he told Laban all these sayings.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  014" id="29  014" >14</span>
 And Laban said to him, You are of my bones and of my flesh; and he was with him a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. month of days.  </span>  full month.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  015" id="29  015" >15</span>

 Now Laban had two daughters, the name of the elder was Lea, and the name of the younger, Rachel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  017" id="29  017" >17</span>
 And the eyes of Lea were weak. But Rachel was beautiful in appearance, and exceedingly fair in countenance.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  018" id="29  018" >18</span>
 And Jacob loved Rachel, and said, I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  019" id="29  019" >19</span>
 And Laban said to him,   It is   better that I should give her to you, than that I should give her to another man; dwell with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  020" id="29  020" >20</span>
 And Jacob served for Rachel seven years, and they were before him as a few days, by reason of his loving her.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  021" id="29  021" >21</span>
 And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  022" id="29  022" >22</span>
 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a marriage-feast.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  023" id="29  023" >23</span>
 And it was even, and he took his daughter Lea, and brought her in to Jacob, and Jacob went in to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  024" id="29  024" >24</span>
 And Laban gave to his daughter Lea, Zelpha his handmaid, as a handmaid for her.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  025" id="29  025" >25</span>
 And it was morning, and behold it was Lea; and Jacob said to Laban, What is this that you have done to me? did I not serve you for Rachel? and therefore have you deceived me?  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  026" id="29  026" >26</span>
 And Laban answered, It is not done thus in our country, to give the younger before the elder.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  027" id="29  027" >27</span>
 Fulfil then her sevens, and I will give to you her also in return for your labor, which you labor with me, yet seven other years.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  028" id="29  028" >28</span>
 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her sevens; and Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  029" id="29  029" >29</span>
 And Laban gave to his daughter his handmaid Balla, for a handmaid to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  030" id="29  030" >30</span>
 And he went in to Rachel; and he loved Rachel more than Lea; and he served him seven other years.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  031" id="29  031" >31</span>
 And when the Lord God saw that Lea was hated, he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  032" id="29  032" >32</span>
 And Lea conceived and bore a son to Jacob; and she called his name, Ruben; saying, Because the Lord has looked on my humiliation, and has given me a son, now then my husband will love me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  033" id="29  033" >33</span>
 And she conceived again, and bore a second son to Jacob; and she said, Because the Lord has heard that I am hated, he has given to me this one also; and she called his name, Simeon.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  034" id="29  034" >34</span>
 And she conceived yet again, and bore a son, and said, In the present time my husband will be with me, for I have born him three sons; therefore she called his name, Levi.  <span class="verse" rel="v00129  035" id="29  035" >35</span>
 And having conceived yet again, she bore a son, and said, Now yet again this time will I give thanks to the Lord; therefore she called his name, Juda; and ceased bearing.

<p><span class="chapter" id="30  001">30  </span> And Rachel having perceived that she bore Jacob no children, was jealous of her sister; and said to Jacob, Give me children; and if not, I shall die.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  002" id="30  002" >2</span>
 And Jacob was angry with Rachel, and said to her, Am I in the place of God, who has deprived you of the fruit of the womb?  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  003" id="30  003" >3</span>
 And Rachel said to Jacob, Behold my handmaid Balla, go in to her, and she shall bear upon my knees, and I also shall have children by her.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  004" id="30  004" >4</span>
 And she gave him Balla her maid, for a wife to him; and Jacob went in to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  005" id="30  005" >5</span>
 And Balla, Rachel's maid, conceived, and bore Jacob a son.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  006" id="30  006" >6</span>
 And Rachel said, God has given judgment for me, and listened to my voice, and has given me a son; therefore she called his name, Dan.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  007" id="30  007" >7</span>
 And Balla, Rachel's maid, conceived yet again, and bore a second son to Jacob.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  008" id="30  008" >8</span>
 And Rachel said, God has helped me, and I contended with my sister and prevailed; and she called his name, Nephthalim.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  009" id="30  009" >9</span>
 And Lea saw that she ceased from bearing, and she took Zelpha her maid, and gave her to Jacob for a wife; and he went in to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  010" id="30  010" >10</span>
 And Zelpha the maid of Lea conceived, and bore Jacob a son.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  011" id="30  011" >11</span>
 And Lea said,   It is   happily: and she called his name, Gad.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  012" id="30  012" >12</span>
 And Zelpha the maid of Lea conceived yet again, and bore Jacob a second son.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  013" id="30  013" >13</span>
 And Lea said, I am blessed, for the women will pronounce me blessed; and she called his name, Aser.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  014" id="30  014" >14</span>
 And Ruben went in the day of barley harvest, and found apples of mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Lea; and Rachel said to Lea her sister, Give me of your son's mandrakes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  015" id="30  015" >15</span>
 And Lea said,   Is it   not enough for you that you have taken my husband, will you also take my son's mandrakes? And Rachel said, Not so: let him lie with you tonight for your son's mandrakes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  016" id="30  016" >16</span>
 And Jacob came in out of the field at even; and Lea went forth to meet him, and said, You shall come in to me this day, for I have hired you for my son's mandrakes; and he lay with her that night.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  017" id="30  017" >17</span>
 And God listened to Lea, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  018" id="30  018" >18</span>
 And Lea said, God has given me my reward, because I gave my maid to my husband; and she called his name Issachar, which is, Reward.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  019" id="30  019" >19</span>
 And Lea conceived again, and bore Jacob a sixth son.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  020" id="30  020" >20</span>
 And Lea said, God has given me a good gift in this time; my husband will choose me, for I have born him six sons: and she called his name, Zabulon.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  021" id="30  021" >21</span>
 And after this she bore a daughter; and she called her name, Dina.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  022" id="30  022" >22</span>
 And God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and he opened her womb.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  023" id="30  023" >23</span>
 And she conceived, and bore Jacob a son; and Rachel said, God has taken away my reproach.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  024" id="30  024" >24</span>
 And she called his name Joseph, saying, Let God add to me another son.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  025" id="30  025" >25</span>
 And it came to pass when Rachel had born Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my place and to my land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  026" id="30  026" >26</span>
 Restore my wives and my children, for whom I have served you, that I may depart, for you know the service wherewith I have served you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  027" id="30  027" >27</span>
 And Laban said to him, If I have found grace in your sight,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Stay you, perhaps understood. Heb. I have argued that, etc.  </span>  I would augur   well  , for the Lord has blessed me at your coming in.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  028" id="30  028" >28</span>
 Appoint  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit. your wages to or with me.  </span>  me your wages, and I will give   them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  029" id="30  029" >29</span>
 And Jacob said, You know in what things I have served you, and how many cattle of your are with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  030" id="30  030" >30</span>
 For it was little you had before my time, and it is increased to a multitude, and the Lord God has blessed you  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        So A.V. but Gr. and Heb. literally, at my foot.  </span>  since my coming; now then, when shall I set up also my own house?  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  031" id="30  031" >31</span>
 And Laban said to him, What shall I give you? and Jacob said to him, You shall not give me anything; if you will do this thing for me, I will again tend your flocks and keep them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  032" id="30  032" >32</span>
 Let all your sheep pass by today, and separate thence every grey sheep among the rams, and every one that is speckled and spotted among the goats—  this   shall be my reward.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  033" id="30  033" >33</span>
 And my righteousness shall  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Listen to or obey me.  </span>  answer for me on the morrow, for it is my reward before you: whatever shall not be spotted and speckled among the goats, and grey among the rams, shall be stolen with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  034" id="30  034" >34</span>
 And Laban said to him, Let it be according to your word.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  035" id="30  035" >35</span>
 And he separated in that day the spotted and speckled he-goats, and all the spotted and speckled she-goats, and all that was grey among the rams, and every one that was white among them, and he gave them into the hand of his sons.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  036" id="30  036" >36</span>
 And he set a distance of a three days' journey between them  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. and between. Hebraism.  </span>  and Jacob. And Jacob tended the cattle of Laban that were left behind.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  037" id="30  037" >37</span>
 And Jacob took to himself green rods of storax tree and walnut and plane tree; and Jacob peeled in them white stripes; and as  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Apparently the nom. absol.  </span>  he drew off the green, the white stripe which he had made appeared alternate on the rods.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  038" id="30  038" >38</span>
 And he laid the rods which he had peeled, in the hollows of the watering-troughs, that whenever the cattle should come to drink, as they should have come to drink before the rods, the cattle might conceive at the rods.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  039" id="30  039" >39</span>
 So the cattle conceived at the rods, and the cattle brought forth   young   speckled, and streaked and spotted with ash-colored   spots  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  040" id="30  040" >40</span>
 And Jacob separated the lambs, and set before the sheep a speckled ram, and every variegated one among the lambs, and he separated flocks for himself alone, and did not mingle them with the sheep of Laban.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  041" id="30  041" >41</span>
 And it came to pass in the time wherein the cattle became pregnant, conceiving in the belly, Jacob put the rods before the cattle in the troughs, that they might conceive by the rods.  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The meaning of the Hebrew seems to be, when the cattle were weak from any cause. The LXX. by assigning the yeaning time as the cause, have obscured the passage. Of course Jacob would not put them in then.  </span>   <span class="verse" rel="v00130  042" id="30  042" >42</span>
 But he did not put them in   indiscriminately   whenever the cattle happened to bring forth, but the unmarked ones were Laban's, and the marked ones were Jacob's.  <span class="verse" rel="v00130  043" id="30  043" >43</span>
 And the man became very rich, and he had many cattle, and oxen, and servants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.

<p><span class="chapter" id="31  001">31  </span> And Jacob heard the words of the sons of Laban, saying, Jacob has taken all that was our father's, and of our father's property has he gotten all this glory.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  002" id="31  002" >2</span>
 And Jacob saw the countenance of Laban, and behold it was not toward him as  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. yesterday and the day before. Hebraism.  </span>  before.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  003" id="31  003" >3</span>
 And the Lord said to Jacob, Return to the land of your father, and to your family, and I will be with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  004" id="31  004" >4</span>
 And Jacob sent and called Lea and Rachel to the plain where the flocks were.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  005" id="31  005" >5</span>
 And he said to them, I see the face of your father, that it is not toward me as before, but the God of my father was with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  006" id="31  006" >6</span>
 And you° too know that with all my might I have served your father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  007" id="31  007" >7</span>
 But your father deceived me, and changed my wages for the ten lambs, yet God gave him not   power   to hurt me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  008" id="31  008" >8</span>
 If he should say thus, The speckled shall be your reward, then all the cattle would bear speckled; and if he should say, The white shall be your reward, then would all the cattle bear white.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  009" id="31  009" >9</span>
 So God has taken away all the cattle of your father, and given them to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  010" id="31  010" >10</span>
 And it came to pass when the cattle conceived and were with young, that I [*]saw with my eyes in sleep, and behold the he-goats and the rams leaping on the sheep and the she-goats, speckled and variegated and spotted with ash-colored spots.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  011" id="31  011" >11</span>
 And the angel of God said to me  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit. in sleep.  </span>  in a dream, Jacob; and I said, What is it?  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  012" id="31  012" >12</span>
 And he said, Look up with your eyes, and behold the he-goats and the rams leaping on the sheep and the she-goats, speckled and variegated and spotted with ash-colored spots; for I have seen all things that Laban does to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  013" id="31  013" >13</span>
 I am God that appeared to you in the place of God where you anointed a pillar to me, and vowed to me there a vow; now then arise and depart out of this land, depart into the land of your nativity, and I will be with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  014" id="31  014" >14</span>
 And Rachel and Lea answered and said to him, Have we yet a part or inheritance in the house of our father?  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  015" id="31  015" >15</span>
 Are we not considered strangers by him? for he has sold us, and quite devoured our money.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  016" id="31  016" >16</span>
 All the wealth and the glory which God has taken from our father, it shall be our's and our children's; now then do whatever God has said to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  017" id="31  017" >17</span>
 And Jacob arose and took his wives and his children up on the camels;  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  018" id="31  018" >18</span>
 and he took away all his possessions and all his store, which he had gotten in Mesopotamia, and all that belonged to him, to depart to Isaac his father in the land of Chanaan.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  019" id="31  019" >19</span>
 And Laban went to shear his sheep; and Rachel stole her father's images.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  020" id="31  020" >20</span>
 And Jacob hid   the matter from   Laban the Syrian, so as not to tell him that he ran away.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  021" id="31  021" >21</span>
 And he departed himself and all that belonged to him, and passed over the river, and went into the mountain Galaad.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  022" id="31  022" >22</span>
 But it was told Laban the Syrian on the third day, that Jacob was fled.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  023" id="31  023" >23</span>
 And having taken his brethren with him, he pursued after him seven days' journey, and overtook him on Mount Galaad.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  024" id="31  024" >24</span>
 And God came to Laban the Syrian in sleep by night, and said to him, Take heed to yourself that you speak not at any time to Jacob evil things.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  025" id="31  025" >25</span>
 And Laban overtook Jacob; and Jacob pitched his tent in the mountain; and Laban stationed his brothers in the mount Galaad.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  026" id="31  026" >26</span>
 And Laban said to Jacob, What have you done? therefore did you run away secretly, and pillage me, and lead away my daughters as captives taken with the sword?  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  027" id="31  027" >27</span>
 Whereas if you had told me, I would have sent you away with mirth, and with songs, and timbrels, and harp.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  028" id="31  028" >28</span>
 And I was not counted worthy to embrace my children and my daughters; now then you have wrought foolishly.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  029" id="31  029" >29</span>
 And now my hand has power to hurt you; but the God of your father spoke to me yesterday, saying, Take heed to yourself that you speak not evil words to Jacob.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  030" id="31  030" >30</span>
 Now then go on your way, for you have earnestly desired to depart to the house of your father; therefore have you stolen my gods?  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  031" id="31  031" >31</span>
 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid; for I said, Lest at any time you should take away your daughters from me, and all my possessions.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  032" id="31  032" >32</span>
 And Jacob said, With whoever you shall find your gods, he shall not live in the presence of our brethren; take notice of what I have of your property, and take it; and he observed nothing with him, but Jacob knew not that his wife Rachel had stolen them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  033" id="31  033" >33</span>
 And Laban went in and searched in the house of Lea, and found   them   not; and he went out of the house of Lea, and searched in the house of Jacob, and in the house of the two maidservants, and found them not; and he went also into the house of Rachel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  034" id="31  034" >34</span>
 And Rachel took the idols, and cast them among the camel's packs, and sat upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  035" id="31  035" >35</span>
 And she said to her father, Be not indignant, Sir; I can’t rise up before you, for it is with me according to the manner of women. Laban searched in all the house, and found not the images.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  036" id="31  036" >36</span>
 And Jacob was angry, and strove with Laban; and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my injustice, and what my sin, that you have pursued after me,  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  037" id="31  037" >37</span>
 and that you have searched all the furniture of my house? what have you found of all the furniture of your house? set it here between your relations and my relations, and let them decide between us two.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  038" id="31  038" >38</span>
 These twenty years have I been with you; your sheep, and your she-goats have not failed in bearing; I devoured not the rams of your cattle.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  039" id="31  039" >39</span>
 That which was taken of beasts I brought not to you; I made good of myself the thefts of the day, and the thefts of the night.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  040" id="31  040" >40</span>
 I was parched with heat by day, and   chilled   with frost by night, and my sleep departed from my eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  041" id="31  041" >41</span>
 These twenty years have I been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years among your sheep, and you did falsely rate my wages for ten lambs.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  042" id="31  042" >42</span>
 Unless I had the God of my father Abraam, and the fear of Isaac, now you would have sent me away empty; God saw my humiliation, and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you yesterday.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  043" id="31  043" >43</span>
 And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the sons my sons, and the cattle are my cattle, and all things which you see are mine, and   the property   of my daughters; what shall I do to them today, or their children which they bore?  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  044" id="31  044" >44</span>
 Now then come, let me make a covenant, both I and you, and it shall be for a witness between me and you; and he said to him, Behold, there is no one with us; behold, God is witness between me and you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  045" id="31  045" >45</span>
 And Jacob having taken a stone, set it up for a pillar.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  046" id="31  046" >46</span>
 And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones; and they gathered stones and made a heap, and ate there upon the heap; and Laban said to him, This heap witnesses between me and you today.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  047" id="31  047" >47</span>
 And Laban called it, the Heap of Testimony; and Jacob called it, the Witness Heap.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  048" id="31  048" >48</span>
 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and the pillar, which I have set between me and you; this heap witnesses, and this pillar witnesses; therefore its name was called, the Heap witnesses.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  049" id="31  049" >49</span>
 And the vision of which he said—Let God look to it between me and you, because we are about to depart from each other, —  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  050" id="31  050" >50</span>
 If you shall humble my daughters, if you should take wives in addition to my daughters, see, there is no one with us looking on. God   is   witness between me and you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  50a" id="31  50a" >50a</span>
 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold, this heap, and this pillar are a witness.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  052" id="31  052" >52</span>
 For if I should not cross over to you, neither should you cross over to me, for mischief beyond this heap and this pillar.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  053" id="31  053" >53</span>
 The God of Abraam and the God of Nachor judge between us; and Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.  <span class="verse" rel="v00131  054" id="31  054" >54</span>
 And he offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren, and they ate and drank, and slept in the mountain.

 And Jacob departed for his journey; and having looked up, he saw the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. camp  </span>  host of God encamped; and the angels of God met him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  003" id="32  003" >3</span>
 And Jacob said, when he saw them, This is the Camp of God; and he called the name of that place, Encampments.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  004" id="32  004" >4</span>
 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, to the country of Edom.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  005" id="32  005" >5</span>
 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall you° say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob; I have sojourned with Laban and tarried until now.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  006" id="32  006" >6</span>
 And there were born to me oxen, and asses, and sheep, and menservants and women-servants; and I sent to tell my lord Esau, that your servant might find grace in your sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  007" id="32  007" >7</span>
 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and behold! he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  008" id="32  008" >8</span>
 And Jacob was greatly terrified, and was perplexed; and he divided the people that was with him, and the cows, and the camels, and the sheep, into two camps.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  009" id="32  009" >9</span>
 And Jacob said, If Esau should come to one camp, and strike it, the other camp shall be in safety.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  010" id="32  010" >10</span>
 And Jacob said, God of my father Abraam, and God of my father Isaac, O Lord, you   are   he that said to me, Depart quickly to the land of your birth, and I will do you good.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  011" id="32  011" >11</span>
 Let there be to me a sufficiency of all the justice and all the truth which you have wrought with your servant; for with this my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two camps.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  012" id="32  012" >12</span>
 Deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I am afraid of him, lest haply he should come and strike me, and the mother upon the children.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  013" id="32  013" >13</span>
 But you said, I will do you good, and will make your seed as the sand of the sea, which shall not be numbered for multitude.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  014" id="32  014" >14</span>
 And he slept there that night, and took of the gifts which he carried   with him  , and sent out to Esau his brother,  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  015" id="32  015" >15</span>
 two hundred she-goats, twenty he-goats, two hundred sheep, twenty rams,  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  016" id="32  016" >16</span>
 milch camels, and their foals, thirty, forty kine, ten bulls, twenty asses, and ten colts.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  017" id="32  017" >17</span>
 And he gave them to his servants   each   drove apart; and he said to his servants, Go on before me, and put a space between drove and drove.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  018" id="32  018" >18</span>
 And he charged the first, saying, If Esau my brother meet you, and he ask you, saying, Whose are you? and whither would you go, and whose are these possessions advancing before you?  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  019" id="32  019" >19</span>
 You shall say, Your servant Jacob's; he has sent gifts to my lord Esau, and behold! he is behind us.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  020" id="32  020" >20</span>
 And he charged the first and the second and the third, and all that went before him after these flocks, saying, Thus shall you° speak to Esau when you° find him;  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  021" id="32  021" >21</span>
 and you° shall say, Behold your servant Jacob comes after us. For he said, I will propitiate his countenance with the gifts going before his presence, and afterwards I will behold his face, for perhaps he will accept  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. my face.  </span>  me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  022" id="32  022" >22</span>
 So the presents went on before him, but he himself lodged that night in the camp.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  023" id="32  023" >23</span>
 And he rose up in that night, and took his two wives and his two servant-maids, and his eleven children, and crossed over the ford of Jaboch.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  024" id="32  024" >24</span>
 And he took them, and passed over the torrent, and brought over all his possessions.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  025" id="32  025" >25</span>
 And Jacob was left alone; and a man wrestled with him till the morning.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  026" id="32  026" >26</span>
 And he saw that he prevailed not against him; and he touched the broad part of his thigh, and the broad part of Jacob's thigh was benumbed in his wrestling with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  027" id="32  027" >27</span>
 And he said to him, Let me go, for the day has dawned; but he said, I will not let you go, except you bless me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  028" id="32  028" >28</span>
 And he said to him, What is your name? and he answered, Jacob.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  029" id="32  029" >29</span>
 And he said to him, Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name; for you have prevailed with God, and shall be mighty with men.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  030" id="32  030" >30</span>
 And Jacob asked and said, Tell me your name; and he said, Therefore do you ask after my name? and he blessed him there.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  031" id="32  031" >31</span>
 And Jacob called the name of that place, the Face of God; for,   said he,   I have seen God face to face, and my life was preserved.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  032" id="32  032" >32</span>
 And the sun rose upon him, when he passed the Face of God; and he halted upon his thigh.  <span class="verse" rel="v00132  033" id="32  033" >33</span>
 Therefore the children of Israel will by no means eat of the sinew which was benumbed, which is on the broad part of the thigh, until this day, because   the angel   touched the broad part of the thigh of Jacob—  even   the sinew which was benumbed.

 And he put the two handmaidens and their children with the first, and Lea and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph last.  <span class="verse" rel="v00133  003" id="33  003" >3</span>
 But he advanced himself before them, and did reverence to the ground seven times, until he drew near to his brother.  <span class="verse" rel="v00133  004" id="33  004" >4</span>
 And Esau ran on to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him; and they both wept.  <span class="verse" rel="v00133  005" id="33  005" >5</span>
 And Esau looked up and saw the women and the children, and said, What are these to you? And he said, The children with which God has mercifully blessed your servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v00133  006" id="33  006" >6</span>
 And the maidservants and their children drew near and did reverence.  <span class="verse" rel="v00133  007" id="33  007" >7</span>
 And Lea and her children drew near and did reverence; and after this drew near Rachel and Joseph, and did reverence.  <span class="verse" rel="v00133  008" id="33  008" >8</span>
 And he said, What are these things to you, all these companies that I have met? And he said, That your servant might find grace in your sight, my lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00133  009" id="33  009" >9</span>
 And Esau said, I have much, my brother; keep your own.  <span class="verse" rel="v00133  010" id="33  010" >10</span>
 And Jacob said, If I have found grace in your sight, receive the gifts through my hands; therefore have I seen your face, as if any one should see the face of God, and you shall be well-pleased with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00133  011" id="33  011" >11</span>
 Receive my blessings, which I have brought you, because God has had mercy on me, and I have all things; and he constrained him, and he took   them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00133  012" id="33  012" >12</span>
 And he said, Let us depart, and proceed right onward.  <span class="verse" rel="v00133  013" id="33  013" >13</span>
 And he said to him, My lord knows, that the children are very tender, and the flocks and the herds with me are with young; if then I shall drive them hard one day, all the cattle will die.  <span class="verse" rel="v00133  014" id="33  014" >14</span>
 Let my lord go on before his servant, and I shall have strength on the road according to the ease of the journey before me, and according to the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. foot.  </span>  strength of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir.  <span class="verse" rel="v00133  015" id="33  015" >15</span>
 And Esau said, I will leave with you some of the people who are with me. And he said, Why so? it is enough that I have found favor before you,   my   lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00133  016" id="33  016" >16</span>
 And Esau returned on that day on his journey to Seir.  <span class="verse" rel="v00133  017" id="33  017" >17</span>
 And Jacob departs to his tents; and he made for himself there habitations, and for his cattle he made booths; therefore he called the name of that place, Booths.  <span class="verse" rel="v00133  018" id="33  018" >18</span>
 And Jacob came to Salem, a city of Secima, which is in the land of Chanaan, when he departed out of Mesopotamia of Syria, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, pitched his tent.

<p><span class="chapter" id="34  001">34  </span> And Dina, the daughter of Lea, whom she bore to Jacob, went forth to observe the daughters of the inhabitants.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  002" id="34  002" >2</span>
 And Sychem the son of Emmor the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex. the chorrhæan.  </span>  Evite, the ruler of the land, saw her, and took her and lay with her, and humbled her.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  003" id="34  003" >3</span>
 And he was attached to the soul of Dina the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and he spoke  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit. spoke according to the heart of the damsel — to her. A literal version of the Hebrew.  </span>  kindly to the damsel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  004" id="34  004" >4</span>
 Sychem spoke to Emmor his father, saying, Take for me this damsel to wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  005" id="34  005" >5</span>
 And Jacob heard that the son of Emmor had defiled Dina his daughter (now his sons were with his cattle in the plain). And Jacob was silent until they came.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  006" id="34  006" >6</span>
 And Emmor the father of Sychem went forth to Jacob, to speak to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  007" id="34  007" >7</span>
 And the sons of Jacob came from the plain; and when they heard, the men were deeply pained, and it was very grievous to them, because   the man   wrought folly in Israel, having lain with the daughter of Jacob, and so it  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit. shall not be.  </span>  must not be.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  008" id="34  008" >8</span>
 And Emmor spoke to them, saying, Sychem my son has chosen in his heart your daughter; give her therefore to him for a wife,  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  009" id="34  009" >9</span>
 and intermarry with us. Give us your daughters, and take our daughters for your sons.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  010" id="34  010" >10</span>
 And dwell in the midst of us; and, behold, the land is spacious before you, dwell in it, and trade, and get possessions in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  011" id="34  011" >11</span>
 And Sychem said to her father and to her brothers, I would find grace before you, and we will give whatever you° shall name.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  012" id="34  012" >12</span>
 Multiply   your demand of   dowry very much, and I will give accordingly as you° shall say to me, only you° shall give me this damsel for a wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  013" id="34  013" >13</span>
 And the sons of Jacob answered to Sychem and Emmor his father craftily, and spoke to them, because they had defiled Dina their sister.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  014" id="34  014" >14</span>
 And Symeon and Levi, the brothers of Dina, said to them, We shall not be able to do this thing, to give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised, for it is a reproach to us.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  015" id="34  015" >15</span>
 Only on these terms will we conform to you, and dwell among you, if you° also will be as we are, in that every male of you be circumcised.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  016" id="34  016" >16</span>
 And we will give our daughters to you, and we will take of your daughters for wives to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will be as one race.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  017" id="34  017" >17</span>
 But if you° will not listen to us to be circumcised, we will take our daughter and depart.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  018" id="34  018" >18</span>
 And the words pleased Emmor, and Sychem the son of Emmor.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  019" id="34  019" >19</span>
 And the young man delayed not to do this  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. word.  </span>  thing, for he was much attached to Jacob's daughter, and he was the most honorable of all in his father's house.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  020" id="34  020" >20</span>
 And Emmor and Sychem his son came to the gate of their city, and spoke to the men of their city, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  021" id="34  021" >21</span>
 These men are peaceful, let them dwell with us upon the land, and let them trade in it, and behold the land is extensive before them; we will take their daughters to us for wives, and we will give them our daughters.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  022" id="34  022" >22</span>
 Only on these terms will the men conform to us to dwell with us so as to be one people, if every male of us be circumcised, as they also are circumcised.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  023" id="34  023" >23</span>
 And shall not their cattle and their  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. quadrupeds.  </span>  herds, and their possessions, be ours? only in this let us conform to them, and they will dwell with us.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  024" id="34  024" >24</span>
 And all that went in at the gate of their city listened to Emmor and Sychem his son, and they were circumcised in the flesh of their foreskin every male.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  025" id="34  025" >25</span>
 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain, the two sons of Jacob, Symeon and Levi, Dina's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city securely, and killed every male.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  026" id="34  026" >26</span>
 And they killed Emmor and Sychem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dina out of the house of Sychem, and went forth.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  027" id="34  027" >27</span>
 But the sons of Jacob came upon the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, slain, which seems frequently the sense in LXX.  </span>  wounded, and ravaged the city wherein they had defiled Dina their sister.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  028" id="34  028" >28</span>
 And their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses they took, and all things whatever were in the city, and whatever were in the plain.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  029" id="34  029" >29</span>
 And they took captive all the persons of them, and all their store, and their wives, and plundered both whatever things there were in the city, and whatever things there were in the houses.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  030" id="34  030" >30</span>
 And Jacob said to Symeon and Levi, You° have made me hateful so that I should be evil to all the inhabitants of the land, both among the Chananites and the Pherezites, and I am few in number; they will gather themselves against me and cut me in pieces, and I shall be utterly destroyed, and my house.  <span class="verse" rel="v00134  031" id="34  031" >31</span>
 And they said, Nay, but shall they treat our sister as an harlot?

<p><span class="chapter" id="35  001">35  </span> And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to the place, Baethel, and dwell there; and make there an altar to the God that appeared to you, when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.  <span class="verse" rel="v00135  002" id="35  002" >2</span>
 And Jacob said to his house, and to all that were with him, Remove the strange gods that are with you from the midst of you, and purify yourselves, and change your clothes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00135  003" id="35  003" >3</span>
 And let us rise and go up to Baethel, and let us there make an altar to God who listened to me in the day of calamity, who was with me, and preserved me throughout in the journey, by which I went.  <span class="verse" rel="v00135  004" id="35  004" >4</span>
 And they gave to Jacob the strange gods, which were in their hands, and the ear-rings which were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the turpentine tree which is in Secima, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, lost.  </span>  destroyed them to this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00135  005" id="35  005" >5</span>
 So Israel departed from Secima, and the fear of God was upon the cities round about them, and they did not pursue after the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00135  006" id="35  006" >6</span>
 And Jacob came to Luza, which is in the land of Chanaan, which is Baethel, he and all the people that were with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00135  007" id="35  007" >7</span>
 And he built there an altar, and called the name of the place Baethel; for there God appeared to him, when he fled from the face of his brother Esau.  <span class="verse" rel="v00135  008" id="35  008" >8</span>
 And Deborrha, Rebecca's nurse, died, and was buried below Baethel under the oak; and Jacob called its name, The Oak of Mourning.  <span class="verse" rel="v00135  009" id="35  009" >9</span>
 And God appeared to Jacob once more in Luza, when he came out of Mesopotamia of Syria, and God blessed him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00135  010" id="35  010" >10</span>
 And God said to him, Your name shall not be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name; and he called his name Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00135  011" id="35  011" >11</span>
 And God said to him, I am your God; increase and multiply; for nations and gatherings of nations shall be of you, and kings shall come out of your loins.  <span class="verse" rel="v00135  012" id="35  012" >12</span>
 And the land which I gave to Abraam and Isaac, I have given it to you; and it shall come to pass that I will give this land also to your seed after you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00135  013" id="35  013" >13</span>
 And God went up from him from the place where he spoke with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00135  014" id="35  014" >14</span>
 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where God spoke with him,   even   a pillar of stone; and offered a libation upon it, and poured oil upon it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00135  015" id="35  015" >15</span>
 And Jacob called the name of the place in which God spoke with him, Baethel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00135  016" id="35  016" >16</span>

 And these are the generations of Jacob. And Joseph was seventeen years old, feeding the sheep of his father with his brethren, being young; with the sons of Balla, and with the sons of Zelpha, the wives of his father;  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, according to some copies, they brought an evil report of Joseph, etc.  </span>  and Joseph brought to Israel their father their evil reproach.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  003" id="37  003" >3</span>
 And Jacob loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was to him the son of old age; and he made for him a coat of many colors.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  004" id="37  004" >4</span>
 And his brethren having seen that his father loved him more than all his sons, hated him, and could not speak anything peaceful to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  005" id="37  005" >5</span>
 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and reported it to his brethren.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  006" id="37  006" >6</span>
 And he said to them, Hear this dream which I have dreamed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  007" id="37  007" >7</span>
 I thought you° were binding sheaves in the middle of the field, and my sheaf stood up and was erected, and your sheaves turned round, and did obeisance to my sheaf.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  008" id="37  008" >8</span>
 And his brethren said to him, Shall you indeed reign over us, or shall you indeed be lord over us? And they hated him still more for his dreams and for his words.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  009" id="37  009" >9</span>
 And he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. saw.  </span>  dreamed another dream, and related it to his father, and to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed another dream: as it were the sun, and the moon, and the eleven stars did me reverence.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  010" id="37  010" >10</span>
 And his father rebuked him, and said to him, What is this dream which you have dreamed? shall indeed both I and your mother and your brethren come and bow before you to the earth?  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  011" id="37  011" >11</span>
 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  012" id="37  012" >12</span>
 And his brethren went to feed the sheep of their father to Sychem.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  013" id="37  013" >13</span>
 And Israel said to Joseph, Do not your brethren feed their flock in Sychem? Come, I will send you to them; and he said to him, Behold, I   am here  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  014" id="37  014" >14</span>
 And Israel said to him, Go and see if your brethren and the sheep are well, and bring me word; and he sent him out of the valley of Chebron, and he came to Sychem.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  015" id="37  015" >15</span>
 And a man found him wandering in the field; and the man asked him, saying, What seek you?  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  016" id="37  016" >16</span>
 And he said, I am seeking my brethren; tell me where they feed   their flocks  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  017" id="37  017" >17</span>
 And the man said to him, They have departed hence, for I heard them saying, Let us go to Dothaim; and Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothaim.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  018" id="37  018" >18</span>
 And they spied him from a distance before he drew near to them, and they wickedly took counsel to kill him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  019" id="37  019" >19</span>
 And each said to his brother, Behold, that dreamer comes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  020" id="37  020" >20</span>
 Now then come, let us kill him, and cast him into one of the pits; and we will say, An evil wild beast has devoured him; and we shall see what his dreams will be.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  021" id="37  021" >21</span>
 And Ruben having heard it, rescued him out of their hands, and said, Let us not  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. strike him to the life.  </span>  kill him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  022" id="37  022" >22</span>
 And Ruben said to them, Shed not blood; cast him into one of these pits in the wilderness, but do not lay   your   hands upon him; that he might rescue him out of their hands, and restore him to his father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  023" id="37  023" >23</span>
 And it came to pass, when Joseph came to his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his many-coloured coat that was upon him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  024" id="37  024" >24</span>
 And they took him and cast him into the pit; and the pit was empty, it had not water.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  025" id="37  025" >25</span>
 And they sat down to eat bread; and having lifted up their eyes they [*]saw, and behold, Ismaelitish travellers came from Galaad, and their camels were heavily loaded with spices, and resin, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. stacte.  </span>  myrrh; and they went to bring them to Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  026" id="37  026" >26</span>
 And Judas said to his brethren, What profit is it if we kill our brother, and conceal his blood?  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  027" id="37  027" >27</span>
 Come, let us sell him to these Ismaelites, but let not our hands be upon him, because he is our brother and our flesh; and his brethren listened.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  028" id="37  028" >28</span>
 And the men, the merchants of Madian, went by, and they drew and lifted Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ismaelites for twenty pieces of gold; and they brought Joseph down into Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  029" id="37  029" >29</span>
 And Ruben returned to the pit, and sees not Joseph in the pit; and he tore his garments.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  030" id="37  030" >30</span>
 And he returned to his brethren and said, The boy is not; and I, whither am I yet to go?  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  031" id="37  031" >31</span>
 And having taken the coat of Joseph, they killed a kid of the goats, and stained the coat with the blood.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  032" id="37  032" >32</span>
 And they sent the coat of many colors; and they brought it to their father, and said, This have we found; know if it be your son's coat or no. And he recognized it, and said, It is my son's coat, an evil wild beast has devoured him; a wild beast has carried off Joseph.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  033" id="37  033" >33</span>
 And Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  034" id="37  034" >34</span>
 And all his sons and his daughters gathered themselves together, and came to comfort him; but he would not be comforted, saying, I will go down to my son mourning to Hades; and his father wept for him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  035" id="37  035" >35</span>
 And the Madianites sold Joseph into Egypt; to Petephres, the eunuch of Pharao, captain of the guard.  <span class="verse" rel="v00137  036" id="37  036" >36</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="38  001">38  </span> And it came to pass at that time that Judas went down from his brethren, and came as far as to a certain man of Odollam, whose name was Iras.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  002" id="38  002" >2</span>
 And Judas saw there the daughter of a Chananitish man, whose name was Sava; and he took her, and went in to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  003" id="38  003" >3</span>
 And she conceived and bore a son, and called his name, Er.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  004" id="38  004" >4</span>
 And she conceived and bore a son again; and called his name, Aunan.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  005" id="38  005" >5</span>
 And she again bore a son; and called his name, Selom: and she was in Chasbi when she bore them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  006" id="38  006" >6</span>
 And Judas took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Thamar.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  007" id="38  007" >7</span>
 And Er, the firstborn of Judas, was wicked before the Lord; and God killed him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  008" id="38  008" >8</span>
 And Judas said to Aunan, Go in to your brother's wife, and marry her as her brother-in-law, and raise up seed to your brother.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  009" id="38  009" >9</span>
 And Aunan, knowing that the seed should not be his—it came to pass when he went in to his brother's wife, that he spilled   it   upon the ground, so that he should not give seed to his brother's wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  010" id="38  010" >10</span>
 And his doing this appeared evil before God; and he killed him also.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  011" id="38  011" >11</span>
 And Judas said to Thamar, his daughter-in-law, Sit you a widow in the house of your father-in-law, until Selom my son be grown; for he said, lest he also die as his brethren; and Thamar departed, and sat in the house of her father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  012" id="38  012" >12</span>
 And the days were fulfilled, and Sava the wife of Judas died; and Judas, being comforted, went to them that sheared his sheep, himself and Iras his Shepherd the Odollamite, to Thamna.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  013" id="38  013" >13</span>
 And it was told Thamar his daughter-in-law, saying, Behold, your father-in-law goes up to Thamna, to shear his sheep.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  014" id="38  014" >14</span>
 And having taken off the garments of her widowhood from her, she put on a veil, and ornamented her face, and sat by the gates of Aenan, which is in the way to Thamna, for she saw that Selom was grown; but he gave her not to him for a wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  015" id="38  015" >15</span>
 And when Judas saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; for she covered her face, and he knew her not.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  016" id="38  016" >16</span>
 And he went out of his way to her, and said to her, Let me come in to you; for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law; and she said, What will you give me if you should come in to me?  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  017" id="38  017" >17</span>
 And he said, I will send you a kid of the goats from my flock; and she said,   Well  , if you will give me an earnest, until you send it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  018" id="38  018" >18</span>
 And he said, What is the earnest that I shall give you? and she said, Your ring, and your bracelet, and the staff in your hand; and he gave them to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  019" id="38  019" >19</span>
 And she arose and departed, and took her veil from off her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  020" id="38  020" >20</span>
 And Judas sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his shepherd the Odollamite, to receive the pledge from the woman; and he found her not.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  021" id="38  021" >21</span>
 And he asked the men of the place, Where is the harlot who was in Aenan by the wayside? and they said, There was no harlot here.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  022" id="38  022" >22</span>
 And he returned to Judas, and said, I have not found her; and the men of the place say, There is no harlot here.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  023" id="38  023" >23</span>
 And Judas said, Let her have them, but let us not be ridiculed; I sent this kid, but you have not found her.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  024" id="38  024" >24</span>
 And it came to pass after three months, that it was told Judas, saying, Thamar your daughter-in-law has grievously played the harlot, and behold she is with child by whoredom; and Judas said, Bring her out, and let her be burnt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  025" id="38  025" >25</span>
 And as they were bringing her, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, I am with child by the man whose these things are; and she said, See whose is this ring and bracelet and staff.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  026" id="38  026" >26</span>
 And Judas knew   them  , and said, Thamar is cleared rather than I, forasmuch as I gave her not to Selom my son: and he knew her not again.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  027" id="38  027" >27</span>
 And it came to pass when she was in labor, that she also had twins in her womb.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  028" id="38  028" >28</span>
 And it came to pass as she was bringing forth, one thrust forth his hand, and the midwife having taken hold of it, bound upon his hand a scarlet   thread  , saying, This one shall come out first.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  029" id="38  029" >29</span>
 And when he drew back his hand, then immediately came forth his brother; and she said, Why has the barrier been cut through because of you? and she called his name, Phares.  <span class="verse" rel="v00138  030" id="38  030" >30</span>
 And after this came forth his brother, on whose hand was the scarlet thread; and she called his name, Zara.

<p><span class="chapter" id="39  001">39  </span> And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Petephres the eunuch of Pharao, the <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. chief cook. The same Hebrew word signifies a cook, who was also a butcher; and a guardsman, who was also an executioner.  </span>  captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ismaelites, who brought him down there.  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  002" id="39  002" >2</span>
 And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house with his lord the Egyptian.  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  003" id="39  003" >3</span>
 And his master knew that the Lord was with him, and the Lord prospers in his hands whatever he happens to do.  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  004" id="39  004" >4</span>
 And Joseph found grace in the presence of his lord, and was well-pleasing to him; and he set him over his house, and all that he had he gave into the hand of Joseph.  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  005" id="39  005" >5</span>
 And it came to pass after that he was set over his house, and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the Lord was on all his possessions in the house, and in his field.  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  006" id="39  006" >6</span>
 And he committed all that he had into the hands of Joseph; and he knew not of anything that belonged to him, save the bread which he himself ate. And Joseph was handsome in form, and exceedingly beautiful in countenance.  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  007" id="39  007" >7</span>
 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, and said, Lie with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  008" id="39  008" >8</span>
 But he would not; but said to his master's wife, If because of me my master knows nothing in his house, and has given into my hands all things that belong to him:  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  009" id="39  009" >9</span>
 and in this house there is nothing above me, nor has anything been kept back from me, but you, because you are his wife—how then shall I do this wicked thing, and sin against God?  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  010" id="39  010" >10</span>
 And when she talked with Joseph day by day, and he listened not to her to sleep with her, so as to be with her,  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  011" id="39  011" >11</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit. there happened such a day, and, etc.  </span>  it came to pass on a certain day, that Joseph went into the house to do his business, and there was no one of the household within.  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  012" id="39  012" >12</span>
 And she caught hold of him by his clothes, and said, Lie with me; and having left his clothes in her hands, he fled, and went forth.  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  013" id="39  013" >13</span>
 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his clothes in her hands, and fled, and gone forth,  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  014" id="39  014" >14</span>
 that she called those that were in the house, and spoke to them, saying, See, he has brought in to us a Hebrew servant to mock us—he came in to me, saying, Lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  015" id="39  015" >15</span>
 And when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, having left his clothes with me, he fled, and went forth out.  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  016" id="39  016" >16</span>
 So she leaves the clothes by her, until the master came to his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  017" id="39  017" >17</span>
 And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, whom you brought in to us, came in to me to mock me, and said to me, I will lie with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  018" id="39  018" >18</span>
 And when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, having left his clothes with me, he fled and departed forth.  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  019" id="39  019" >19</span>
 And it came to pass, when his master heard all the words of his wife, that she spoke to him, saying, Thus did your servant to me, that he was very angry.  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  020" id="39  020" >20</span>
 And his master took Joseph, and cast him into the prison, into the place where the king's prisoners are kept, there in the prison.  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  021" id="39  021" >21</span>
 And the Lord was with Joseph, and poured down mercy upon him; and he gave him favor in the sight of the chief keeper of the prison.  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  022" id="39  022" >22</span>
 And the chief keeper of the prison gave the prison into the hand of Joseph, and all the prisoners  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit. men led away to prison or punishment.  </span>  as many as were in the prison; and all things whatever they do there, he did them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00139  023" id="39  023" >23</span>
 Because of him the chief keeper of the prison knew nothing, for all things were in the hand of Joseph, because the Lord was with him; and whatever things he did, the Lord made them to prosper in his hands.

<p><span class="chapter" id="40  001">40  </span> And it came to pass after these things, that the chief cupbearer of the king of Egypt and the chief baker trespassed against their lord the king of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  002" id="40  002" >2</span>
 And Pharao was angry with his two eunuchs, with his chief cupbearer, and with his chief baker.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  003" id="40  003" >3</span>
 And he put them in ward, into the prison, into the place whereinto Joseph had been led.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  004" id="40  004" >4</span>
 And the chief keeper of the prison committed them to Joseph, and he stood by them; and they were   some   days in the prison.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  005" id="40  005" >5</span>
 And they both  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. saw.  </span>  had a dream in one night; and the vision of the dream of the chief cupbearer and chief baker, who belonged to the king of Egypt, who were in the prison, was this.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  006" id="40  006" >6</span>
 Joseph went in to them in the morning, and saw them, and they had been troubled.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  007" id="40  007" >7</span>
 And he asked the eunuchs of Pharao who were with him in the prison with his master, saying, Why is it that your countenances are sad today?  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  008" id="40  008" >8</span>
 And they said to him, We have seen a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, Is not the interpretation of them through god? tell   them   than to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  009" id="40  009" >9</span>
 And the chief cupbearer related his dream to Joseph, and said, In my  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. sleep.  </span>  dream a vine was before me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  010" id="40  010" >10</span>
 And in the vine   were   three stems; and it budding shot forth blossoms; the clusters of grapes were ripe.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  011" id="40  011" >11</span>
 And the cup of Pharao was in my hand; and I took the bunch of grapes, and squeezed it into the cup, and gave the cup into Pharao's hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  012" id="40  012" >12</span>
 And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it. The three stems are three days.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  013" id="40  013" >13</span>
 Yet three days and Pharao shall remember your office, and he shall restore you to your place of chief cupbearer, and you shall give the cup of Pharao into his hand, according to your former high place, as you were wont to be cupbearer.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  014" id="40  014" >14</span>
 But remember me of yourself, when it shall be well with you, and you shall deal mercifully with me, and you shall make mention of me to Pharao, and you shall bring me forth out of this dungeon.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  015" id="40  015" >15</span>
 For surely I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here I have done nothing, but they have cast me into this pit.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  016" id="40  016" >16</span>
 And the chief baker saw that he interpreted aright; and he said to Joseph, I also saw a dream, and I thought I took up on my head three baskets of mealy food.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  017" id="40  017" >17</span>
 And in the upper basket there was the work of the baker of every kind which Pharao eats; and the fowls of the air ate them out of the basket that was on my head.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  018" id="40  018" >18</span>
 And Joseph answered and said to him, This is the interpretation of it; The three baskets are three days.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  019" id="40  019" >19</span>
 Yet three days, and Pharao shall take away your head from off you, and shall hang you on a tree, and the birds of the sky shall eat your flesh from off you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  020" id="40  020" >20</span>
 And it came to pass on the third day that it was Pharao's birth-day, and he made a banquet for all his servants, and he remembered the office of the cupbearer and the office of the baker in the midst of his servants.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  021" id="40  021" >21</span>
 And he restored the chief cupbearer to his office, and he gave the cup into Pharao's hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  022" id="40  022" >22</span>
 And he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph, interpreted to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00140  023" id="40  023" >23</span>
 Yet did not the chief cupbearer remember Joseph, but forgot him.

<p><span class="chapter" id="41  001">41  </span> And it came to pass after two  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. years of days.  </span>  full years that Pharao had a dream. He thought he stood upon   the bank of   the river.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  002" id="41  002" >2</span>
 And behold, there came up as it were out of the river seven cows, fair in appearance, and choice of flesh, and they fed on the sedge.  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The Hebrew word which the LXX. have here written in Greek characters without translating it, is rendered in the place A.V. by meadow, in Job 8.11, the only other passage where it occurs, by flag.  </span>   <span class="verse" rel="v00141  003" id="41  003" >3</span>
 And other seven cows came up after these out of the river, ill-favoured and lean-fleshed, and fed by the   other   cows on the bank of the river.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  004" id="41  004" >4</span>
 And the seven ill-favoured and lean cows devoured the seven well-favoured and choice-fleshed cows; and Pharao awoke.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  005" id="41  005" >5</span>
 And he dreamed again. And, behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, choice and good.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  006" id="41  006" >6</span>
 And, behold, seven ears thin and blasted with the wind, grew up after them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  007" id="41  007" >7</span>
 And the seven thin ears and blasted with the wind devoured the seven choice and full ears; and Pharao awoke, and it was a dream.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  008" id="41  008" >8</span>
 And it was morning, and his soul was troubled; and he sent and called all the interpreters of Egypt, and all her wise men; and Pharao related to them his dream, and there was no one to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, tell.  </span>  interpret it to Pharao.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  009" id="41  009" >9</span>
 And the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharao, saying, I this day remember my fault:  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  010" id="41  010" >10</span>
 Pharao was angry with his servants, and put us in prison in the house of the captain of the guard, both me and the chief baker.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  011" id="41  011" >11</span>
 And we  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. saw.  </span>  had a dream both in one night, I and he; we saw, each according to his dream.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  012" id="41  012" >12</span>
 And there was there with us a young man, a Hebrew servant of the captain of the guard; and we related to him   our dreams  , and he interpreted   them   to us.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  013" id="41  013" >13</span>
 And it came to pass, as he interpreted them to us, so also it happened, both that I was restored to my office, and that he was hanged.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  014" id="41  014" >14</span>
 And Pharao having sent, called Joseph; and they brought him out from the prison, and shaved him, and changed his dress, and he came to Pharao.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  015" id="41  015" >15</span>
 And Pharao said to Joseph, I have seen a vision, and there is no one to interpret it; but I have heard  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. men saying.  </span>  say concerning you that you did hear dreams and interpret them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  016" id="41  016" >16</span>
 And Joseph answered Pharao and said, Without God an answer of safety shall not be given to Pharao.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  017" id="41  017" >17</span>
 And Pharao spoke to Joseph, saying, In my dream I thought I stood by the bank of the river;  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  018" id="41  018" >18</span>
 and there came up as it were out of the river, seven cows well-favoured and choice-fleshed, and they fed on the sedge.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  019" id="41  019" >19</span>
 And behold seven other cows came up after them out of the river, evil and ill-favoured and lean-fleshed, such that I never saw worse in all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  020" id="41  020" >20</span>
 And the seven ill-favoured and thin cows ate up the seven first good and choice cows.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  021" id="41  021" >21</span>
 And they went into their bellies; and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. they were.  </span>  it was not perceptible that they had gone into their bellies, and their appearance was ill-favoured, as also at the beginning; and after I awoke I slept,  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  022" id="41  022" >22</span>
 and saw again in my sleep, and as it were seven ears came up on one stem, full and good.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  023" id="41  023" >23</span>
 And other seven ears, thin and blasted with the wind, sprang up close to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  024" id="41  024" >24</span>
 And the seven thin and blasted ears devoured the seven fine and full ears: so I spoke to the interpreters, and there was no one to explain it to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  025" id="41  025" >25</span>
 And Joseph said to Pharao, The dream of Pharao is one; whatever God does, he has shown to Pharao.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  026" id="41  026" >26</span>
 The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream of Pharao is one.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  027" id="41  027" >27</span>
 And the seven thin kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven thin and blasted ears are seven years; there shall be seven years of famine.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  028" id="41  028" >28</span>
 And as for the word which I have told Pharao, whatever God intends to do, he has shown to Pharao:  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  029" id="41  029" >29</span>
 behold, for seven years there is coming great plenty in all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  030" id="41  030" >30</span>
 But there shall come seven years of famine after these, and they shall forget the plenty that shall be in all Egypt, and the famine shall consume the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  031" id="41  031" >31</span>
 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of the famine that shall be after this, for it shall be very grievous.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  032" id="41  032" >32</span>
 And concerning the repetition of the dream to Pharao twice,   it is   because the saying which is from God shall be true, and God will hasten to accomplish it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  033" id="41  033" >33</span>
 Now then, look out a wise and prudent man, and set him over the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  034" id="41  034" >34</span>
 And let Pharao make and appoint local governors over the land; and let them take up a fifth part of all the produce of the land of Egypt for the seven years of the plenty.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  035" id="41  035" >35</span>
 And let them gather all the food of these seven good years that are coming, and let the corn be gathered under the hand of Pharao; let food be kept in the cities.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  036" id="41  036" >36</span>
 And the stored food shall be for the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; and the land shall not be utterly destroyed by the famine.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  037" id="41  037" >37</span>
 And the word was pleasing in the sight of Pharao, and in the sight of all his servants.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  038" id="41  038" >38</span>
 And Pharao said to all his servants, Shall we find such a man as this, who has the Spirit of God in him?  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  039" id="41  039" >39</span>
 And Pharao said to Joseph, Since God has showed you all these things, there is not a wiser or more prudent man than you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  040" id="41  040" >40</span>
 You shall be over my house, and all my people shall be obedient to your  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. mouth.  </span>  word; only in the throne will I excel you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  041" id="41  041" >41</span>
 And Pharao said to Joseph, Behold, I set you this day over all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  042" id="41  042" >42</span>
 And Pharao took his ring off his hand, and put it on the hand of Joseph, and put on him a robe of fine linen, and put a necklace of gold about his neck.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  043" id="41  043" >43</span>
 And he mounted him on the second of his chariots, and a herald made proclamation before him; and he set him over all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  044" id="41  044" >44</span>
 And Pharao said to Joseph, I am Pharao; without you no one shall lift up his hand on all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  045" id="41  045" >45</span>
 And Pharao called the name of Joseph, Psonthomphanech; and he gave him Aseneth, the daughter of Petephres, priest of Heliopolis, to wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  046" id="41  046" >46</span>
 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharao, king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharao, and went through all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  047" id="41  047" >47</span>
 And the land produced, in the seven years of plenty,   whole   handfuls   of corn  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  048" id="41  048" >48</span>
 And he gathered all the food of the seven years, in which was the plenty in the land of Egypt; and he laid up the food in the cities; the food of the fields of a city round about it he laid up in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  049" id="41  049" >49</span>
 And Joseph gathered very much corn as the sand of the sea, until it could not be numbered, for there was no number   of it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  050" id="41  050" >50</span>
 And to Joseph were born two sons, before the seven years of famine came, which Aseneth, the daughter of Petephres, priest of Heliopolis, bore to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  051" id="41  051" >51</span>
 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn, Manasse; for God,   said he  , has made me forget all my toils, and all  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. things belong to my father.  </span>  my father's house.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  052" id="41  052" >52</span>
 And he called the name of the second, Ephraim; for God,   said he  , has increased me in the land of my humiliation.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  053" id="41  053" >53</span>
 And the seven years of plenty passed away, which were in the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  054" id="41  054" >54</span>
 And the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph said; and there was a famine in all the land; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  055" id="41  055" >55</span>
 And all the land of Egypt was hungry; and the people cried to Pharao for bread. And Pharao said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph, and do whatever he shall tell you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  056" id="41  056" >56</span>
 And the famine was on the face of all the earth; and Joseph opened all the granaries, and sold to all the Egyptians.  <span class="verse" rel="v00141  057" id="41  057" >57</span>
 And all countries came to Egypt to buy of Joseph, for the famine prevailed in all the earth.

<p><span class="chapter" id="42  001">42  </span> And Jacob having seen that there was a sale   of corn   in Egypt, said to his sons, Why are you° indolent?  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  002" id="42  002" >2</span>
 Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt; go down there, and buy for us a little food, that we may live, and not die.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  003" id="42  003" >3</span>
 And the ten brethren of Joseph went down to buy corn out of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  004" id="42  004" >4</span>
 But   Jacob   sent not Benjamin, the brother of Joseph, with his brethren; for he said, Lest, haply, disease befall him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  005" id="42  005" >5</span>
 And the sons of Israel came to buy with those that came, for the famine was in the land of Chanaan.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  006" id="42  006" >6</span>
 And Joseph was ruler of the land; he sold to all the people of the land. And the brethren of Joseph, having come, did reverence to him,   bowing   with the face to the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  007" id="42  007" >7</span>
 And when Joseph saw his brethren, he knew them, and estranged himself from them, and spoke hard words to them; and said to them, Whence are you° come? And they said, Out of the land of Chanaan, to buy food.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  008" id="42  008" >8</span>
 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  009" id="42  009" >9</span>
 And Joseph remembered his dream, which he saw; and he said to them, You° are spies; to observe the marks of the land are you° come.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  010" id="42  010" >10</span>
 But they said, Nay, Sir, we your servants are come to buy food;  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  011" id="42  011" >11</span>
 we are all sons of one man; we are peaceful, your servants are not spies.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  012" id="42  012" >12</span>
 And he said to them, Nay, but you° are come to observe the marks of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  013" id="42  013" >13</span>
 And they said, We your servants are twelve brethren, in the land of Chanaan; and, behold, the youngest is with our father today, but the other one is not.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  014" id="42  014" >14</span>
 And Joseph said to them, This is it that I spoke to you, saying, you° are spies;  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  015" id="42  015" >15</span>
 herein shall you° be manifested; by the health of Pharao, you° shall not depart hence, unless your younger brother come here.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  016" id="42  016" >16</span>
 Send one of you, and take your brother; and go you° to prison, till your words be clear, whether you° speak the truth or not; but, if not, by the health of Pharao, verily you° are spies.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  017" id="42  017" >17</span>
 And he put them in prison three days.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  018" id="42  018" >18</span>
 And he said to them on the third day, This do, and you° shall live, for I fear God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  019" id="42  019" >19</span>
 If you° be peaceful, let one of your brethren be detained in prison; but go you°, and carry back the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. the purchase of your gift of corn.  </span>  corn you° have purchased.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  020" id="42  020" >20</span>
 And bring your younger brother to me, and your words shall be believed; but, if not, you° shall die. And they did so.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  021" id="42  021" >21</span>
 And each said to his brother, Yes, indeed, for we are in fault concerning our brother, when we disregarded the anguish of his soul, when he implored us, and we listened not to him; and therefore has this affliction come upon us.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  022" id="42  022" >22</span>
 And Ruben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Hurt not the boy, and you° heard me not? and, behold, his blood is required.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  023" id="42  023" >23</span>
 But they knew not that Joseph  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. heard them.  </span>  understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  024" id="42  024" >24</span>
 And Joseph turned away from them, and wept; and again he came to them, and spoke to them; and he took Symeon from them, and bound him before their eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  025" id="42  025" >25</span>
 And Joseph gave orders to fill their vessels with corn, and to return their money to each into his sack, and to give them provision for the way; and it was so done to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  026" id="42  026" >26</span>
 And having put the corn on the asses, they departed thence.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  027" id="42  027" >27</span>
 And one having opened his sack to give his asses fodder, at the place where they rested, saw also his bundle of money, for it was on the mouth of his sack.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  028" id="42  028" >28</span>
 And he said to his brethren, My money has been restored to me, and behold this is in my sack. And their heart was wonder-struck, and they were troubled, saying one to another, What is this that God has done to us?  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  029" id="42  029" >29</span>
 And they came to their father, Jacob, into the land of Chanaan, and reported to him all that had happened to them, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  030" id="42  030" >30</span>
 The man, the lord of the land, spoke harsh words to us, and put us in prison as spies of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  031" id="42  031" >31</span>
 And we said to him, We are men of peace, we are not spies.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  032" id="42  032" >32</span>
 We are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is with his father today in the land of Chanaan.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  033" id="42  033" >33</span>
 And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, Herein shall I know that you° are peaceful; leave one brother here with me, and having taken the corn you° have purchased for your family, depart.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  034" id="42  034" >34</span>
 And bring to me your younger brother; then I shall know that you° are not spies, but that you° are men of peace: and I will restore you your brother, and you° shall trade in the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  035" id="42  035" >35</span>
 And it came to pass as they were emptying their sacks, there was each man's bundle of money in his sack; and they and their father saw their bundles of money, and they were afraid.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  036" id="42  036" >36</span>
 And their father Jacob said to them, You° have bereaved me. Joseph is not, Symeon is not, and will you° take Benjamin? all these things have come upon me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  037" id="42  037" >37</span>
 And Ruben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to you; give him into my hand, and I will bring him back to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00142  038" id="42  038" >38</span>
 But he said, My son shall not go down with you, because his brother is dead, and he only has been left; and   suppose   it shall come to pass that he is afflicted by the way by which you° go, then you° shall bring down my old age with sorrow to Hades.

<p><span class="chapter" id="43  001">43  </span> But the famine prevailed in the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  002" id="43  002" >2</span>
 And it came to pass, when they had finished eating the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, that their father said to them, Go again; buy us a little food.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  003" id="43  003" >3</span>
 And Judas spoke to him, saying, The man, the lord of the country, positively testified to us, saying, You° shall not see my face, unless your younger brother be with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  004" id="43  004" >4</span>
 If, then, you send our brother with us, we will go down, and buy you food;  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  005" id="43  005" >5</span>
 but if you send not our brother with us, we will not go: for the man spoke to us, saying, You° shall not see my face, unless your younger brother be with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  006" id="43  006" >6</span>
 And Israel said, Why did you° harm me, inasmuch as you° told the man that you° had a brother?  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  007" id="43  007" >7</span>
 And they said, The man closely questioned us about our family also, saying, Does your father yet live, and have you° a brother? and we answered him according to this question: did we know that he would say to us, Bring your brother?  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  008" id="43  008" >8</span>
 And Judas said to his father Israel, Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you, and our store.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  009" id="43  009" >9</span>
 And I engage for him; at my hand do you require him; if I bring him not to you, and place him before you, I shall be guilty toward you for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  010" id="43  010" >10</span>
 For if we had not tarried, we should now have returned twice.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  011" id="43  011" >11</span>
 And Israel, their father, said to them, If it be so, do this; take of the fruits of the earth in your vessels, and carry down to the man presents of gum and honey, and frankincense, and stacte, and turpentine, and walnuts.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  012" id="43  012" >12</span>
 And take double money in your hands, and the money that was returned in your sacks, carry back with you, lest perhaps it is a mistake.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  013" id="43  013" >13</span>
 And take your  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. one.  </span>  brother; and arise, go down to the man.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  014" id="43  014" >14</span>
 And my God give you favor in the sight of the man, and send away your other brother, and Benjamin, for I accordingly as I have been bereaved, am bereaved.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  015" id="43  015" >15</span>
 And the men having taken these presents, and the double money, took in their hands also Benjamin; and they rose up and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  016" id="43  016" >16</span>
 And Joseph saw them and his brother Benjamin, born of the same mother; and he said to the steward of his household, Bring the men into the house, and kill beasts and make ready, for the men are to eat bread with me at noon.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  017" id="43  017" >17</span>
 And the man did as Joseph said; and he brought the men into the house of Joseph.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  018" id="43  018" >18</span>
 And the men, when they perceived that they were brought into the house of Joseph, said, We are brought in because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first; even in order to inform against us, and lay it to our charge; to take us for servants, and our asses.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  019" id="43  019" >19</span>
 And having approached the man who was over the house of Joseph, they spoke to him in the porch of the house,  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  020" id="43  020" >20</span>
 saying, We pray   you  , Sir; we came down at first to buy food.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  021" id="43  021" >21</span>
 And it came to pass, when we came to unlade, and opened our sacks,   there was   also this money of each in his sack; we have now brought back our money by weight in our hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  022" id="43  022" >22</span>
 And we have brought other money with us to buy food; we know not who put the money into our sacks.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  023" id="43  023" >23</span>
 And he said to them,   God deal   mercifully with you; be not afraid; your God, and the God of your fathers, has given you treasures in your sacks, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        q.d. I am satisfied with the money you have given me, both as to quality and quantity.  </span>  I have enough of your good money. And he brought Symeon out to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  024" id="43  024" >24</span>
 And he brought water to wash their feet; and gave provender to their asses.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  025" id="43  025" >25</span>
 And they prepared their gifts, until Joseph came at noon, for they heard that he was going to dine there.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  026" id="43  026" >26</span>
 And Joseph entered into the house, and they brought him the gifts which they had in their hands, into the house; and they did him reverence with their face to the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  027" id="43  027" >27</span>
 And he asked them, How are you°? and he said to them, Is your father, the old man of whom you° spoke, well? Does he yet live?  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  028" id="43  028" >28</span>
 And they said, Your servant our father is well; he is yet alive. And he said, Blessed be that man by God; —and they bowed, and did him reverence.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  029" id="43  029" >29</span>
 And Joseph  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. having looked up with, etc.  </span>  lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, born of the same mother; and he said, Is this your younger brother, whom you° spoke of bringing to me? and he said, God have mercy on you, my son.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  030" id="43  030" >30</span>
 And Joseph was troubled, for his bowels yearned over his brother, and he sought to weep; and he went into his chamber, and wept there.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  031" id="43  031" >31</span>
 And he washed his face and came out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  032" id="43  032" >32</span>
 And they set on   bread   for him alone, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians feasting with him by themselves, for the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for it is an abomination to the Egyptians.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  033" id="43  033" >33</span>
 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his seniority, and the younger according to his youth; and the men  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. were amazed.  </span>  looked with amazement every one at his brother.  <span class="verse" rel="v00143  034" id="43  034" >34</span>
 And they took their portions from him to themselves; but Benjamin's portion was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. was magnified beyond the portions of all five times in comparison of theirs.  </span>  five times as much as the portions of   the others  . And they drank and were filled with drink with him.

<p><span class="chapter" id="44  001">44  </span> And Joseph charged the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put the money of each in the mouth of his sack.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  002" id="44  002" >2</span>
 And put my silver cup into the sack of the youngest, and the price of his corn. And it was done according to the word of Joseph, as he said.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  003" id="44  003" >3</span>
 The morning dawned, and the men were sent away, they and their asses.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  004" id="44  004" >4</span>
 And when they had gone out of the city,   and   were not far off, then Joseph said to his steward, Arise, and pursue after the men; and you shall overtake them, and say to them, Why have you° returned evil for good?  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  005" id="44  005" >5</span>
 Why have you° stolen my silver cup? is it not this  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. in which.  </span>  out of which my lord drinks? and he divines augury with it; you° have accomplished evil in that which you° have done.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  006" id="44  006" >6</span>
 And he found them, and spoke to them according to these words.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  007" id="44  007" >7</span>
 And they said to him, Why does our lord speak according to these words? far be it from your servants to do according to this word.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  008" id="44  008" >8</span>
 If we brought back to you out of the land of Chanaan the money which we found in our sacks, how should we steal silver or gold out of the house of your lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  009" id="44  009" >9</span>
 With whoever of your servants you shall find the cup, let him die; and, moreover, we will be servants to our lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  010" id="44  010" >10</span>
 And he said, Now then it shall be as you° say; with whoever the cup shall be found, he shall be my servant, and you° shall be clear.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  011" id="44  011" >11</span>
 And they hasted, and took down every man his sack on the ground, and they opened every man his sack.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  012" id="44  012" >12</span>
 And he searched, beginning from the oldest, until he came to the youngest; and he found the cup in Benjamin's sack.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  013" id="44  013" >13</span>
 And they tore their garments, and laid each man his sack on his ass, and returned to the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  014" id="44  014" >14</span>
 And Judas and his brethren came in to Joseph, while he was yet there, and fell on the ground before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  015" id="44  015" >15</span>
 And Joseph said to them, What is this thing that you° have done? know you° not that a man such as I can surely divine?  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  016" id="44  016" >16</span>
 And Judas said, What shall we answer to our lord, or what shall we say, or wherein should we be justified?  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. but.  </span>  whereas God has discovered the unrighteousness of your servants; behold, we are slaves to our lord, both we and he with whom the cup has been found.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  017" id="44  017" >17</span>
 And Joseph said, Far be it from me to do this thing; the man with whom the cup has been found, he shall be my servant; but do you° go up with safety to your father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  018" id="44  018" >18</span>
 And Judas drew near him, and said, I pray, Sir, let your servant speak a word before you, and be not angry with your servant, for you are next to Pharao.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  019" id="44  019" >19</span>
 Sir, you asked your servants, saying, Have you° a father or a brother?  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  020" id="44  020" >20</span>
 And we said to   my   lord, We have a father, an old man, and he has a son of his old age, a young one, and his brother is dead, and he alone has been left behind to his mother, and his father loves him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  021" id="44  021" >21</span>
 And you said to they servants, Bring him down to me, and I will take care of him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  022" id="44  022" >22</span>
 And we said to   my   lord, The child will not be able to leave his father; but if he should leave his father, he will die.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  023" id="44  023" >23</span>
 But you said to they servants, Except your younger brother come down with you, you° shall not see my face again.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  024" id="44  024" >24</span>
 And it came to pass, when we went up to your servant our father, we reported to him the words of our lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  025" id="44  025" >25</span>
 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  026" id="44  026" >26</span>
 And we said, We shall not be able to go down; but if our younger brother go down with us, we will go down; for we shall not be able to see the man's face, our younger brother not being with us.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  027" id="44  027" >27</span>
 And your servant our father said to us, You° know that my wife bore me two   sons  ;  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  028" id="44  028" >28</span>
 and one is departed from me; and you° said that he was devoured of wild beasts, and I have not seen him until now.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  029" id="44  029" >29</span>
 If then you° take this one also from my presence, and an affliction happen to him by the way, then shall you° bring down my old age with sorrow to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. Hades.  </span>  the grave.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  030" id="44  030" >30</span>
 Now then, if I should go in to they servant, and our father, and the boy should not be with us, (and his life depends on this   lad's   life)  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  031" id="44  031" >31</span>
 —it shall even come to pass, when he sees the boy is not with us,   that   he will die, and your servants will bring down the old age of your servant, and our father, with sorrow to the grave.  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. Hades.  </span>   <span class="verse" rel="v00144  032" id="44  032" >32</span>
 For your servant has received the boy   in charge   from his father, saying, If I bring him not to you, and place him before you, I shall be guilty towards my father for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  033" id="44  033" >33</span>
 Now then I will remain a servant with you instead of the lad, a domestic of my lord; but let the lad go up with his brethren.  <span class="verse" rel="v00144  034" id="44  034" >34</span>
 For how shall I go up to my father, the lad not being with us? lest I behold the evils which will befall my father.

 And he uttered his voice with weeping; and all the Egyptians heard, and it was reported to the house of Pharao.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  003" id="45  003" >3</span>
 And Joseph said to his brethren, I am Joseph; does my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him, for they were troubled.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  004" id="45  004" >4</span>
 And Joseph said to his brethren, Draw near to me; and they drew near; and he said, I am your brother Joseph, whom you° sold into Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  005" id="45  005" >5</span>
 Now then be not grieved, and let it not seem hard to you that you° sold me hither, for God sent me before you for life.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  006" id="45  006" >6</span>
 For this second year there is famine on the earth, and there are yet five years remaining, in which there is to be neither plowing, nor mowing.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  007" id="45  007" >7</span>
 For God sent me before you, that there might be left to you a remnant upon the earth, even to nourish a great remnant of you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  008" id="45  008" >8</span>
 Now then you° did not send me hither, but God; and he has made me as a father of Pharao, and lord of all his house, and ruler of all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  009" id="45  009" >9</span>
 Hasten, therefore, and go up to my father, and say to him, These things says your son Joseph; God has made me lord of all the land of Egypt; come down therefore to me, and wait not.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  010" id="45  010" >10</span>
 And you shall dwell in the land of Gesem of Arabia; and you shall be near me, you and your sons, and your sons' sons, your sheep and your oxen, and whatever things are your.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  011" id="45  011" >11</span>
 And I will nourish you there: for the famine is yet for five years; lest you be consumed, and your sons, and all your possessions.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  012" id="45  012" >12</span>
 Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  013" id="45  013" >13</span>
 Report, therefore, to my father all my glory in Egypt, and all things that you° have seen, and make haste and bring down my father hither.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  014" id="45  014" >14</span>
 And he fell on his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept on him; and Benjamin wept on his neck.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  015" id="45  015" >15</span>
 And he kissed all his brethren, and wept on them; and after these things his brethren spoke to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  016" id="45  016" >16</span>
 And the report was carried into the house of Pharao, saying, Joseph's brethren are come; and Pharao was glad, and his household.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  017" id="45  017" >17</span>
 And Pharao said to Joseph, Say to your brethren, Do this; fill your waggons, and depart into the land of Chanaan.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  018" id="45  018" >18</span>
 And take up your father, and your possessions, and come to me; and I will give you of all the goods of Egypt, and you° shall eat the marrow of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  019" id="45  019" >19</span>
 And do you charge them thus; that they should take for them waggons out of the land of Egypt, for your little ones, and for your wives; and take up your father, and come.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  020" id="45  020" >20</span>
 And be not sparing in regard to your property, for all the good of Egypt shall be yours.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  021" id="45  021" >21</span>
 And the children of Israel did so; and Joseph gave to them waggons, according to the words spoken by king Pharao; and he gave them provision for the journey.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  022" id="45  022" >22</span>
 And he gave to them all two sets of raiment apiece; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of gold, and five changes of raiment.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  023" id="45  023" >23</span>
 And to his father he sent   presents   at the same rate, and ten asses, bearing some of all the good things of Egypt, and ten mules, bearing bread for his father for your journey.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  024" id="45  024" >24</span>
 And he sent away his brethren, and they went; and he said to them, Be not angry by the way.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  025" id="45  025" >25</span>
 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Chanaan, to Jacob their father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  026" id="45  026" >26</span>
 And they reported to him, saying, Your son Joseph is living, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt; and Jacob was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. amazed in mind.  </span>  amazed, for he did not believe them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  027" id="45  027" >27</span>
 But they spoke to him all the words uttered by Joseph, whatever he said to them; and having seen the chariots which Joseph sent to take him up, the spirit of Jacob their father revived.  <span class="verse" rel="v00145  028" id="45  028" >28</span>
 And Israel said, It is a great thing for me if Joseph my son is yet alive. I will go and see him before I die.

<p><span class="chapter" id="46  001">46  </span> And Israel departed, he and all that he had, and came to the well of the oath; and he offered sacrifice to the God of his father Isaac.  <span class="verse" rel="v00146  002" id="46  002" >2</span>
 And God spoke to Israel in a night vision, saying, Jacob, Jacob; and he said, What is it?  <span class="verse" rel="v00146  003" id="46  003" >3</span>
 And he says to him, I am the God of your fathers; fear not to go down into Egypt, for I will make you there a great nation.  <span class="verse" rel="v00146  004" id="46  004" >4</span>
 And I will go down with you into Egypt, and I will bring you up at the end; and Joseph shall put his hands on your eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00146  005" id="46  005" >5</span>
 And Jacob rose up from the well of the oath; and the sons of Israel took up their father, and the baggage, and their wives on the waggons, which Joseph sent to take them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00146  006" id="46  006" >6</span>
 And they took up their goods, and all their property, which they had gotten in the land of Chanaan; they came into the land of Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00146  007" id="46  007" >7</span>

 And the sons of Rachel, the wife of Jacob; Joseph, and Benjamin.  <span class="verse" rel="v00146  020" id="46  020" >20</span>
 And there were sons born to Joseph in the land of Egypt, whom Aseneth, the daughter of Petephres, priest of Heliopolis, bore to him,   even   Manasses and Ephraim.

 And Joseph said to his brethren, I will go up and tell Pharao, and will say to him, My brethren, and my father's house, who were in the land of Chanaan, are come to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00146  032" id="46  032" >32</span>
 And the men are shepherds; for they have been feeders of cattle, and they have brought with them their cattle, and their kine, and all their property.  <span class="verse" rel="v00146  033" id="46  033" >33</span>
 If then Pharao call you, and say to you, What is you occupation?  <span class="verse" rel="v00146  034" id="46  034" >34</span>
 You° shall say, We your servants are herdsmen from our youth until now, both we and our fathers: that you° may dwell in the land of Gesem of Arabia, for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.

<p><span class="chapter" id="47  001">47  </span> And Joseph came and told Pharao,   saying  , My father, and my brethren, and their cattle, and their oxen, and all their possessions, are come out of the land of Chanaan, and behold, they are in the land of Gesem.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  002" id="47  002" >2</span>
 And he took of his brethren five men, and set them before Pharao.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  003" id="47  003" >3</span>
 And Pharao said to the brethren of Joseph, What is your occupation? and they said to Pharao, Your servants are shepherds, both we and our father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  004" id="47  004" >4</span>
 And they said to Pharao, We are come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for the flocks of your servants, for the famine has prevailed in the land of Chanaan; now then,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, let us dwell. See 1 Tim 6.8.  </span>  we will dwell in the land of Gesem. And Pharao said to Joseph, Let them dwell in the land of Gesem; and if you know that there are among them able men, make them overseers of my cattle. So Jacob and his sons came into Egypt, to Joseph; and Pharao, king of Egypt, heard   of it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  005" id="47  005" >5</span>
 And Pharao spoke to Joseph, saying, Your father, and your brethren, are come to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  006" id="47  006" >6</span>
 Behold, the land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brethren in the best land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  007" id="47  007" >7</span>
 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharao; and Jacob blessed Pharao.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  008" id="47  008" >8</span>
 And Pharao said to Jacob, How many are the years of the days of your life?  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  009" id="47  009" >9</span>
 And Jacob said to Pharao, The days of the years of my life, wherein I sojourn, are a hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, they have not attained to the days of the life of my fathers, in which days they sojourned.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  010" id="47  010" >10</span>
 And Jacob blessed Pharao, and departed from him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  011" id="47  011" >11</span>
 And Joseph settled his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best land, in the land of Ramesses, as Pharao commanded.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  012" id="47  012" >12</span>
 And Joseph gave provision to his father, and his brethren, and to all the house of his father, corn for each person.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  013" id="47  013" >13</span>
 And there was no corn in all the land, for the famine prevailed greatly; and the land of Egypt, and the land of Chanaan, fainted for the famine.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  014" id="47  014" >14</span>
 And Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and the land of Chanaan,   in return for   the corn which they bought, and he distributed corn to them; and Joseph brought all the money into the house of Pharao.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  015" id="47  015" >15</span>
 And all the money failed out of the land of Egypt, and out of the land of Chanaan; and all the Egyptians came to Joseph, saying, Give us bread, and why do we die in your presence? for our money is spent.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  016" id="47  016" >16</span>
 And Joseph said to them, Bring your cattle, and I will give you bread for your cattle, if your money is spent.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  017" id="47  017" >17</span>
 And they brought their cattle to Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in return for their horses, and for their sheep, and for their oxen, and for their asses; and Joseph maintained them with bread for all their cattle in that year.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  018" id="47  018" >18</span>
 And that year passed, and they came to him in the second year, and said to him, Must we then be consumed from before our lord? for if our money has failed, and our possessions, and our cattle,   brought   to you our lord, and there has not been left to us before our lord more than our own bodies and our land,   we are indeed destitute  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  019" id="47  019" >19</span>
 In order, then, that we die not before you, and the land be made desolate, buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharao: give seed that we may sow, and live and not die, so our land shall not be made desolate.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  020" id="47  020" >20</span>
 And Joseph bought all the land of the Egyptians, for Pharao; for the Egyptians sold their land to Pharao; for the famine prevailed against them, and the land became Pharao's.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  021" id="47  021" >21</span>
 And he brought the people into bondage to him, for servants, from one extremity of Egypt to the other,  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  022" id="47  022" >22</span>
 except only the land of the priests; Joseph bought not this, for Pharao gave a portion in the way of gift to the priests; and they ate their portion which Pharao gave them; therefore they sold not their land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  023" id="47  023" >23</span>
 And Joseph said to all the Egyptians, Behold, I have bought you and your land this day for Pharao; take seed for you, and sow the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  024" id="47  024" >24</span>
 And there shall be the fruits of it; and you° shall give the fifth part to Pharao, and the four   remaining   parts shall be for yourselves, for seed for the earth, and for food for you, and all that are in your houses.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  025" id="47  025" >25</span>
 And they said, You have saved us; we have found favor before our lord, and we will be servants to Pharao.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  026" id="47  026" >26</span>
 And Joseph appointed it to them for an ordinance until this day; to reserve a fifth part for Pharao, on the land of Egypt, except only the land of the priests, that was not Pharao's.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  027" id="47  027" >27</span>
 And Israel lived in Egypt, in the land of Gesem, and they gained an inheritance upon it; and they increased and multiplied very greatly.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  028" id="47  028" >28</span>
 And Jacob survived seventeen years in the land of Egypt; and Jacob's days of the years of his life were a hundred and forty-seven years.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  029" id="47  029" >29</span>
 and the days of Israel drew near for him to die: and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If I have found favor before you, put your hand under my thigh, and you shall execute mercy and truth toward me, so as not to bury me in Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  030" id="47  030" >30</span>
 But I will sleep with my fathers, and you shall carry me up out of Egypt, and bury me in their sepulchre. And he said, I will do according to your word.  <span class="verse" rel="v00147  031" id="47  031" >31</span>
 And he said, Swear to me; and he swore to him. And Israel did reverence, leaning on the top of his staff.

<p><span class="chapter" id="48  001">48  </span> And it came to pass after these things, that it was reported to Joseph, Behold, your father is ill; and, having taken his two sons, Manasse and Ephraim, he came to Jacob.  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  002" id="48  002" >2</span>
 And it was reported to Jacob, saying, Behold, your son Joseph comes to you; and Israel having strengthened himself, sat upon the bed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  003" id="48  003" >3</span>
 And Jacob said to Joseph, My God appeared to me in Luza, in the land of Chanaan, and blessed me,  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  004" id="48  004" >4</span>
 and said to me, Behold, I will increase you, and multiply you, and will make of you multitudes of nations; and I will give this land to you, and to your seed after you, for an everlasting possession.  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  005" id="48  005" >5</span>
 Now then your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt, before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasse, as Ruben and Symeon they shall be mine.  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  006" id="48  006" >6</span>
 And the children which you shall beget hereafter, shall be in the name of their brethren; they shall be named after their inheritances.  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  007" id="48  007" >7</span>
 And as for me, when I came out of Mesopotamia of Syria, Rachel, your mother, died in the land of Chanaan, as I drew night to the horse-course of Chabratha of the land   of Chanaan  , so as to come to Ephratha; and I buried her in the road of the course; this is Bethlehem.  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  008" id="48  008" >8</span>
 And when Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he said, Who are these to you?  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  009" id="48  009" >9</span>
 And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God gave me here; and Jacob said, Bring me them, that I may bless them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  010" id="48  010" >10</span>
 Now the eyes of Israel were dim through age, and he could not see; and he brought them near to him, and he kissed them, and embraced them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  011" id="48  011" >11</span>
 And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I have not been deprived of   seeing   your face, and behold! God has showed me your seed also.  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  012" id="48  012" >12</span>
 And Joseph brought them out from   between   his knees, and they did reverence to him, with their face to the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  013" id="48  013" >13</span>
 And Joseph took his two sons, both Ephraim in his right hand, but on the left of Israel, and Manasse on his left hand, but on the right of Israel, and brought them near to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  014" id="48  014" >14</span>
 But Israel having stretched out his right hand, laid it on the head of Ephraim, and he was the younger; and his left hand on the head of Manasse,   guiding   his hands crosswise.  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  015" id="48  015" >15</span>
 And he blessed them and said, The God in whose sight my fathers were well pleasing,   even   Abraam and Isaac, the God who continues to feed me from my youth until this day;  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  016" id="48  016" >16</span>
 the angel who delivers me from all evils, bless these boys, and my name shall be called upon them, and the name of my fathers, Abraam and Isaac; and let them be increased to a great multitude on the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  017" id="48  017" >17</span>
 And Joseph having seen that his father put his right hand on the head of Ephraim—it seemed grievous to him; and Joseph took hold of the hand of his father, to remove it from the head of Ephraim to the head of Manasse.  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  018" id="48  018" >18</span>
 And Joseph said to his father, Not so, father; for this is the firstborn; lay your right-hand upon his head.  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  019" id="48  019" >19</span>
 And he would not, but said, I know it, son, I know it; he also shall be a people, and he shall be exalted, but his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  020" id="48  020" >20</span>
 And he blessed them in that day, saying, In you shall Israel be blessed, saying, God make you as Ephraim and Manasse; and he set Ephraim before Manasse.  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  021" id="48  021" >21</span>
 And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die; and God shall be with you, and restore you to the land of your fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v00148  022" id="48  022" >22</span>
 And I give to you Sicima, a select portion above your brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorites with my sword and bow.

<p><span class="chapter" id="50  001">50  </span> And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept on him, and kissed him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  002" id="50  002" >2</span>
 And Joseph commanded his servants the embalmers to embalm his father; and the embalmers embalmed Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  003" id="50  003" >3</span>
 And they fulfilled forty days for him, for so are the days of embalming numbered; and Egypt mourned for him seventy days.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  004" id="50  004" >4</span>
 And when the days of mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the princes of Pharao, saying, If I have found favor in your sight, speak concerning me in the ears of Pharao, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  005" id="50  005" >5</span>
 My father adjured me, saying, In the sepulchre which I dug for myself in the land of Chanaan, there you shall bury me; now then I will go up and bury my father, and return again.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  006" id="50  006" >6</span>
 And Pharao said to Joseph, Go up, bury your father, as he constrained you to swear.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  007" id="50  007" >7</span>
 So Joseph went up to bury his father; and all the servants of Pharao went up with him, and the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  008" id="50  008" >8</span>
 And all the household of Joseph, and his brethren, and all the house of his father, and his kindred; and they left behind the sheep and the oxen in the land of Gesem.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  009" id="50  009" >9</span>
 And there went up with him also chariots and horsemen; and there was a very great company.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  010" id="50  010" >10</span>
 And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan; and they bewailed him with a great and very sore lamentation; and he made a mourning for his father seven days.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  011" id="50  011" >11</span>
 And the inhabitants of the land of Chanaan saw the mourning at the floor of Atad, and said, This is a great mourning to the Egyptians; therefore he called its name, The mourning of Egypt, which is beyond Jordan.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  012" id="50  012" >12</span>
 And thus his sons did to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  013" id="50  013" >13</span>
 So his sons carried him up into the land of Chanaan, and buried him in the double cave, which cave Abraam bought for possession of a burying place, of Ephrom the Chettite, before Mambre.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  014" id="50  014" >14</span>
 And Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brethren, and those that had gone up with him to bury his father.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  015" id="50  015" >15</span>
 And when the brethren of Joseph saw that their father was dead, they said,   Let us take heed  , lest at any time Joseph remember evil against us, and recompense to us all the evils which we have done against him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  016" id="50  016" >16</span>
 And they came to Joseph, and said, Your father adjured   us   before his death, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  017" id="50  017" >17</span>
 Thus say you° to Joseph, Forgive them their injustice and their sin, forasmuch as they have done you evil; and now  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. accept.  </span>  pardon the injustice of the servants of the God of your father.

 And they came to him and said, We, these   persons  , are your servants.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  019" id="50  019" >19</span>
 And Joseph said to them, Fear not, for I am God's.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  020" id="50  020" >20</span>
 You° took counsel against me for evil, but God took counsel for me for good, that   the matter   might be as   it is   today, and much people might be fed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  021" id="50  021" >21</span>
 And he said to them, Fear not, I will maintain you, and your families: and he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  022" id="50  022" >22</span>
 And Joseph lived in Egypt, he and his brethren, and all the family of his father; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  023" id="50  023" >23</span>
 And Joseph saw the children of Ephraim to the third generation; and the sons of Machir the son of Manasse were borne on the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. thighs.  </span>  sides of Joseph.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  024" id="50  024" >24</span>
 And Joseph spoke to his brethren, saying, I die, and God will surely visit you, and will bring you out of this land to the land concerning which God sware to our fathers, Abraam, Isaac, and Jacob.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  025" id="50  025" >25</span>
 And Joseph adjured the sons of Israel, saying, At the visitation with which God shall visit you, then you° shall carry up my bones hence with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00150  026" id="50  026" >26</span>
 And Joseph died, aged an hundred and ten years; and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. buried him.  </span>  they prepared his corpse, and put him in a coffin in Egypt.
