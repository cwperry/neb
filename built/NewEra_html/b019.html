 Therefore the ungodly shall not rise in judgment, nor sinners in the counsel of the just.  
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v0191  006" id="1  006" >6</span>

 The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers gathered themselves together, against the Lord, and against his Christ;

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v01977  047" id="77  047" >47</span>
 He killed their vines with hail, and their sycamores with frost.  
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v01977  048" id="77  048" >48</span>
 And he gave up their cattle to hail, and their substance to the fire.  
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v01977  049" id="77  049" >49</span>
 He sent out against them the fury of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and affliction, a message by evil angels.  
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v01977  050" id="77  050" >50</span>
 He made a way for his wrath; he spared not their souls from death, but consigned their cattle to death;  
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v01977  051" id="77  051" >51</span>
 and struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt; the first fruits of their labors in the tents of Cham.  
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v01977  052" id="77  052" >52</span>
