<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">T</span>he word of God which came to Jeremias the   son   of Chelcias, of the priests, who lived in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:  <span class="verse" rel="v0241  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
    accordingly   as the word of God came to him in the days of Josias son of Amos king of Juda, in the thirteenth year of his reign.  <span class="verse" rel="v0241  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 And it was in the days of Joakim, son of Josias king of Juda, until the eleventh year of Sedekias king of Juda,   even   until the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.  <span class="verse" rel="v0241  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to him,   saying  ,  <span class="verse" rel="v0241  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 Before I formed you in the belly, I knew you; and before you came forth from the womb, I sanctified you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0241  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 And I said, O Lord, you that are supreme Lord, behold, I know not   how   to speak, for I am a child.  <span class="verse" rel="v0241  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 And the Lord said to me, Say not, I am a child: for you shall go to all to whoever I shall send you, and according to all   the words   that I shall command you, you shall speak.  <span class="verse" rel="v0241  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 Be not afraid before them: for I am with you to deliver you, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0241  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 And the Lord stretched forth his hand to me, and touched my mouth: and the Lord said to me, Behold, I have put my words into your mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0241  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 Behold, I have appointed you this day over nations and over kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to rebuild, and to plant.  <span class="verse" rel="v0241  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, What see you? And I said, A rod of an almond tree.  <span class="verse" rel="v0241  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 And the Lord said to me, You have well seen: for I have watched over my words to perform them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0241  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying, What see you? And I said, A caldron on the fire; and the face of it is toward the north.  <span class="verse" rel="v0241  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 And the Lord said to me, From the north shall flame forth evils upon all the inhabitants of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0241  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 For, behold, I call together all the kingdoms of the earth from the north, says the Lord; and they shall come, and shall set each one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls round about her, and against all the cities of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v0241  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 And I will speak to them in judgment, concerning all their iniquity,   forasmuch   as they have forsaken me, and sacrificed to strange gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v0241  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 And do you gird up your loins, and stand up, and speak all   the words   that I shall command you: be not afraid of their face, neither be you alarmed before them; for I am with you to deliver you, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0241  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 Behold, I have made you this day as a strong city, and as a brazen wall, strong   against   all the kings of Juda, and the princes thereof, and the people of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0241  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 And they shall fight against you; but they shall by no means prevail against you; because I am with you, to deliver you, says the Lord.

<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> And he said, Thus says the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 I remember the kindness of your youth, and the love of your espousals,  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 in following the Holy One of Israel, says the Lord, Israel was the holy   people   to the Lord,   and   the first fruits of his increase: all that devoured him shall offend; evils shall come upon them, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 Hear the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and every family of the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 Thus says the Lord, What trespass have your fathers found in me, that they have revolted far from me, and gone after vanities, and become vain?  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 And they said not, Where is the Lord, who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who guided us in the wilderness, in an untried and trackless land, in a land which no man at all went through, and no man lived there?  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 And I brought you to Carmel, that you° should eat the fruits thereof, and the good thereof; and you° went in, and defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 The priests said not, Where is the Lord? and they that held by the law knew me not: the shepherds also sinned against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and went after that which profited not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 Therefore I will yet plead with you, and will plead with your children's children.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 For go to the isles of the Chettians, and se; and send to Kedar, and observe accurately, and see if such things have been done;  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 if the nations will change their gods, though they are not gods: but my people have changed their glory,   for that   from which they shall not be profited.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 The heaven is amazed at this, and is very exceedingly horror-struck, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 For my people has committed two   faults  , and evil ones: they have forsaken me, the fountain of water of life, and hewn out for themselves broken cisterns, which will not be able to hold water.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 Is Israel a servant, or a home-born slave? why has he become a spoil?  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 The lions roared upon him, and uttered their voice, which have made his land a wilderness: and his cities are broken down, that they should not be inhabited.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 Also the children of Memphis and Taphnas have known you, and mocked you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 Has not your forsaking me brought these things upon you? says the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 And now what have you to do with the way of Egypt, to drink the water of Geon? and what have you to do with the way of the Assyrians, to drink the water of rivers?  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 Your apostasy shall correct you, and your wickedness shall reprove you: know then, and see, that your forsaking me   has been   bitter to you, says the Lord your God; and I have taken no pleasure in you, says the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 For of old you have broken your yoke, and plucked asunder your bands; and you have said, I will not serve you, but will go upon every high hill, and under every shady tree, there will I indulge in my fornication.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 Yet I planted you a fruitful vine, entirely of the right sort: how are you a strange vine turned to bitterness!  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 Though you should wash yourself with nitre, and multiply to yourself soap,   still   you are stained by your iniquities before me, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  023" id="2  023" >23</span>
 How will you say, I am not polluted, and have not gone after Baal? behold your ways in the burial-ground, and know what you have done: her voice has howled in the evening:  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  024" id="2  024" >24</span>
 she has extended her ways over the waters of the desert; she was hurried along by the lusts of her soul; she is given up   to them  , who will turn her back? none that seek her shall be weary; at   the time of   her humiliation they shall find her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  025" id="2  025" >25</span>
 Withdraw your foot from a rough way, and your throat from thirst: but she said I will strengthen myself: for she loved strangers, and went after them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  026" id="2  026" >26</span>
 As is the shame of a thief when he is caught, so shall the children of Israel be ashamed; they, and their kings, and their princes, and their priests, and their prophets.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  027" id="2  027" >27</span>
 They said to a stock, You are my father; and to a stone, You have begotten me: and they have turned   their   backs to me, and not their faces: yet in the time of their afflictions they will say, Arise, and save us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  028" id="2  028" >28</span>
 And where are your gods, which you made for yourself? will they arise and save in the time of your affliction? for according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Juda; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem they sacrificed to Baal.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  029" id="2  029" >29</span>
 Therefore do you° speak to me? you° all have been ungodly, and you° all have transgressed against me, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  030" id="2  030" >30</span>
 In vain have I struck your children; you° have not received correction: a sword has devoured your prophets as a destroying lion; yet you° feared not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  031" id="2  031" >31</span>
 Hear you° the word of the Lord: thus says the Lord, Have I been a wilderness or a dry land to Israel? therefore has my people said, We will not be ruled over, and will not come to you any more?  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  032" id="2  032" >32</span>
 Will a bride forget her ornaments, or a virgin her girdle? but my people has forgotten me days without number.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  033" id="2  033" >33</span>
 What fair device will you yet employ in your ways, so as to seek love?   it shall   not   be   so; moreover you have done wickedly in corrupting your ways;  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  034" id="2  034" >34</span>
 and in your hands has been found the blood of innocent souls; I have not found them in holes, but on every oak.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  035" id="2  035" >35</span>
 Yet you said, I am innocent: only let his wrath be turned away from me. Behold, I   will   plead with you, whereas you say, I have not sinned.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  036" id="2  036" >36</span>
 For you have been so exceedingly contemptuous as to repeat your ways; but you shall be ashamed of Egypt, as you were ashamed of Assur.  <span class="verse" rel="v0242  037" id="2  037" >37</span>
 For you shall go forth thence also with your hands upon your head; for the Lord has rejected your hope, and you shall not prosper in it.  
<!-- 3   037 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> If a man put away his wife, and she depart from him, and become another man's, shall she return to him any more at all? shall not that woman be utterly defiled? you° you have gone a-whoring with many shepherds, and have returned to me, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 Lift up your eyes   to look   straight forward, and see where you have not been utterly defiled. You have sat for them by the wayside as a deserted crow, and have defiled the land with your fornications and your wickedness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 And you did retain many shepherds for a stumbling block to yourself: you had a whore's face, you did become shameless toward all.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 Hast you not called me as it were a home, and the father and guide of your virgin-time?  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 Will   God's anger   continue for ever, or be preserved to the end? Behold, you have spoken and done these bad things, and had power   to do them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 And the Lord said to me in the days of Josias the king, Hast you seen what things the house of Israel has done to me? they have gone on every high mountain, and under every shady tree, and have committed fornication there.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 And I said after she had committed all these acts of fornication, Turn again to me. Yet she returned not. And faithless Juda saw her faithlessness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 And I saw that (for all the sins of which she was convicted, wherein the house of Israel committed adultery, and I put her away, and gave into her hands a bill of divorcement,) yet faithless Juda feared not, but went and herself also committed fornication.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 And her fornication was nothing accounted of; and she committed adultery with wood and stone.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 And for all these things faithless Juda turned not to me with all her heart, but falsely.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 And the Lord said to me, Israel has justified himself more than faithless Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 Go and read these words toward the north, and you shall say, Return to me, O house of Israel, says the Lord; and I will not set my face against you: for I am merciful, says the Lord, and I will not be angry with you for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 Nevertheless, know your iniquity, that you have sinned against the Lord your God, and have scattered your ways to strangers under every shady tree, but you did not listen to my voice, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 Turn, you° children that have revolted, says the Lord; for I will rule over you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you in to Sion:  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 and I will give you shepherds after my heart, and they shall certainly tend you with knowledge.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 And it shall come to pass that when you° are multiplied and increased upon the land, says the Lord, in those days they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the Holy One of Israel: it shall not come to mind; it shall not be named; neither shall it be visited; nor shall   this   be done any more.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 In those days and at that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the Lord; and all the nations shall be gathered to it: and they shall not walk any more after the imaginations of their evil heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 In those days the house of Juda, shall come together to the house of Israel, and they shall come, together, from the land of the north, and from all the countries, to the land, which I caused their fathers to inherit.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  019" id="3  019" >19</span>
 And I said, So be it, Lord, for   you said   I will set you among children, and will give you a choice land, the inheritance of the Almighty God of the Gentiles: and I said, You° shall call me Father; and you° shall not turn away from me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  020" id="3  020" >20</span>
 But as a wife acts treacherously against her husband, so has the house of Israel dealt treacherously against me, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  021" id="3  021" >21</span>
 A voice from the lips was heard,   even   of weeping and supplication of the children of Israel: for they have dealt unrighteously in their ways, they have forgotten God their Holy One.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  022" id="3  022" >22</span>
 Turn, you° children that are given to turning, and I will heal your bruises. Behold, we will be your servants; for you are the Lord our God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  023" id="3  023" >23</span>
 Truly the hills and the strength of the mountains were a lying refuge: but by the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  024" id="3  024" >24</span>
 But shame has consumed the labors of our fathers from our youth; their sheep and their calves, and their sons and their daughters.  <span class="verse" rel="v0243  025" id="3  025" >25</span>
 We have lain down in our shame, and our disgrace has covered us: because we and our fathers have sinned before our God, from our youth until this day; and we have not listened to the voice of the Lord our God.

 Circumcise yourselves to your God, and circumcise your hardness of heart, you° men of Juda, and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my wrath go forth as fire, and burn, and there be none to quench it, because of the evil of your devices.  <span class="verse" rel="v0244  005" id="4  005" >5</span>

 The lion is gone up from his lair, he has roused   himself   to the destruction of the nations, and has gone forth out of his place, to make the land desolate; and the cities shall be destroyed, so as to be without inhabitant.  <span class="verse" rel="v0244  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 For these things gird yourselves with sackcloth, and lament, and howl: for the anger of the Lord is not turned away from you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0244  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 And it shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be amazed, and the prophets shall wonder.  <span class="verse" rel="v0244  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 And I said, O sovereign Lord, verily you have deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, There shall be peace; whereas behold, the sword has reached even to their soul.  <span class="verse" rel="v0244  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 At that time they shall say to this people and to Jerusalem,   There is   a spirit of error in the wilderness: the way of the daughter of my people is not to purity, nor to holiness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0244  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
    But   a spirit of full vengeance shall come upon me; and now I declare my judgments against them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0244  013" id="4  013" >13</span>

 I am pained in my bowels, my bowels, and the sensitive powers of my heart; my soul is in great commotion, my heart is torn: I will not be silent, for my soul has heard the sound of a trumpet, the cry of war, and of distress: it calls on destruction;  <span class="verse" rel="v0244  020" id="4  020" >20</span>
 for all the land is distressed: suddenly   my   tabernacle is distressed, my curtains have been tore asunder.  <span class="verse" rel="v0244  021" id="4  021" >21</span>
 How long shall I see fugitives, and hear the sound of the trumpet?  <span class="verse" rel="v0244  022" id="4  022" >22</span>
 For the princes of my people have not known me, they are foolish and unwise children: they are wise to do evil, but   how   to do good they have not known.  <span class="verse" rel="v0244  023" id="4  023" >23</span>

 For these things let the earth mourn, and let the sky be dark above: for I have spoken, and I will not repent; I have purposed, and I will not turn back from it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0244  029" id="4  029" >29</span>
 The whole land has recoiled from the noise of the horseman and the bent bow; they have gone into the caves, and have hidden themselves in the groves, and have gone up upon the rocks: every city was abandoned, no man lived in them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0244  030" id="4  030" >30</span>
 And what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with scarlet, and adorn yourself with golden ornaments; though you adorn your eyes with stibium, your beauty   will be   in vain: your lovers have rejected you, they seek your life.  <span class="verse" rel="v0244  031" id="4  031" >31</span>
 For I have heard your groaning as the voice of a woman in travail, as of her that brings forth her first child; the voice of the daughter of Zion shall fail through weakness, and she shall lose the strength of her hands,   saying  , Woe is me! for my soul faints because of the slain.

 The Lord lives, they say; do they not therefore swear falsely?  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 O Lord, your eyes are upon faithfulness: you have scourged them, but they have not grieved; you have consumed them; but they would not receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; and they would not return.  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 Then I said, It may be they are poor; for they are weak, for they know not the way of the Lord, or the judgment of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 I will go to the rich men, and will speak to them; for they have known the way of the Lord, and the judgment of God: but, behold, with one consent they have broken the yoke, they have burst the bonds.  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 Therefore has a lion out of the forest struck them, and a wolf has destroyed them even to   their   houses, and a leopard has watched against their cities: all that go forth from them shall be hunted: for they have multiplied their ungodliness, they have strengthened themselves in their revoltings.  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 In what   way   shall I forgive you for these things? Your sons have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: and I fed them to the full, and they committed adultery, and lodged in harlots' houses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 They became as wanton horses: they neighed each one after his neighbor's wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 Shall I not visit for these things? says the Lord: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this.  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 Go up upon her battlements, and break   them   down; but make not a full end: leave her buttresses: for they are the Lord's.  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  011" id="5  011" >11</span>
 For the house of Israel have indeed dealt treacherously against me, says the Lord: the house of Juda also  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  012" id="5  012" >12</span>

 Our prophets became wind, and the word of the Lord was not in them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord Almighty, Because you° have spoken this word, behold, I have made my words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  015" id="5  015" >15</span>
 Behold, I   will   bring upon you a nation from far, O house of Israel, says the Lord; a nation the sound of whose language one shall not understand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  016" id="5  016" >16</span>
    They are   all mighty men:  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  017" id="5  017" >17</span>
 and they shall devour your harvest, and your bread; and shall devour your sons, and your daughters; and they shall devour your sheep, and your calves, and devour your vineyards, and your fig-plantations, and your olive yards: and they shall utterly destroy your strong cities, wherein you° trusted, with the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  018" id="5  018" >18</span>
 And it shall come to pass in those days, says the Lord your God, that I will not utterly destroy you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  019" id="5  019" >19</span>
 And it shall come to pass, when you° shall say, Therefore has the Lord our God done all these things to us? that you shall say to them, Because you° served strange gods in your land, so shall you° serve strangers in a land that is not yours.  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  020" id="5  020" >20</span>
 Proclaim these things to the house of Jacob, and let them be heard in the house of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  021" id="5  021" >21</span>
 Hear you° now these things, O foolish and senseless people; who have eyes, and see not; and have ears, and hear not:  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  022" id="5  022" >22</span>
 will you° not be afraid of me? says the Lord; and will you° not fear before me, who have set the sand for a bound to the sea,   as   a perpetual ordinance, and it shall not pass it: yes, it shall rage, but not prevail; and its waves shall roar, but not pass over it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  023" id="5  023" >23</span>
 But this people has a disobedient and rebellious heart; and they have turned aside and gone back:  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  024" id="5  024" >24</span>
 and they have not said in their heart, Let us fear now the Lord our God, who gives us the early and latter rain, according to the season of the fulfillment of the ordinance of harvest, and has preserved   it   for us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  025" id="5  025" >25</span>
 Your transgressions have turned away these things, and your sins have removed good things from you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  026" id="5  026" >26</span>
 For among my people were found ungodly men; and they have set snares to destroy men, and have caught   them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  027" id="5  027" >27</span>
 As a snare which has been set is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore have they grown great, and become rich:  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  028" id="5  028" >28</span>
 and they have transgressed   the rule of   judgment; they have not judged the cause of the orphan, nor have they judged the cause of the widow.  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  029" id="5  029" >29</span>
 Shall I not visit for these things? says the Lord: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  030" id="5  030" >30</span>
 Shocking and horrible deeds have been done on the land;  <span class="verse" rel="v0245  031" id="5  031" >31</span>

 To whom shall I speak, and testify, that he may listen? behold, your ears are uncircumcised, and they shall not be able to hear: behold, the word of the Lord is become to them a reproach, they will not at all desire it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0246  011" id="6  011" >11</span>
 And I allowed my wrath to come to full, yet I kept   it   in, and did not utterly destroy them: I will pour it out on the children without, and on the assembly of young men together: for man and woman shall be taken together, the old man with him that is full of days.  <span class="verse" rel="v0246  012" id="6  012" >12</span>

 They were ashamed because they failed; yet they were not ashamed as those who are   truly   ashamed, and they knew not their own disgrace: therefore shall they   utterly   fall when they do fall, and in the time of visitation shall they perish, said the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0246  016" id="6  016" >16</span>
 Thus says the Lord, Stand you° in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths of the Lord; and see what is the good way, and walk in it, and you° shall find purification for your souls. But they said, We will not walk   in them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0246  017" id="6  017" >17</span>

 For go you° to my place with is in Selo, where I caused my name to dwell before, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  013" id="7  013" >13</span>
 And now, because you° have done all these deeds, and I spoke to you, but you° listened not to me; and I called you, but you° answered not;  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  014" id="7  014" >14</span>
 therefore I also will do to the house whereon my name is called, wherein you° trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Selo.  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  015" id="7  015" >15</span>
 And I will cast you out of my sight, as I cast away your brethren, all the seed of Ephraim.  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  016" id="7  016" >16</span>
 Therefore pray not you for this people, and intercede not for them to be pitied, yes, pray not, and approach me not for them: for I will not listen   to you  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  017" id="7  017" >17</span>
 Seest you not what they do in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem?  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  018" id="7  018" >18</span>
 Their children gather wood, and their fathers kindle a fire, and their women knead dough, to make cakes to the host of heaven; and they have poured out drink-offerings to strange gods, that they might provoke me to anger.  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  019" id="7  019" >19</span>
 Do they provoke me to anger? says the Lord: do they not   provoke   themselves, that their faces may be ashamed?  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  020" id="7  020" >20</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord; Behold, my anger and wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and upon the men, and upon the cattle, and upon every tree of their field, and upon the fruits of the land; and it shall burn, and not be quenched.  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  021" id="7  021" >21</span>
 Thus says the Lord, Gather your whole burnt offerings with your meat-offerings, and eat flesh.  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  022" id="7  022" >22</span>
 For I spoke not to your fathers, and commanded them not in the day wherein I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, concerning whole burnt offerings and sacrifice:  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  023" id="7  023" >23</span>
 but I commanded them this thing, saying, Hear you° my voice, and I will be to you a God, and you° shall be to me a people: and walk you° in all my ways which I shall command you, that it may be well with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  024" id="7  024" >24</span>
 But they listened not to me, and their ear gave no heed, but they walked in the imaginations of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward;  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  025" id="7  025" >25</span>
 from the day that their fathers went forth out of the land of Egypt, even until this day. And I sent to you all my servants, the prophets, by day and early in the morning: yes, I sent   them  ,  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  026" id="7  026" >26</span>
 but they listened not to me, and their ear gave no heed; and they made their neck harder than their fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  027" id="7  027" >27</span>
 Therefore you shall speak this word to them;  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  028" id="7  028" >28</span>
 This is the nation which has not listened to the voice of the Lord, nor received correction: truth has failed from their mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  029" id="7  029" >29</span>
 Cut off your hair, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on your lips; for the Lord has reprobated and rejected the generation that does these things.  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  030" id="7  030" >30</span>
 For the children of Juda have wrought evil before me, says the Lord; they have set their abominations in the house on which my name is called, to defile it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  031" id="7  031" >31</span>
 And they have built the altar of Taphes, which is in the valley of the son of Ennom, to burn their sons and their daughters with fire; which I did not command them   to do  , neither did I design it in my heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  032" id="7  032" >32</span>
 Therefore, behold, the days come, says the Lord, when they shall no more say, The altar of Taphes, and the valley of the son of Ennom, but, The valley of the slain; and they shall bury in Taphes, for lack of room.  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  033" id="7  033" >33</span>
 And the dead bodies of this people shall be for food to the birds of the sky, and to the wild beasts of the earth; and there shall be none to drive   them   away.  <span class="verse" rel="v0247  034" id="7  034" >34</span>
 And I will destroy out of the cities of Juda, and the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of them that make merry, and the voice of them that rejoice, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride; for the whole land shall become a desolation.

<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> At that time, says the Lord, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Juda, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves;  <span class="verse" rel="v0248  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 and they shall spread them out to the sun, and the moon, and to all the stars, and to all the host of heaven, which they have loved, and which they have served, and after which they have walked, and to which they have held, and which they have worshipped; they shall not be mourned for, neither shall they be buried; but they shall be for an example on the face of the earth,  <span class="verse" rel="v0248  003" id="8  003" >3</span>

 For thus says the Lord, Shall not he that falls arise? or he that turns away, shall he not turn back again?  <span class="verse" rel="v0248  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 Therefore has this my people turned away with a shameless revolting, and strengthened themselves in their willfulness, and refused to return?  <span class="verse" rel="v0248  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 Listen, I pray you, and hear: will they not speak thus, There is no man that repents of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? the runner has failed from his course, as a tired horse in his neighing.  <span class="verse" rel="v0248  007" id="8  007" >7</span>
 Yes, the stork in the heaven knows her time,   also   the turtle-dove and wild swallow; the sparrows observe the times of their coming in; but this my people knows not the judgments of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0248  008" id="8  008" >8</span>
 How will you° say, We are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us? In vain have the scribes used a false pen.  <span class="verse" rel="v0248  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 The wise men are ashamed, and alarmed, and taken; because they have rejected the word of the Lord; what wisdom is there in them?  <span class="verse" rel="v0248  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 Therefore will I give their wives to others, and their fields to   new   inheritors; and they shall gather their fruits, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0248  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 There are no grapes on the vines, and there are no figs on the fig-trees, and the leaves have fallen off.  <span class="verse" rel="v0248  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the strong cities, and let us be cast out there: for God has cast us out, and made us drink water of gall, because we have sinned before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0248  015" id="8  015" >15</span>
 We assembled for peace, but there was no prosperity; for a time of healing, but behold anxiety.  <span class="verse" rel="v0248  016" id="8  016" >16</span>
 We shall hear the neighing of his swift horses out of Dan: the whole land quaked at the sound of the neighing of his horses; and he shall come, and devour the land and the fullness of it; the city, and them that dwell in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0248  017" id="8  017" >17</span>

 Behold,   there is   a sound of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land afar off: Is not the Lord in Sion? is there not a king there? because they have provoked me with their graven   images  , and with strange vanities.  <span class="verse" rel="v0248  020" id="8  020" >20</span>
 The summer is gone, the harvest is past, and we are not saved.  <span class="verse" rel="v0248  021" id="8  021" >21</span>

 And is there no balm in Galaad, or is there no physician there? why has not the healing of the daughter of my people taken place?

 Who would give me a most distant lodge in the wilderness, that I might leave my people, and depart from them? for they all commit adultery, an assembly of treacherous men.  <span class="verse" rel="v0249  003" id="9  003" >3</span>
 And they have bent their tongue like a bow: falsehood and not faithfulness has prevailed upon the earth; for they have gone on from evil to evil, and have not known me, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0249  004" id="9  004" >4</span>
 Beware you° each of his neighbor, and trust you° not in your brethren: for every one will surely supplant, and every friend will walk craftily.  <span class="verse" rel="v0249  005" id="9  005" >5</span>
 Every one will mock his friend; they will not speak truth: their tongue has learned to speak falsehoods; they have committed iniquity, they ceased not, so as to return.  <span class="verse" rel="v0249  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
    There is   usury upon usury, and deceit upon deceit: they would not know me, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0249  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord, Behold, I will try them with fire, and prove them; for I will do   thus   because of the wickedness of the daughter of my people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0249  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 Their tongue is a wounding arrow; the words of their mouth are deceitful:   one   speaks peaceably to his neighbor, but in himself retains enmity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0249  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 Shall I not visit for these things? says the Lord: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a people as this?  <span class="verse" rel="v0249  010" id="9  010" >10</span>
 Take up a lamentation for the mountains, and a mournful dirge for the paths of the wilderness, for they are desolate for lack of men; they heard not the sound of life from the birds of the sky, nor the cattle: they were amazed, they are gone.  <span class="verse" rel="v0249  011" id="9  011" >11</span>
 And I will remove the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and make it a dwelling-place of dragons; and I will utterly waste the cities of Juda, so that they shall not be inhabited.  <span class="verse" rel="v0249  012" id="9  012" >12</span>
 Who is the wise man, that he may understand this? and he that has the word of the mouth of the Lord   addressed   to him, let him tell you therefore the land has been destroyed, has been ravaged by fire like a desert, so that no one passes through it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0249  013" id="9  013" >13</span>
 And the Lord said to me, Because they have forsaken my law, which I set before them, and have not listened to my voice;  <span class="verse" rel="v0249  014" id="9  014" >14</span>
 but went after the lusts of their evil heart, and after the idols which their fathers taught them   to worship  :  <span class="verse" rel="v0249  015" id="9  015" >15</span>
 therefore thus says the Lord God of Israel, Behold, I will feed them with trouble and will cause them to drink water of gall:  <span class="verse" rel="v0249  016" id="9  016" >16</span>
 and I will scatter them among the nations, to them whom neither they nor their fathers knew; and I will send a sword upon them, until I have consumed them with it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0249  017" id="9  017" >17</span>

 For a voice of lamentation has been heard in Sion, How are we become wretched! we are greatly ashamed, for we have forsaken the land, and have abandoned our tabernacles!  <span class="verse" rel="v0249  020" id="9  020" >20</span>
 Hear now, you° women, the word of God, and let your ears receive the words of his mouth, and teach your daughters lamentation, and   every   woman her neighbor a dirge.  <span class="verse" rel="v0249  021" id="9  021" >21</span>

 Behold, the days come, says the Lord, when I will visit upon all the circumcised their uncircumcision;  <span class="verse" rel="v0249  026" id="9  026" >26</span>
 on Egypt, and on Idumea, and on Edom, and on the children of Ammon, and on the children of Moab, and on every one that shaves his face round about,   even   them that dwell in the wilderness; for all the Gentiles are uncircumcised in flesh, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised   in   their hearts.

 Thus says the Lord, Learn you° not the ways of the heathen, and be not alarmed at the signs of the sky; for they are alarmed at them,   falling   on their faces.  <span class="verse" rel="v02410  003" id="10  003" >3</span>
 For the customs of the nations are vain; it is a tree cut out of the forest, the work of the carpenter, or a molten image.  <span class="verse" rel="v02410  004" id="10  004" >4</span>
    They are   beautified with silver and gold, they fix them with hammers and nails;  <span class="verse" rel="v02410  005" id="10  005" >5</span>
 they will set them up that they may not move; it is wrought silver, they will not walk, it is forged silver They must certainly be borne, for they can’t ride   of themselves  . Fear them not; for they can’t do any evil, and there is no good in them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02410  011" id="10  011" >11</span>

 It is the Lord that made the earth by his strength, who set up the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding stretched out the sky,  <span class="verse" rel="v02410  013" id="10  013" >13</span>
 and set abundance of waters in the sky, and brought up clouds from the ends of the earth; he made lightnings for the rain, and brought forth light out of his treasures.  <span class="verse" rel="v02410  014" id="10  014" >14</span>

 They are turned   aside   to the iniquities of their fathers that were of old, who would not listen to my words: and, behold, they go after strange gods, to serve them: and the house of Israel and the house of Juda have broken my covenant, which I made with their fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v02411  011" id="11  011" >11</span>

 Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek my life, that say, You shall not prophesy at all in the name of the Lord, but if you do, you shall die by our hands:  <span class="verse" rel="v02411  022" id="11  022" >22</span>
 behold, I will visit them: their young men shall die by the sword; and their sons and their daughters shall die of famine:  <span class="verse" rel="v02411  023" id="11  023" >23</span>
 and there shall be no remnant   left   of them; for I will bring evil upon the dwellers in Anathoth, in the year of their visitation.

<p><span class="chapter" id="12  001">12  </span> Righteous are you, O Lord, that I may make my defence to you, yes, I will speak to you   of   judgments. Why   is it   that the way of ungodly   men   prospers?   that   all that deal very treacherously are flourishing?  <span class="verse" rel="v02412  002" id="12  002" >2</span>
 You have planted them, and they have taken root; they have begotten children, and become fruitful; you are near to their mouth, and far from their reins.  <span class="verse" rel="v02412  003" id="12  003" >3</span>
 But you, Lord, know me; you have proved my heart before you; purify them for the day of their slaughter.  <span class="verse" rel="v02412  004" id="12  004" >4</span>
 How long shall the land mourn, and the grass of the field wither, for the wickedness of them, that dwell in it? the beasts and birds are utterly destroyed; because   the people   said, God shall not see our ways.  <span class="verse" rel="v02412  005" id="12  005" >5</span>
 Your feet run, and they cause you to faint; how will you prepare   to ride   upon horses? and you have been confident in the land of your peace? how will you do in the roaring of Jordan?  <span class="verse" rel="v02412  006" id="12  006" >6</span>
 For even your brethren and the house of your father, even these have dealt treacherously with you; and they have cried out, they are gathered together in pursuit of you; trust not you in them, though they shall speak fair   words   to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02412  007" id="12  007" >7</span>
 I have forsaken my house, I have left my heritage; I have given my beloved one into the hands of her enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v02412  008" id="12  008" >8</span>
 My inheritance has become to me as a lion in a forest; she has uttered her voice against me; therefore have I hated her.  <span class="verse" rel="v02412  009" id="12  009" >9</span>
 Is not my inheritance to me a hyaena's cave, or a cave round about her? Go you°, gather together all the wild beasts of the field, and let them come to devour her.  <span class="verse" rel="v02412  010" id="12  010" >10</span>
 Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have defiled my portion, they have made my desirable portion a trackless wilderness;  <span class="verse" rel="v02412  011" id="12  011" >11</span>
 it is made a complete ruin: for my sake the whole land has been utterly ruined, because there is none that lays   the matter   to heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v02412  012" id="12  012" >12</span>
 The ravagers are come to every passage in the wilderness: for the sword of the Lord will devour from one end of the land to the other: no flesh has any peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v02412  013" id="12  013" >13</span>
 Sow wheat, and reap thorns; their portions shall not profit them: be ashamed of your boasting, because of reproach before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02412  014" id="12  014" >14</span>
 For thus says the Lord, concerning all the evil neighbors that touch my inheritance, which I have divided to my people Israel; Behold, I   will   draw them away from their land, and I will cast out Juda from the midst of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02412  015" id="12  015" >15</span>
 And it shall come to pass, after I have cast them out,   that   I will return, and have mercy upon them, and will cause them to dwell every one in his inheritance, and every one in his land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02412  016" id="12  016" >16</span>
 And it shall be, if they will indeed learn the way of my people, to swear by my name,   saying  , The Lord lives; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall   that nation   be built in the midst of my people.  <span class="verse" rel="v02412  017" id="12  017" >17</span>
 But if they will not return, then will I cut off that nation with utter ruin and destruction.

<p><span class="chapter" id="13  001">13  </span> Thus says the Lord, Go and procure for yourself a linen girdle, and put it about your loins, and let it not be put in water.  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  002" id="13  002" >2</span>
 So I procured the girdle according to the word of the Lord, and put it about my loins.  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  003" id="13  003" >3</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  004" id="13  004" >4</span>
 Take the girdle that is upon your loins, and arise, and go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  005" id="13  005" >5</span>
 So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as the Lord commanded me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  006" id="13  006" >6</span>
 And it came to pass after many days, that the Lord said to me, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take thence the girdle, which I commanded you to hide there.  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  007" id="13  007" >7</span>
 So I went to the river Euphrates, and dug, and took the girdle out of the place where I   had   buried it: and, behold, it was rotten, utterly good for nothing.  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  008" id="13  008" >8</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Thus says the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  009" id="13  009" >9</span>
 Thus will I mar the pride of Juda, and the pride of Jerusalem;  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  010" id="13  010" >10</span>
    even   this great pride   of the men   that will not listen to my words, and have gone after strange gods, to serve them, and to worship them: and they shall be as this girdle, which can be used for nothing.  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  011" id="13  011" >11</span>
 For as a girdle cleaves about the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave to myself the house of Israel, and the whole house of Juda; that they might be to me a famous people, and a praise, and a glory: but they did not listen to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  012" id="13  012" >12</span>
 And you shall say to this people, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and it shall come to pass, if they shall say to you, Shall we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine? that you shall say to them,  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  013" id="13  013" >13</span>
 Thus says the Lord, Behold, I   will   fill the inhabitants of this land, and their kings the sons of David that sit upon their throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and Juda and all the dwellers in Jerusalem, with strong drink.  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  014" id="13  014" >14</span>
 And I will scatter them a man and his brother, and their fathers and their sons together: I will not have compassion, says the Lord, and I will not spare, neither will I pity   to save them   from destruction.  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  015" id="13  015" >15</span>
 Hear you°, and give ear, and be not proud: for the Lord has spoken.  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  016" id="13  016" >16</span>
 Give glory to the Lord your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains, and you° shall wait for light, and behold the shadow of death, and they shall be brought into darkness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  017" id="13  017" >17</span>
 But if you° will not listen, your soul shall weep in secret because of pride, and your eyes shall pour down tears, because the Lord's flock is sorely bruised.  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  018" id="13  018" >18</span>
 Say you° to the king and the princes, Humble yourselves, and sit down; for your crown of glory is removed from your head.  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  019" id="13  019" >19</span>
 The cities toward the south were shut, and there was none to open   them  : Juda is removed   into captivity,   they have suffered a complete removal.  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  020" id="13  020" >20</span>
 Lift up your eyes, O Jerusalem, and behold them that come from the north; where is the flock that was given you, the sheep of your glory?  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  021" id="13  021" >21</span>
 What will you say when they shall visit you, for you did teach them lessons for rule against yourself; shall not pangs seize you as a woman in travail?  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  022" id="13  022" >22</span>
 And if you should say in your heart, Therefore have these things happened to me? Because of the abundance of your iniquity have your skirts been discovered, that your heels might be exposed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  023" id="13  023" >23</span>
 If the Ethiopian shall change his skin, or the leopardess her spots, then shall you° be able to do good, having learned evil.  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  024" id="13  024" >24</span>
 So I scattered them as sticks carried by the wind into the wilderness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  025" id="13  025" >25</span>
 Thus is your lot, and the reward of your disobedience to me, says the Lord; as you did forget me, and trust in lies,  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  026" id="13  026" >26</span>
 I also will expose your skirts upon your face, and your shame shall be seen;  <span class="verse" rel="v02413  027" id="13  027" >27</span>
 your adultery also, and your neighing, and the looseness of your fornication: on the hills and in the fields I have seen your abominations. Woe to you, O Jerusalem, for you have not been purified so as to follow me; how long yet   shall it be  ?

<p><span class="chapter" id="14  001">14  </span> AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEREMIAS CONCERNING THE DROUGHT.  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  002" id="14  002" >2</span>
 Judea has mourned, and her gates are emptied, and are darkened upon the earth; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  003" id="14  003" >3</span>
 And her nobles have sent their little ones to the water: they came to the wells, and found no water: and brought back their vessels empty.  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  004" id="14  004" >4</span>
 And the labors of the land failed, because there was no rain: the husbandmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  005" id="14  005" >5</span>
 And hinds calved in the field, and forsook   it  , because there was no grass.  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  006" id="14  006" >6</span>
 The wild asses stood by the forests, and snuffed up the wind; their eyes failed, because there was no grass.  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  007" id="14  007" >7</span>
 Our sins have risen up against us: O Lord, do you for us for your own sake; for our sins are many before you; for we have sinned against you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  008" id="14  008" >8</span>
 O Lord,   you are   the hope of Israel, and deliver   us   in time of troubles; why are you become as a sojourner upon the land, or as one born in the land, yet turning aside for a resting-place?  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  009" id="14  009" >9</span>
 Will you be as a man asleep, or as a   strong   man that can’t save? yet you are among us, O Lord, and your name is called upon us; forget us not.  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  010" id="14  010" >10</span>
 Thus says the Lord to this people, They have loved to wander, and they have not spared, therefore God has not prospered them; now will he remember their iniquity.  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  011" id="14  011" >11</span>
 And the Lord said to me, Pray not for this people for   their   good:  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  012" id="14  012" >12</span>
 for though they fast, I will not hear their supplication; and though they offer whole burnt offerings and sacrifices, I will take no pleasure in them: for I will consume them with sword, and with famine, and with pestilence.  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  013" id="14  013" >13</span>
 And I said, O   ever   living Lord! behold, their prophets prophesy, and say, You° shall not see a sword, nor shall famine be among you; for I will give truth and peace on the land, and in this place.  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  014" id="14  014" >14</span>
 Then the Lord said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, and I commanded them not, and I spoke not to them: for they prophesy to you false visions, and divinations, and auguries, and devices of their own heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  015" id="14  015" >15</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the prophets that prophesy lies in my name, and I sent them not, who say, Sword and famine shall not be upon this land; they shall die by a grievous death, and the prophets shall be consumed by famine.  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  016" id="14  016" >16</span>
 And the people to whom they prophesy, they also shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, because of the sword and famine; and there shall be none to bury them: their wives also, and their sons, and their daughters   shall die thus  ; and I will pour out their wickedness upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  017" id="14  017" >17</span>
 And you shall speak this word to them; Let your eyes shed tears day and night, and let them not cease: for the daughter of my people has been sorely bruised, and her plague is very grievous.  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  018" id="14  018" >18</span>
 If I go forth into the plain, then behold the slain by the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold the distress of famine! for priest and prophet have gone to a land which they knew not.  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  019" id="14  019" >19</span>
 Hast you utterly rejected Juda? and has your soul departed from Sion? therefore has you struck us, and there is no healing for us? we waited for peace, but there was no prosperity; for a time of healing, and behold trouble!  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  020" id="14  020" >20</span>
 We know, O Lord, our sins,   and   the iniquities of our fathers: for we have sinned before you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  021" id="14  021" >21</span>
 Refrain for your name's sake, destroy not the throne of your glory: remember, break not your covenant with us.  <span class="verse" rel="v02414  022" id="14  022" >22</span>
 Is there any one among the idols of the Gentiles that can give rain? and will the sky yield his fulness   at their bidding  ? Are not you he? we will even wait on you, O Lord: for you have made all these things.

<p><span class="chapter" id="15  001">15  </span> And the Lord said to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before my face, my soul could not be toward them: dismiss this people, and let them go forth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02415  002" id="15  002" >2</span>
 And it shall be, if they say to you, Whither shall we go forth? then you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord; As many as are for death, to death; and as many as are for famine, to famine; and as many as are for the sword, to the sword; and as many as are for captivity, to captivity.  <span class="verse" rel="v02415  003" id="15  003" >3</span>
 And I will punish them with four kinds   of death  , says the Lord, the sword to kill, and the dogs to tear, and the wild beasts of the earth, and the birds of the sky to devour and destroy.  <span class="verse" rel="v02415  004" id="15  004" >4</span>
 And I will deliver them up for distress to all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasses son of Ezekias king of Juda, for all that he did in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v02415  005" id="15  005" >5</span>
 Who will spare you, O Jerusalem? and who will fear for you? or who will turn back   to ask   for your welfare?  <span class="verse" rel="v02415  006" id="15  006" >6</span>
 You have turned away from me, says the Lord, you will go back: therefore I will stretch out my hand, and will destroy you, and will no more spare them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02415  007" id="15  007" >7</span>
 And I will completely scatter them; in the gates of my people they are bereaved of children: they have destroyed my people because of their iniquities.  <span class="verse" rel="v02415  008" id="15  008" >8</span>
 Their widows have been multiplied more than the sand of the sea: I have brought young men against the mother,   even   distress at noon-day: I have suddenly cast upon her trembling and anxiety.  <span class="verse" rel="v02415  009" id="15  009" >9</span>
 She that bore seven is spent; her soul has fainted under trouble; her sun is gone down while it is yet noon; she is ashamed and disgraced: I will give the remnant of them to the sword before their enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v02415  010" id="15  010" >10</span>
 Woe is me,   my   mother! you have born me as some man of strife, and at variance with the whole earth; I have not helped   others  , nor has any one helped me; my strength has failed among them that curse me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02415  011" id="15  011" >11</span>
 Be it so, Lord, in their prosperity; surely I stood before you in the time of their calamities, and in the time of their affliction, for   their   good against the enemy.  <span class="verse" rel="v02415  012" id="15  012" >12</span>
 Will iron be known? whereas your strength is a brazen covering.  <span class="verse" rel="v02415  013" id="15  013" >13</span>

 And I will enslave you to your enemies round about, in a land which you have not known; for a fire has been kindled out of my wrath; it shall burn upon you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02415  015" id="15  015" >15</span>
 O Lord, remember me, and visit me, and vindicate me before them that persecute me; do not bear long with them; know how I have met with reproach for your sake, from those who set at nothing your words;  <span class="verse" rel="v02415  016" id="15  016" >16</span>
 consume them; and your word shall be to me for the joy and gladness of my heart: for your name has been called upon me, O Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v02415  017" id="15  017" >17</span>
 I have not sat in the assembly of them as they mocked, but I feared because of your power: I sat alone, for I was filled with bitterness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02415  018" id="15  018" >18</span>
 Why do they that grieve me prevail against me? my wound is severe; whence shall I be healed? it is indeed become to me as deceitful water, that has no faithfulness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02415  019" id="15  019" >19</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord, If you will return, then will I restore you, and you shall stand before my face: and if you will bring forth the precious from the worthless, you shall be as my mouth: and they shall return to you; but you shall not return to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02415  020" id="15  020" >20</span>
 And I will make you to this people as a strong brazen wall; and they shall fight against you, but they shall by no means prevail against you;  <span class="verse" rel="v02415  021" id="15  021" >21</span>

 and there shall be no son born to you, nor daughter in this place.  <span class="verse" rel="v02416  003" id="16  003" >3</span>
 For thus says the Lord concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that have born them, and concerning their fathers that have begotten them in this land;  <span class="verse" rel="v02416  004" id="16  004" >4</span>
 They shall die of grievous death; they shall not be lamented, nor buried; they shall be for an example on the face of the earth; and they shall be for the wild beasts of the land, and for the birds of the sky: they shall fall by the sword, and shall be consumed with famine.  <span class="verse" rel="v02416  005" id="16  005" >5</span>
 Thus says the Lord, Enter not into their mourning feast, and go not to lament, and mourn not for them: for I have removed my peace from this people.  <span class="verse" rel="v02416  006" id="16  006" >6</span>
 They shall not bewail them, nor make cuttings for them, and they shall not shave themselves   for them  :  <span class="verse" rel="v02416  007" id="16  007" >7</span>

 You shall not enter into the banquet-house, to sit with them to eat and to drink.  <span class="verse" rel="v02416  009" id="16  009" >9</span>
 For thus says the Lord God of Israel; Behold, I   will   make to cease out of this place before your eyes, and in your days, the voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.  <span class="verse" rel="v02416  010" id="16  010" >10</span>
 And it shall come to pass, when you shall report to this people all these words, and they shall say to you, Therefore has the Lord pronounced against us all these evils? what is our unrighteousness? and what is our sin which we have sinned before the Lord our God?  <span class="verse" rel="v02416  011" id="16  011" >11</span>
 Then you shall say to them, Because your fathers forsook me, says the Lord, and went after strange gods and served them, and worshipped them, and forsook me, and kept not my law;  <span class="verse" rel="v02416  012" id="16  012" >12</span>

 Therefore, behold, the days come, says the Lord, when they shall no more say, The Lord lives, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;  <span class="verse" rel="v02416  015" id="16  015" >15</span>
 but, The Lord lives, who brought up the house of Israel from the land of the north, and from all countries whither they were thrust out: and I will restore them to their own land, which I gave to their fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v02416  016" id="16  016" >16</span>
 Behold, I   will   send many fishers, says the Lord, and they shall fish them; and afterward I will send many hunters, and they shall hunt them upon every mountain, and upon every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.  <span class="verse" rel="v02416  017" id="16  017" >17</span>
 For my eyes are upon all their ways; and their iniquities have not been hidden from my eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v02416  018" id="16  018" >18</span>
 And I will recompense their mischiefs doubly, and their sins, whereby they have profaned my land with the carcases of their abominations, and with their iniquities, whereby they have trespassed against my inheritance.  <span class="verse" rel="v02416  019" id="16  019" >19</span>
 O Lord, you are my strength, and my help, and my refuge in days of evil: to you the Gentiles shall come from the end of the earth, and shall say, How vain   were the   idols   which   our fathers procured to themselves, and there is no help in them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02416  020" id="16  020" >20</span>
 Will a man make gods for himself, whereas these are no gods?  <span class="verse" rel="v02416  021" id="16  021" >21</span>
 Therefore, behold, I will at this time manifest my hand to them, and will make known to them my power; and they shall know that my name is the Lord.

 And he shall be as the wild tamarisk in the desert: he shall not see when good comes; but he shall dwell in barren   places  , and in the wilderness, in a salt land which is not inhabited.  <span class="verse" rel="v02417  007" id="17  007" >7</span>

 Behold, they say to me, Where is the word of the Lord? let it come.  <span class="verse" rel="v02417  016" id="17  016" >16</span>
 But I have not been weary of following you, nor have I desired the day of man; you know; the   words   that proceed out of my lips are before your face.  <span class="verse" rel="v02417  017" id="17  017" >17</span>

 And   men   shall come out of the cities of Juda, and from round about Jerusalem, and out of the land of Benjamin, and out of the plain country, and from the hill country, and from the south   country  , bringing whole burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and incense, and manna, and frankincense, bringing praise to the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02417  027" id="17  027" >27</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="18  001">18  </span> The word that came from the Lord to  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  002" id="18  002" >2</span>
 Jeremias, saying, Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there you shall hear my words.  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  003" id="18  003" >3</span>
 So I went down to the potter's house, and behold, he was making a vessel on the stones.  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  004" id="18  004" >4</span>
 And the vessel which he was making with his hands fell: so he made it again another vessel, as it seemed good to him to make   it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  005" id="18  005" >5</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  006" id="18  006" >6</span>
 Shall I not be able, O house of Israel, to do to you as this potter? behold, as the clay of the potter are you° in my hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  007" id="18  007" >7</span>
    If   I shall pronounce a decree upon a nation, or upon a kingdom, to cut them off, and to destroy   them  ;  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  008" id="18  008" >8</span>
 and that nation turn from all their sins, then will I repent of the evils which I purposed to do to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  009" id="18  009" >9</span>
 And   if   I shall pronounce a decree upon a nation and kingdom, to rebuild and to plant   it  ;  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  010" id="18  010" >10</span>
 and they do evil before me, so as not to listen to my voice, then will I repent of the good which I spoke of, to do it to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  011" id="18  011" >11</span>
 And now say to the men of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Behold, I prepare evils against you, and devise a device against you: let every one turn now from his evil way, and amend your practices.  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  012" id="18  012" >12</span>
 And they said, We will quit ourselves like men, for we will pursue our perverse ways, and we will perform each the lusts of his evil heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  013" id="18  013" >13</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord; Enquire now among the nations, who has heard such very horrible things as the virgin of Israel has done?  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  014" id="18  014" >14</span>
 Will fertilising streams fail   to flow   from a rock, or snow   fail   from Libanus? will water violently impelled by the wind turn aside?  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  015" id="18  015" >15</span>
 For my people have forgotten me, they have offered incense in vain, and they fail in their ways,   leaving   the ancient tracks, to enter upon impassable paths;  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  016" id="18  016" >16</span>
 to make their land a desolation, and a perpetual hissing; all that go through it shall be amazed, and shall shake their heads.  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  017" id="18  017" >17</span>
 I will scatter them before their enemies like an east wind; I will show them the day of their destruction.  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  018" id="18  018" >18</span>
 Then they said, Come, and let us devise a device against Jeremias; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us strike him with the tongue, and we will hear all his words.  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  019" id="18  019" >19</span>
 Hear me, O Lord, and hear the voice of my pleading.  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  020" id="18  020" >20</span>
 Forasmuch as evil is rewarded for good; for they have spoken words against my soul, and they have hidden the punishment they   meant   for me; remember that I stood before your face, to speak good for them, to turn away your wrath from them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  021" id="18  021" >21</span>
 Therefore do you deliver their sons to famine, and gather them to the power of the sword: let their women be childless and widows; and let their men be cut off by death, and their young men fall by the sword in war.  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  022" id="18  022" >22</span>
 Let there be a cry in their houses: you shall bring upon them robbers suddenly: for they have formed a plan to take me, and have hidden snares for me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02418  023" id="18  023" >23</span>
 And you, Lord, know all their deadly counsel against me: account not their iniquities guiltless, and blot not out their sins from before you: let their weakness come before you; deal with them in the time of your wrath.

<p><span class="chapter" id="19  001">19  </span> Then said the Lord to me, Go and get an earthen bottle, the work of the potter, and you shall bring   some   of the elders of the people, and of the priests;  <span class="verse" rel="v02419  002" id="19  002" >2</span>
 and you shall go forth to the burial-place of the sons of their children, which is at the entrance of the gate of Charsith; and do you read there all these words which I shall speak to you:  <span class="verse" rel="v02419  003" id="19  003" >3</span>
 and you shall say to them, Hear you° the word of the Lord, you° kings of Juda, and men of Juda, and the dwellers in Jerusalem, and they that enter in by these gates; thus says the Lord God of Israel; Behold, I   will   bring evil upon this place, so that the ears of every one that hears it shall tingle.  <span class="verse" rel="v02419  004" id="19  004" >4</span>
 Because they forsook me, and profaned this place, and burnt incense in it to strange gods, which they and their fathers knew not; and the kings of Juda have filled this place with innocent blood,  <span class="verse" rel="v02419  005" id="19  005" >5</span>
 and built high places for Baal, to burn their children in the fire, which things I commanded not, neither did I design   them   in my heart:  <span class="verse" rel="v02419  006" id="19  006" >6</span>
 Therefore, behold, the days come, says the Lord, when this place shall no more be called, The fall and burial-place of the son of Ennom, but, The burial-place of slaughter.  <span class="verse" rel="v02419  007" id="19  007" >7</span>
 And I will destroy the counsel of Juda and the counsel of Jerusalem in this place; and I will cast them down with the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and I will give their dead bodies for food to the birds of the sky and to the wild beasts of the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02419  008" id="19  008" >8</span>
 And I will bring this city to desolation and   make it   a hissing; every one that passes by it shall scowl, and hiss because of all her plague.  <span class="verse" rel="v02419  009" id="19  009" >9</span>
 And they shall eat the flesh of their sons, and the flesh of their daughters; and they shall eat every one the flesh of his neighbor in the blockade, and in the siege wherewith their enemies shall besiege them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02419  010" id="19  010" >10</span>
 And you shall break the bottle in the sight of the men that go forth with you,  <span class="verse" rel="v02419  011" id="19  011" >11</span>
 and you shall say, Thus says the Lord, Thus will I break in pieces this people, and this city, even as an earthen vessel is broken in pieces which can’t be mended again.  <span class="verse" rel="v02419  012" id="19  012" >12</span>
 Thus will I do, says the Lord, to this place, and to the inhabitants of it, that this city may be given up, as one that is falling to ruin.  <span class="verse" rel="v02419  013" id="19  013" >13</span>
 And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Juda shall be as a ruinous place, because of their uncleannesses in all the houses, wherein they burnt incense upon their roofs to all the host of heaven, and poured drink-offerings to strange gods.  <span class="verse" rel="v02419  014" id="19  014" >14</span>
 And Jeremias came from   the place   of the Fall, whither the Lord had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the Lord's house: and said to all the people, Thus says the Lord;  <span class="verse" rel="v02419  015" id="19  015" >15</span>
 Behold I bring upon this city, and upon all the cities belonging to it, and upon the villages of it, all the evils which I have spoken against it, because they have hardened their neck,   that they might not   listen to my commands.  
<!-- 20   015 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="20  001">20  </span> Now Paschor the son of Emmer, the priest, who also had been appointed chief of the house of the Lord, heard Jeremias prophesying these words.  <span class="verse" rel="v02420  002" id="20  002" >2</span>
 And he struck him, and cast him into the dungeon which was by the gate of the upper house that was set apart, which was by the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02420  003" id="20  003" >3</span>
 And Paschor brought Jeremias out of the dungeon: and Jeremias said to him,   The Lord   has not called your name Paschor, but Exile.  <span class="verse" rel="v02420  004" id="20  004" >4</span>
 For thus says the Lord, Behold, I   will   give you up to captivity with all your friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes shall see   it  : and I will give you and all Juda into the hands of the king of Babylon, and they shall carry them captives, and cut them in pieces with swords.  <span class="verse" rel="v02420  005" id="20  005" >5</span>
 And I will give all the strength of this city, and all the labors of it, and all the treasures of the king of Juda, into the hands of his enemies, and they shall bring them to Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02420  006" id="20  006" >6</span>
 And you and all the dwellers in your house shall go into captivity: and you shall die in Babylon, and there you and all your friends shall be buried, to whom you have prophesied lies.  <span class="verse" rel="v02420  007" id="20  007" >7</span>
 You have deceived me, O Lord, and I have been deceived: you have been strong, and has prevailed: I am become a laughing stock, I am continually mocked every day.  <span class="verse" rel="v02420  008" id="20  008" >8</span>
 For I will laugh with my bitter speech, I will call upon rebellion and misery: for the word of the Lord is become a reproach to me and a mockery all my days.  <span class="verse" rel="v02420  009" id="20  009" >9</span>
 Then I said, I will by no means name the name of the Lord, and I will no more at all speak in his name. But it was a burning fire flaming in my bones, and I am utterly weakened on all sides, and can’t bear   up  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02420  010" id="20  010" >10</span>
 For I have heard the reproach of many gathering round,   saying  , Conspire you°, and let us conspire together against him,   even   all his friends: watch his intentions, if perhaps he shall be deceived, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall be avenged on him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02420  011" id="20  011" >11</span>
 But the Lord was with me as a mighty man of war: therefore they persecuted   me  , but could not perceive   anything against me  ; they were greatly confounded, for they perceived not their disgrace, which shall never be forgotten.  <span class="verse" rel="v02420  012" id="20  012" >12</span>
 O Lord, that prove just   deeds  , understanding the reins and hearts, let me see your vengeance upon them: for to you I have revealed my cause.  <span class="verse" rel="v02420  013" id="20  013" >13</span>
 Sing you° to the Lord, sing praise to him: for he has rescued the soul of the poor from the hand of evil-doers.  <span class="verse" rel="v02420  014" id="20  014" >14</span>
 Cursed be the day wherein I was born: the day wherein my mother brought me forth, let it not be blessed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02420  015" id="20  015" >15</span>
 Cursed be the man who brought the glad tidings to my father, saying, A male child is born to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02420  016" id="20  016" >16</span>
 Let that man rejoice as the cities which the Lord overthrew in wrath, and repented not: let him hear crying in the morning, and loud lamentation at noon;  <span class="verse" rel="v02420  017" id="20  017" >17</span>
 because he killed me not in the womb, and my mother became not my tomb, and her womb always great with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02420  018" id="20  018" >18</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="21  001">21  </span> THE WORD THAT CAME FROM THE LORD TO JEREMIAS, WHEN KING SEDEKIAS SENT TO HIM PASCHOR THE SON OF MELCHIAS, AND SOPHONIAS SON OF BASAEAS, THE PRIEST, SAYING,  <span class="verse" rel="v02421  002" id="21  002" >2</span>
 Enquire of the Lord for us; for the king of Babylon has risen up against us; if the Lord will do according to all his wonderful works, and   the king   shall depart from us.  <span class="verse" rel="v02421  003" id="21  003" >3</span>
 And Jeremias said to them, Thus shall you° say to Sedekias king of Juda,  <span class="verse" rel="v02421  004" id="21  004" >4</span>
 Thus says the Lord; Behold, I   will   turn back the weapons of war wherewith you° fight against the Chaldeans that have besieged you from outside the wall, and I will gather them into the midst of this city.  <span class="verse" rel="v02421  005" id="21  005" >5</span>
 And I will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, with wrath and great anger.  <span class="verse" rel="v02421  006" id="21  006" >6</span>
 And I will strike all the dwellers in this city,   both   men and cattle, with grievous pestilence: and they shall die.  <span class="verse" rel="v02421  007" id="21  007" >7</span>
 And after this, thus says the Lord; I will give Sedekias king of Juda, and his servants, and the people that is left in this city from the pestilence, and from the famine, and from the sword, into the hands of their enemies, that seek their lives: and they shall cut them in pieces with the edge of the sword: I will not spare them, and I will not have compassion upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02421  008" id="21  008" >8</span>
 And you shall say to this people, Thus says the Lord; Behold, I have set before you the way of life, and the way of death.  <span class="verse" rel="v02421  009" id="21  009" >9</span>
 He that remains in this city shall die by the sword, and by famine: but he that goes forth to advance to the Chaldeans that have besieged you, shall live, and his life shall be to him for a spoil, and he shall live.  <span class="verse" rel="v02421  010" id="21  010" >10</span>
 For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good: it shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall consume it with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v02421  011" id="21  011" >11</span>
 O house of the king of Juda, hear you° the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02421  012" id="21  012" >12</span>

 But if you° will not perform these words, by myself have I sworn, says the Lord, that this house shall be   brought   to desolation.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  006" id="22  006" >6</span>
 For thus says the Lord concerning the house of the king of Juda; You are Galaad to me,   and   the head of Libanus:   yet   surely I will make you a desert,   even   cities that shall not be inhabited:  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  007" id="22  007" >7</span>
 and I will bring upon you a destroying man, and his axe: and they shall cut down your choice cedars, and cast   them   into the fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  008" id="22  008" >8</span>
 And nations shall pass through this city, and each shall say to his neighbor, Why has the Lord done thus to this great city?  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  009" id="22  009" >9</span>
 And they shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord their God, and worshipped strange gods, and served them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  010" id="22  010" >10</span>
 Weep not for the dead, nor lament for him: weep bitterly for him that goes away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  011" id="22  011" >11</span>
 For thus says the Lord concerning Sellem the son of Josias, who reigns in the place of Josias his father, who has gone forth out of this place; He shall not return there any more:  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  012" id="22  012" >12</span>
 but in that place whither I have carried him captive, there shall he die, and shall see this land no more.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  013" id="22  013" >13</span>
 He that builds his house not with justice, and his upper chambers not with judgment, who works by means of his neighbor for nothing, and will by no means give him his reward.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  014" id="22  014" >14</span>
 You have built for yourself a well-proportioned house, airy chambers, fitted with windows, and wainscoted with cedar, and painted with vermilion.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  015" id="22  015" >15</span>
 Shall you reign, because you are provoked with your father Achaz? they shall not eat, and they shall not drink: it is better for you to execute judgment and justice.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  016" id="22  016" >16</span>
 They understood not, they judged not the cause of the afflicted, nor the cause of the poor: is not this your not knowing me? says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  017" id="22  017" >17</span>
 Behold, your eyes are not good, nor your heart, but   they go   after your covetousness, and after the innocent blood to shed it, and after acts of injustice and slaughter, to commit them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  018" id="22  018" >18</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Joakim son of Josias, king of Juda, even concerning this man; they shall not bewail him,   saying  , Ah brother! neither shall they at all weep for him,   saying  , Alas Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  019" id="22  019" >19</span>
 He shall be buried with the burial of an ass; he shall be dragged roughly along and cast outside the gate of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  020" id="22  020" >20</span>
 Go up to Libanus, and cry; and utter your voice to Basan, and cry aloud to the extremity of the sea: for all your lovers are destroyed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  021" id="22  021" >21</span>
 I spoke to you on   occasion of   your trespass, but you said, I will not listen. This   has been   your way from your youth, you have not listened to my voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  022" id="22  022" >22</span>
 The wind shall tend all your shepherds, and your lovers shall go into captivity; for then shall you be ashamed and disgraced because of all your lovers.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  023" id="22  023" >23</span>
 O you that dwell in Libanus, making your nest in the cedars, you shall groan heavily, when pangs as of a travailing woman are come upon you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  024" id="22  024" >24</span>
    As   I live, says the Lord, though Jechonias son of Joakim king of Juda were indeed the seal upon my right hand, thence would I pluck you;  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  025" id="22  025" >25</span>
 and I will deliver you into the hands of them that seek your life, before whom you are afraid, into the hands of the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  026" id="22  026" >26</span>
 And I will cast forth you, and your mother that bore you, into a land where you were not born; and there you° shall die.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  027" id="22  027" >27</span>
 But they shall by no means return to the land which they long for in their souls.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  028" id="22  028" >28</span>
 Jechonias is dishonored as a good-for-nothing vessel; for he is thrown out and cast forth into a land which he knew not.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  029" id="22  029" >29</span>
 Land, land, hear the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02422  030" id="22  030" >30</span>
 Write you° this man an outcast: for there shall none of his seed at all grow up to sit on the throne of David,   or as   a prince yet in Juda.

<p><span class="chapter" id="23  001">23  </span> Woe to the shepherds that destroy and scatter the sheep of their pasture!  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  002" id="23  002" >2</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord against them that tend my people; You° have scattered my sheep, and driven them out, and you° have not visited them: behold, I   will   take vengeance upon you according to your evil practices.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  003" id="23  003" >3</span>
 And I will gather in the remnant of my people in every land, whither I have driven them out, and will set them in their pasture; and they shall increase and be multiplied.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  004" id="23  004" >4</span>
 And I will raise up shepherds to them, who shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be alarmed, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  005" id="23  005" >5</span>
 Behold, the days come, says the Lord, when I will raise up to David a righteous branch, and a king shall reign and understand, and shall execute judgment and righteousness on the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  006" id="23  006" >6</span>
 In his days both Juda shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell securely: and this is his name, which the Lord shall call him, Josedec among the prophets.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  007" id="23  007" >7</span>
 Therefore, behold, the days come, says the Lord, when they shall no more say, The Lord lives, who brought up the house of Israel out of the land of Egypt;  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  008" id="23  008" >8</span>
 but The Lord lives, who has gathered the whole seed of Israel from the north land, and from all the countries whither he   had   driven them out, and has restored them into their own land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  009" id="23  009" >9</span>
 My heart is broken within me; all my bones are shaken: I am become as a broken-down man, and as a man overcome with wine, because of the Lord, and because of the excellence of his glory.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  010" id="23  010" >10</span>
 For because of these things the land mourns; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up; and their course is become evil, and so   also   their strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  011" id="23  011" >11</span>
 For priest and prophet are defiled; and I have seen their iniquities in my house.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  012" id="23  012" >12</span>
 Therefore let their way be to them slippery and dark: and they shall be tripped up and fall in it: for I will bring evils upon them, in the year of their visitation.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  013" id="23  013" >13</span>
 And in the prophets of Samaria I have seen lawless deeds; they prophesied by Baal, and led my people Israel astray.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  014" id="23  014" >14</span>
 Also in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen horrible things: as they committed adultery, and walked in lies, and strengthened the hands of many, that they should not return each from his evil way: they are all become to me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrha.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  015" id="23  015" >15</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord; Behold, I will feed them with pain, and give them bitter water to drink: for from the prophets of Jerusalem has defilement gone forth   into   all the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  016" id="23  016" >16</span>
 Thus says the Lord Almighty, Listen not to the words of the prophets: for they frame a vain vision for themselves; they speak from their own heart, and not from the mouth of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  017" id="23  017" >17</span>
 They say to them that reject the word of the Lord, There shall be peace to you; and to all that walk after their own lusts, and to everyone that walks in the error of his heart, they have said, No evil shall come upon you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  018" id="23  018" >18</span>
 For who has stood in the counsel of the Lord, and seen his word? who has listened, and heard?  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  019" id="23  019" >19</span>
 Behold,   there is   an earthquake from the Lord, and anger proceeds to a convulsion, it shall come violently upon the ungodly.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  020" id="23  020" >20</span>
 And the Lord's wrath shall return no more, until he have accomplished it, and until he have established it, according to the purpose of his heart: at the end of the days they shall understand it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  021" id="23  021" >21</span>
 I sent not the prophets, yet they ran: neither spoke I to them, yet they prophesied.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  022" id="23  022" >22</span>
 But if they had stood in my counsel, and if they had listened to my words, then would they have turned my people from their evil practices.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  023" id="23  023" >23</span>
 I am a God near at hand, says the Lord, and not a God afar off.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  024" id="23  024" >24</span>
 Shall any one hide himself in secret places, and I not see him? Do I not fill heaven and earth? says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  025" id="23  025" >25</span>
 I have heard what the prophets say, what they prophesy in my name, saying falsely, I have seen a night vision.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  026" id="23  026" >26</span>
 How long shall   these things   be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, when they prophesy the purposes of their own heart?  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  027" id="23  027" >27</span>
 who devise that   men   may forget my law by their dreams, which they have told every one to his neighbor, as their fathers forgot my name in   the worship of   Baal.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  028" id="23  028" >28</span>
 The prophet who has a dream, let him tell his dream; and   he   in whom is my word   spoken   to him, let him tell my word truly: what is the chaff to the corn? so are my words, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  029" id="23  029" >29</span>
 Behold, are not my words as fire? says the Lord; and as an axe cutting the rock?  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  030" id="23  030" >30</span>
 Behold, I am therefore against the prophets, says the Lord God, that steal my words every one from his neighbor.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  031" id="23  031" >31</span>
 Behold, I am against the prophets that put forth prophecies of mere words, and slumber their sleep.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  032" id="23  032" >32</span>
 Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets that prophesy false dreams, and have not told them   truly  , and have caused my people to err by their lies, and by their errors; yet I sent them not, and commanded them not; therefore, they shall not profit this people at all.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  033" id="23  033" >33</span>
 And if this people, or the priest, or the prophet, should ask, What is the burden of the Lord? then you shall say to them, You° are the burden, and I will dash you down, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  034" id="23  034" >34</span>
    As for   the prophet, and the priests, and the people, who shall say, The burden of the Lord, I will even take vengeance on that man, and on his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  035" id="23  035" >35</span>
 Thus shall you° say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, What has the Lord answered? and, what has the Lord said?  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  036" id="23  036" >36</span>
 And do you° name no more the burden of the Lord; for his own word shall be a man's burden.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  037" id="23  037" >37</span>
 But therefore,   say you°  , has the Lord our God spoken?  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  038" id="23  038" >38</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord our God; Because you° have spoken this word, The burden of the Lord, and I sent to you, saying, you° shall not say, The burden of the Lord;  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  039" id="23  039" >39</span>
 therefore, behold, I   will   seize, and dash down you and the city which I gave to you and your fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v02423  040" id="23  040" >40</span>
 And I will bring upon you an everlasting reproach, and everlasting disgrace, which shall not be forgotten.

<p><span class="chapter" id="24  001">24  </span> The Lord showed me two baskets of figs, lying in front of the temple of the Lord, after Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried captive Jechonias son of Joakim king of Juda, and the princes, and the artificers, and the prisoners, and the rich men out of Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02424  002" id="24  002" >2</span>
 The one basket was   full   of very good figs, as the early figs; and the other basket was   full   of very bad figs, which could not be eaten, for their badness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02424  003" id="24  003" >3</span>
 And the Lord said to me, What see you, Jeremias? and I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, which can’t be eaten, for their badness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02424  004" id="24  004" >4</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02424  005" id="24  005" >5</span>
 Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel; As these good figs, so will I acknowledge the Jews that have been carried away captive, whom I have sent forth out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for good.  <span class="verse" rel="v02424  006" id="24  006" >6</span>
 And I will fix my eyes upon them for good, and I will restore them into this land for good: and I will build them up, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.  <span class="verse" rel="v02424  007" id="24  007" >7</span>
 And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the Lord: and they shall be to me a people, and I will be to them a God: for they shall turn to me with all their heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v02424  008" id="24  008" >8</span>
 And as the bad figs, which can’t be eaten, for their badness; thus says the Lord, So will I deliver Sedekias king of Juda, and his nobles, and the remnant of Jerusalem, them that are left in this land, and the dwellers in Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v02424  009" id="24  009" >9</span>
 And I will cause them to be dispersed into all the kingdoms of the earth, and they shall be for a reproach, and a proverb, and an   object of   hatred, and a curse, in every place whither I have driven them out.  <span class="verse" rel="v02424  010" id="24  010" >10</span>

 which he spoke to all the people of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02425  003" id="25  003" >3</span>
 In the thirteenth year of Josias, son of Amos, king of Juda, even until this day for three and twenty years, I have both spoken to you, rising early and speaking,  <span class="verse" rel="v02425  004" id="25  004" >4</span>
 and I sent to you my servants the prophets, sending them early; (but you° listened not, and listened not with your ears;) saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02425  005" id="25  005" >5</span>

 But you° listened not to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02425  008" id="25  008" >8</span>

 behold I   will   send and take a family from the north, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants of it, and against all the nations round about it, and I will make them utterly waste, and make them a desolation, and a hissing, and an everlasting reproach.  <span class="verse" rel="v02425  010" id="25  010" >10</span>
 And I will destroy from   among   them the voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the scent of ointment, and the light of a candle.  <span class="verse" rel="v02425  011" id="25  011" >11</span>
 And all the land shall be a desolation; and they shall serve among the Gentiles seventy years.  <span class="verse" rel="v02425  012" id="25  012" >12</span>
 And when the seventy years are fulfilled, I will take vengeance on that nation, and will make them a perpetual desolation.  <span class="verse" rel="v02425  013" id="25  013" >13</span>
 And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have spoken against it,   even   all things that are written in this book.  <span class="verse" rel="v02425  034" id="25  034" >34</span>

 Therefore has Apis fled from you? your choice calf has not remained; for the Lord has utterly weakened him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02426  016" id="26  016" >16</span>
 And your multitude has fainted and fallen; and each one said to his neighbor, Let us arise, and return into our country to our people, from the Grecian sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v02426  017" id="26  017" >17</span>
 Call you° the name of Pharao Nechao king of Egypt, Saon esbeie moed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02426  018" id="26  018" >18</span>
    As   I live, says the Lord God, he shall come as Itabyrion among the mountains, and as Carmel that is on the sea.  <span class="verse" rel="v02426  019" id="26  019" >19</span>
 O daughter of Egypt dwelling   at home  , prepare you stuff for removing: for Memphis shall be utterly desolate, and shall be called Woe, because there are no inhabitants in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02426  020" id="26  020" >20</span>
 Egypt is a fair heifer,   but   destruction from the north is come upon her.  <span class="verse" rel="v02426  021" id="26  021" >21</span>
 Also her hired   soldiers   in the midst of her are as fatted calves fed in her; for they also have turned, and fled with one accord: they stood not, for the day of destruction was come upon them, and the time of their retribution.  <span class="verse" rel="v02426  022" id="26  022" >22</span>
 Their voice is as   that   of a hissing serpent, for they go upon the sand; they shall come upon Egypt with axes, as men that cut wood.  <span class="verse" rel="v02426  023" id="26  023" >23</span>
 They shall cut down her forest, says the Lord, for   their number   can’t at all be conjectured, for it exceeds the locust in multitude, and they are innumerable.  <span class="verse" rel="v02426  024" id="26  024" >24</span>
 The daughter of Egypt is confounded; she is delivered into the hands of a people from the north.  <span class="verse" rel="v02426  025" id="26  025" >25</span>
 Behold, I   will   avenge Ammon her son upon Pharao, and upon them that trust in him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02426  027" id="26  027" >27</span>
 But fear not you, my servant Jacob, neither be you alarmed, Israel: for, behold, I will save you from afar, and your seed from their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be at ease, and sleep, and there shall be no one to trouble him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02426  028" id="26  028" >28</span>
 Fear not you, my servant Jacob, says the Lord; for I am with you: she   that was   without fear and in luxury, has been delivered up: for I will make a full end of every nation among whom I have thrust you forth; but I will not cause you to fail: yet will I chastise you in the way of judgment, and will not hold you entirely guiltless.

<p><span class="chapter" id="27  001">27  </span> THE WORD OF THE LORD WHICH HE SPOKE AGAINST BABYLON.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  002" id="27  002" >2</span>
 Proclaim you° among the Gentiles, and cause the tidings to be heard, and suppress   them   not: say you°, Babylon is taken, Belus is confounded; the fearless, the luxurious Maerodach is delivered up.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  003" id="27  003" >3</span>
 For a nation has come up against her from the north, he shall utterly ravage her land, and there shall be none to dwell in it, neither man nor beast.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  004" id="27  004" >4</span>
 In those days, and at that time, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Juda together; they shall proceed, weeping as they go, seeking the Lord their God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  005" id="27  005" >5</span>
 They shall ask the way till   they come to   Sion, for that way shall they set their face; and they shall come and flee for refuge to the Lord their God; for the everlasting covenant shall not be forgotten.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  006" id="27  006" >6</span>
 My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds thrust them out, they caused them to wander on the mountains: they went from mountain to hill, they forgot their resting-place.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  007" id="27  007" >7</span>
 All that found them consumed them: their enemies said, Let us not leave them alone, because they have sinned against the Lord: he that gathered their fathers   had   a pasture of righteousness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  008" id="27  008" >8</span>
 Flee you° out of the midst of Babylon, and from the land of the Chaldeans, and go forth, and be as serpents before sleep.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  009" id="27  009" >9</span>
 For, behold, I stir up against Babylon the gatherings of nations out of the land of the north; and they shall set themselves in array against her: thence shall she be taken, as the dart of an expert warrior shall not return empty.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  010" id="27  010" >10</span>
 And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  011" id="27  011" >11</span>
 Because you° rejoiced, and boasted,   while   plundering my heritage; because you° exulted as calves in the grass, and pushed with the horn as bulls.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  012" id="27  012" >12</span>
 Your mother is greatly ashamed; your mother that bore you for prosperity is confounded:   she is   the last of the nations, desolate,  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  013" id="27  013" >13</span>
 by reason of the Lord's anger: it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be all a desolation; and every one that passes through Babylon shall scowl, and they shall hiss at all her plague.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  014" id="27  014" >14</span>
 Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all you° that bend the bow; shoot at her, spare not your arrows,  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  015" id="27  015" >15</span>
 and prevail against her: her hands are weakened, her bulwarks are fallen, and her wall is broken down: for it is vengeance from God: take vengeance upon her; as she has done, do to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  016" id="27  016" >16</span>
 Utterly destroy seed out of Babylon,   and   him that holds a sickle in time of harvest: for fear of the Grecian sword, they shall return every one to his people, and every one shall flee to his own land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  017" id="27  017" >17</span>
 Israel is a wandering sheep; the lions have driven him out: the king of Assyria first devoured him, and afterward this king of Babylon   has gnawed   his bones.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  018" id="27  018" >18</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord; Behold, I   will   take vengeance on the king of Babylon, and upon his land, as I took vengeance on the king of Assyria.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  019" id="27  019" >19</span>
 And I will restore Israel to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and on mount Ephraim and in Galaad, and his soul shall be satisfied.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  020" id="27  020" >20</span>
 In those days, and at that time, they shall seek for the iniquity of Israel, and there shall be none; and for the sins of Juda, and they shall not be found: for I will be merciful to them that are left  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  021" id="27  021" >21</span>
 on the land, says the Lord. Go up against it roughly, and against them that dwell on it: avenge, O sword, and destroy utterly, says the Lord, and do according to all that I command you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  022" id="27  022" >22</span>
 A sound of war, and great destruction in the land of the Chaldeans!  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  023" id="27  023" >23</span>
 How is the hammer of the whole earth broken and crushed! How is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  024" id="27  024" >24</span>
 They shall come upon you, and you shall not know it, Babylon, that you will even be taken captive: you are found and taken, because you did resist the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  025" id="27  025" >25</span>
 The Lord has opened his treasury, and brought forth the weapons of his anger: for the Lord God   has   a work in the land of the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  026" id="27  026" >26</span>
 For her times are come: open you° her storehouses: search her as a cave, and utterly destroy her: let there be no remnant of her.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  027" id="27  027" >27</span>
 Dry you° up all her fruits, and let them go down to the slaughter: woe to them! for their day is come, and the time of their retribution.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  028" id="27  028" >28</span>
 A voice of men fleeing and escaping from the land of Babylon, to declare to Sion the vengeance   that comes   from the Lord our God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  029" id="27  029" >29</span>
 Summon many against Babylon,   even   every one that bends the bow: camp against her round about; let no one of her   people   escape: render to her according to her works; according to all that she has done, do to her: for she has resisted the Lord, the Holy God of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  030" id="27  030" >30</span>
 Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her warriors shall be cast down, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  031" id="27  031" >31</span>
 Behold, I am against you the haughty one, says the Lord: for your day is come, and the time of your retribution.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  032" id="27  032" >32</span>
 And your pride shall fail, and fall, and there shall be no one to set it up again: and I will kindle a fire in her forest, and it shall devour all things round about her.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  033" id="27  033" >33</span>
 Thus says the Lord; The children of Israel and the children of Juda have been oppressed: all they that have taken them captive have oppressed them together; for they would not let them go.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  034" id="27  034" >34</span>
 But their Redeemer is strong; the Lord Almighty is his name: he will enter into judgment with his adversaries, that he may destroy the earth;  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  035" id="27  035" >35</span>
 and he will sharpen a sword against the Chaldeans, and against the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her nobles and upon her wise men;  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  036" id="27  036" >36</span>
 a sword upon her warriors, and they shall be weakened: a sword upon their horses, and upon their chariots:  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  037" id="27  037" >37</span>
 a sword upon their warriors and upon the mixed people in the midst of her; and they shall be as women: a sword upon the treasures, and they shall be scattered upon her water,  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  038" id="27  038" >38</span>
 and they shall be ashamed: for it is a land of graven   images  ; and in the islands, where they boasted.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  039" id="27  039" >39</span>
 Therefore shall idols dwell in the islands, and the young of monsters shall dwell in it: it shall not be inhabited any more for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  040" id="27  040" >40</span>
 As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities bordering upon them, says the Lord: no man shall dwell there, and no son of man shall sojourn there.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  041" id="27  041" >41</span>
 Behold, a people comes from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be stirred up from the end of the earth; holding bow and dagger:  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  042" id="27  042" >42</span>
    the people   is fierce, and will have no mercy: their voices shall sound as the sea, they shall ride upon horses, prepared for war, like fire, against you, O daughter of Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  043" id="27  043" >43</span>
 The king of Babylon heard the sound of them, and his hands were enfeebled: anguish overcame him, pangs as of a woman in travail.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  044" id="27  044" >44</span>
 Behold, he shall come up as a lion from Jordan to Gaethan; for I will speedily drive them from her, and I will set all the youths against her: for who is like me? and who will resist me? and who is this shepherd who will stand before me?  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  045" id="27  045" >45</span>
 Therefore hear you° the counsel of the Lord, which he has taken against Babylon; and his devices, which he has devised upon the Chaldeans inhabiting   it  : surely lambs of their flock shall be destroyed: surely pasture shall be cut off from them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02427  046" id="27  046" >46</span>
 For at the sound of the taking of Babylon the earth shall quake, and a cry shall be heard among the nations.

 For Israel and Juda have not been forsaken of their God, of the Lord Almighty; whereas their land was filled with iniquity against the holy things of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02428  006" id="28  006" >6</span>
 Flee you° out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every one his soul: and be not overthrown in her iniquity; for it is the time of her retribution from the Lord; he is rendering to her a recompence.  <span class="verse" rel="v02428  007" id="28  007" >7</span>
 Babylon has been a golden cup in the Lord's hand, causing all the earth to be drunken: the nations have drunk of her wine; therefore they were shaken.  <span class="verse" rel="v02428  008" id="28  008" >8</span>
 And Babylon is fallen suddenly, and is broken to pieces: lament for her; take balm for her deadly wound, if by any means she may be healed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02428  009" id="28  009" >9</span>
 We tried to heal Babylon, but she was not healed: let us forsake her, and depart every one to his own country: for her judgment has reached to the heaven, it has mounted up to the stars.  <span class="verse" rel="v02428  010" id="28  010" >10</span>

 Therefore, behold, the days come, says the Lord, when I will take vengeance upon her graven   images  : and slain men shall fall in all her land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02428  053" id="28  053" >53</span>
 For though Babylon should go up as the heaven, and though she should strengthen her walls with her power, from me shall come they that shall destroy her, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02428  054" id="28  054" >54</span>
 A sound of a cry in Babylon, and great destruction in the land of the Chaldeans:  <span class="verse" rel="v02428  055" id="28  055" >55</span>
 for the Lord has utterly destroyed Babylon, and cut off from her the great voice sounding as many waters: he has consigned her voice to destruction.  <span class="verse" rel="v02428  056" id="28  056" >56</span>
 For distress has come upon Babylon, her warriors are taken, their bows are useless: for God recompenses them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02428  057" id="28  057" >57</span>
 The Lord recompenses, and will make her leaders and her wise men and her captains completely drunk, says the King, the Lord Almighty is his name.  <span class="verse" rel="v02428  058" id="28  058" >58</span>
 Thus says the Lord, The wall of Babylon was made broad, but it shall be completely broken down, and her high gates shall be burnt with fire; and the peoples shall not labor in vain, nor the nations fail in   their   rule.  <span class="verse" rel="v02428  059" id="28  059" >59</span>
 THE WORD WHICH THE LORD COMMANDED THE PROPHET JEREMIAS to say to Saraeas son of Nerias, son of Maasaeas, when he went from Sedekias king of Juda to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign. And Saraeas was over the bounties.  <span class="verse" rel="v02428  060" id="28  060" >60</span>
 And Jeremias wrote in a book all the evils which should come upon Babylon,   even   all these words that are written against Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02428  061" id="28  061" >61</span>
 And Jeremias said to Saraeas, When you are come to Babylon, and shall see and read all these words;  <span class="verse" rel="v02428  062" id="28  062" >62</span>
 then you shall say, O Lord God, you have spoken against this place, to destroy it, and that there should be none to dwell in it, neither man nor beast; for it shall be a desolation for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v02428  063" id="28  063" >63</span>
 And it shall come to pass, when you shall cease from reading this book, that you shall bind a stone upon it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates;  <span class="verse" rel="v02428  064" id="28  064" >64</span>
 and shall say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and not rise, because of the evils which I bring upon it.

<p><span class="chapter" id="29  001">29  </span> THUS SAITH THE LORD AGAINST THE PHILISTINES;  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  002" id="29  002" >2</span>
 Behold, waters come up from the north, and shall become a sweeping torrent, and it shall sweep away the land, and its fulness; the city, and them that dwell in it: and men shall cry and all that dwell in the land shall howl,  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  003" id="29  003" >3</span>
 at the sound of his rushing, at   the sound of   his hoofs, and at the rattling of his chariots, at the noise of his wheels: the fathers turned not to their children because of the weakness of their hands,  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  004" id="29  004" >4</span>
 in the day that is coming to destroy all the Philistines: and I will utterly destroy Tyre and Sidon and all the rest of their allies: for the Lord will destroy the remaining   inhabitants   of the islands.  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  005" id="29  005" >5</span>
 Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ascalon is cast away, and the remnant of the Enakim.  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  006" id="29  006" >6</span>
 How long will you strike, O sword of the Lord? how long will it be ere you are quiet? return into your sheath, rest, and be removed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  007" id="29  007" >7</span>
 How shall it be quiet, whereas the Lord has given it a commission against Ascalon, and against the regions on the sea-coast, to awake against the remaining   countries  ! CONCERNING IDUMEA, thus says the Lord; There is no longer wisdom in Thaeman, counsel has perished from the wise ones, their wisdom is gone,  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  008" id="29  008" >8</span>
 their place has been deceived. Dig deep for a dwelling, you° that inhabit Daedam, for he has wrought grievously: I brought trouble upon him in the time at which I visited him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  009" id="29  009" >9</span>
 For grape gatherers are come, who shall not leave you a remnant; as thieves by night, they shall lay their hand upon   your possessions  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  010" id="29  010" >10</span>
 For I have stripped Esau, I have uncovered their secret places; they shall have no power to hide themselves, they have perished   each   by the hand of his brother, my neighbor, and it is impossible  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  011" id="29  011" >11</span>
 for your fatherless one to be left to live, but I shall live, and the widows trust in me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  012" id="29  012" >12</span>
 For thus says the Lord; They who were not appointed to drink the cup have drunk   it  ; and you shall by no means be cleared:  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  013" id="29  013" >13</span>
 for by myself I have sworn, says the Lord, that you shall be in the midst of her an impassable   land  , and a reproach, and a curse; and all her cities shall be desert for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  014" id="29  014" >14</span>
 I have heard a report from the Lord, and he has sent messengers to the nations,   saying,   Assemble yourselves, and come against her; rise you° up to war.  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  015" id="29  015" >15</span>
 I have made you small among the nations, utterly contemptible among men.  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  016" id="29  016" >16</span>
 Your insolence has risen up against you, the fierceness of your heart has burst the holes of the rocks, it has seized upon the strength of a lofty hill; for as an eagle he set his nest on high: thence will I bring you down.  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  017" id="29  017" >17</span>
 And Idumea shall be a desert: every one that passes by shall hiss at it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  018" id="29  018" >18</span>
 As Sodom was overthrown and Gomorrha and they that sojourned in her, says the Lord Almighty, no man shall dwell there, nor shall any son of man inhabit there.  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  019" id="29  019" >19</span>
 Behold, he shall come up as a lion out of the midst of Jordan to the place of Aetham: for I will speedily drive them from it, and do you° set the young men against her: for who is like me? and who will withstand me? and who   is   this shepherd, who shall confront me?  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  020" id="29  020" >20</span>
 Therefore hear you° the counsel of the Lord, which he has framed against Idumea; and his device, which he has devised against the inhabitants of Thaeman: surely the least of the sheep shall be swept off; surely their dwelling shall be made desolate for them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  021" id="29  021" >21</span>
 For at the sound of their fall the earth was scared, and the cry of the sea was not heard.  <span class="verse" rel="v02429  022" id="29  022" >22</span>
 Behold, he shall look   upon her   as an eagle, and spread forth   his   wings over her strongholds; and the heart of the mighty men of Idumea shall be in that day as the heart of a woman in her pangs.

<p><span class="chapter" id="30  001">30  </span> CONCERNING THE SONS OF AMMON thus says the Lord, Are there no sons in Israel? or have they no one to succeed   them  ? therefore has Melchol inherited Galaad, and why shall their people dwell in their cities?  <span class="verse" rel="v02430  002" id="30  002" >2</span>
 Therefore, behold, the days come, says the Lord, when I will cause to be heard in Rabbath a tumult of wars; and they shall become a waste and ruined place, and her altars shall be burned with fire; then shall Israel succeed to his dominion.  <span class="verse" rel="v02430  003" id="30  003" >3</span>
 Howl, O Esebon, for Gai has perished; cry, you° daughters of Rabbath, gird yourselves with sackcloth, and lament; for Melchol shall go into banishment, his priests and his princes together.  <span class="verse" rel="v02430  004" id="30  004" >4</span>
 Why do you° exult in the plains of the Enakim, you haughty daughter, that trust in   your   treasures, that say, Who shall come in to me?  <span class="verse" rel="v02430  005" id="30  005" >5</span>
 Behold, I   will   bring terror upon you, says the Lord, from all the country round about you; and you° shall be scattered every one right before him, and there is none to gather you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02430  023" id="30  023" >23</span>
 CONCERNING DAMASCUS. Emath is brought to shame, and Arphath: for they have heard an evil report: they are amazed, they are angry, they shall be utterly unable to rest.  <span class="verse" rel="v02430  024" id="30  024" >24</span>
 Damascus is utterly weakened, she is put to flight; trembling has seized upon her.  <span class="verse" rel="v02430  025" id="30  025" >25</span>
 How has she not left my city, they have loved the village?  <span class="verse" rel="v02430  026" id="30  026" >26</span>
 Therefore shall the young men fall in your streets, and all your warriors shall fall, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02430  027" id="30  027" >27</span>
 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the streets of the son of Ader.  <span class="verse" rel="v02430  028" id="30  028" >28</span>
 CONCERNING KEDAR THE QUEEN OF THE PALACE, WHOM NABUCHODONOSOR KING OF BABYLON SMOTE, thus says the Lord; Arise you°, and go up to Kedar, and fill the sons of Kedem.  <span class="verse" rel="v02430  029" id="30  029" >29</span>
 They shall take their tents and their sheep, they shall take for themselves their garments, and all their baggage and their camels; and summon you° destruction against them from every side.  <span class="verse" rel="v02430  030" id="30  030" >30</span>
 Flee you°, dig very deep for a dwelling-place, you° that dwell in the palace; for the king of Babylon has framed a counsel, and devised a device against you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02430  031" id="30  031" >31</span>
 Rise up, and go up against a nation settled   and   dwelling at ease, who have no doors, nor bolts, nor bars,   who   dwell alone.  <span class="verse" rel="v02430  032" id="30  032" >32</span>
 And their camels shall be a spoil, and the multitude of their cattle shall be destroyed: and I will scatter them as chaff with every wind, having their hair cut about their foreheads, I will bring on their overthrow from all sides, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02430  033" id="30  033" >33</span>
 And the palace shall be a resting-place for ostriches, and desolate for ever: no man shall abide there, and no son of man shall dwell there.

<p><span class="chapter" id="31  001">31  </span> Thus has the Lord said concerning MOAB, Woe to Nabau! for it has perished: Cariathaim is taken: Amath and Agath are put to shame.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  002" id="31  002" >2</span>
 There is no longer any healing for Moab,   nor   glorying in Esebon: he has devised evils against her: we have cut her off from   being   a nation, and she shall be completely still: after you shall go a sword;  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  003" id="31  003" >3</span>
 for   there is   a voice of   men   crying out of Oronaim, destruction and great ruin.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  004" id="31  004" >4</span>
 Moab is ruined, proclaim   it   to Zogora:  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  005" id="31  005" >5</span>
 for Aloth is filled with weeping: one shall go up weeping by the way of Oronaim; you° have heard a cry of destruction.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  006" id="31  006" >6</span>
 Flee you°, and save your lives, and you° shall be as a wild ass in the desert.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  007" id="31  007" >7</span>
 Since you have trusted in your strong-hold, therefore you shall be taken: and Chamos shall go forth into captivity, and his priests, and his princes together.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  008" id="31  008" >8</span>
 And destruction shall come upon every city, it shall by no means escape; the valley also shall perish, and the plain country shall be completely destroyed, as the Lord has said.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  009" id="31  009" >9</span>
 Set marks upon Moab, for she shall be touched with a plague-spot, and all her cities shall become desolate; whence   shall there be   an inhabitant for her?  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  010" id="31  010" >10</span>
 Cursed is the man that does the works of the Lord carelessly, keeping back his sword from blood.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  011" id="31  011" >11</span>
 Moab has been at ease from a child, and trusted in his glory; he has not poured out   his liquor   from vessel to vessel, and has not gone into banishment, therefore his taste remained in him, and his smell departed not.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  012" id="31  012" >12</span>
 Therefore, behold, his days come, says the Lord, when I shall send upon him bad leaders, and they shall lead him astray, and they shall utterly break in pieces his possessions, and shall cut his horns asunder.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  013" id="31  013" >13</span>
 And Moab shall be ashamed of Chamos, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Baethel their hope, having trusted in them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  014" id="31  014" >14</span>
 How will you° say, We are strong, and men strong for war?  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  015" id="31  015" >15</span>
 Moab is ruined,   even   his city, and his choice young men have gone down to slaughter.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  016" id="31  016" >16</span>
 The day of Moab is near at hand, and his iniquity moves swiftly   to vengeance  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  017" id="31  017" >17</span>
 Shake   the head   at him, all you° that are round about him; all   of you   utter his name; say you°, How is the glorious staff broken to pieces, the rod of magnificence!  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  018" id="31  018" >18</span>
 Come down from   your   glory, and sit down in a damp place: Daebon shall be broken, because Moab is destroyed: there has gone up against you one to ravage your strong-hold.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  019" id="31  019" >19</span>
 Stand by the way, and look, you that dwell in Arer; and ask him that is fleeing, and him that escapes, and say, What has happened?  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  020" id="31  020" >20</span>
 Moab is put to shame, because he is broken: howl and cry; proclaim in Arnon, that Moab has perished.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  021" id="31  021" >21</span>
 And judgment is coming against the land of Misor, upon Chelon, and Rephas, and Mophas,  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  022" id="31  022" >22</span>
 and upon Daebon, and upon Nabau, and upon the house of Daethlathaim,  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  023" id="31  023" >23</span>
 and upon Cariathaim, and upon the house of Gaemol, and upon the house of Maon,  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  024" id="31  024" >24</span>
 and upon Carioth, and upon Bosor, and upon all the cities of Moab, far and near.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  025" id="31  025" >25</span>
 The horn of Moab is broken, and his arm is crushed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  026" id="31  026" >26</span>
 Make you° him drunk; for he has magnified himself against the Lord: and Moab shall clap with his hand, and shall be also himself a laughing stock.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  027" id="31  027" >27</span>
 For surely Israel was to you a laughing stock, and was found among your thefts, because you did fight against him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  028" id="31  028" >28</span>
 The inhabitants of Moab have left the cities, and lived in rocks; they have become as doves nestling in rocks, at the mouth of a cave.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  029" id="31  029" >29</span>
 And I have heard of the pride of Moab, he has greatly heightened his pride and his haughtiness, and his heart has been lifted up.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  030" id="31  030" >30</span>
 But I know his works: is it not enough for him? has he not done thus?  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  031" id="31  031" >31</span>
 Therefore howl you° for Moab on all sides; cry out against the shorn men   in   a gloomy place. I will weep for you,  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  032" id="31  032" >32</span>
 O vine of Aserema, as with the weeping of Jazer: your branches are gone over the sea, they reached the cities of Jazer: destruction has come upon your fruits,   and   upon your grape gatherers.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  033" id="31  033" >33</span>
 Joy and gladness have been utterly swept off the land of Moab: and   though   there was wine in your presses, in the morning they trod it not, neither in the evening did they raise the cry of joy.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  034" id="31  034" >34</span>
 From the cry of Esebon even to Aetam their cities uttered their voice, from Zogor to Oronaim, and their tidings   as   a heifer of three years old, for the water also of Nebrin shall be dried up.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  035" id="31  035" >35</span>
 And I will destroy Moab, says the Lord, as he comes up to the altar, and burns incense to his gods.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  036" id="31  036" >36</span>
 Therefore the heart of Moab shall sound as pipes, my heart shall sound as a pipe for the shorn men; forasmuch as what   every   man has gained has perished from him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  037" id="31  037" >37</span>
 They shall all have their heads shaved in every place, and every beard shall be shaved; and all hands shall beat   the breasts  , and on all loins shall be sackcloth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  038" id="31  038" >38</span>
 And on all the housetops of Moab, and in his streets   shall be mourning  : for I have broken   him  , says the Lord, as a vessel, which is useless.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  039" id="31  039" >39</span>
 How has he changed! how has Moab turned   his   back! Moab is put to shame, and become a laughing stock, and an object of anger to all that are round about him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  040" id="31  040" >40</span>
 For thus said the Lord;  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  041" id="31  041" >41</span>
 Carioth is taken, and the strongholds have been taken together.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  042" id="31  042" >42</span>
 And Moab shall perish from being a multitude, because he has magnified himself against the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  043" id="31  043" >43</span>
 A snare, and fear, and the pit, are upon you, O inhabitant of Moab.  <span class="verse" rel="v02431  044" id="31  044" >44</span>
 He that flees from the terror shall fall into the pit, and he that comes up out of the pit shall even be taken in the snare: for I will bring these things upon Moab in the year of their visitation.

 So I took the cup out of the Lord's hand, and caused the nations to whom the Lord sent me to drink:  <span class="verse" rel="v02432  018" id="32  018" >18</span>
 Jerusalem, and the cities of Juda, and the kings of Juda, and his princes, to make them a desert place, a desolation, and a hissing;  <span class="verse" rel="v02432  019" id="32  019" >19</span>

 Thus said the Lord; Behold, evils are proceeding from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind goes forth from the end of the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02432  033" id="32  033" >33</span>
 And the slain of the Lord shall be in the day of the Lord from   one   end of the earth even to the   other   end of the earth: they shall not be buried; they shall be as dung on the face of the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02432  034" id="32  034" >34</span>
 Howl, you° shepherds, and cry; and lament, you° rams of the flock: for your days have been completed for slaughter, and you° shall fall as the choice rams.  <span class="verse" rel="v02432  035" id="32  035" >35</span>
 And flight shall perish from the shepherds, and safety from the rams of the flock.  <span class="verse" rel="v02432  036" id="32  036" >36</span>
 A voice of the crying of the shepherds, and a moaning of the sheep and the rams: for the Lord has destroyed their pastures.  <span class="verse" rel="v02432  037" id="32  037" >37</span>
 And the peaceful abodes that remain shall be destroyed before the fierceness of my anger.  <span class="verse" rel="v02432  038" id="32  038" >38</span>
 He has forsaken his lair, as a lion: for their land is become desolate before the great sword.

<p><span class="chapter" id="33  001">33  </span> IN THE BEGINNING OF THE REIGN OF KING JOAKIM SON OF JOSIAS THERE CAME THIS WORD FROM THE LORD.  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  002" id="33  002" >2</span>
 Thus said the Lord; Stand in the court of the Lord's house, and you shall declare to all the Jews, and to all that come to worship in the house of the Lord, all the words which I commanded you to speak to them; abate not one word.  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  003" id="33  003" >3</span>
 Peradventure they will hear, and turn every one from his evil way: then I will cease from the evils which I purpose to do to them, because of their evil practices.  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  004" id="33  004" >4</span>
 And you shall say, Thus said the Lord; If you° will not listen to me, to walk in my statutes which I set before you,  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  005" id="33  005" >5</span>
 to listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send to you early in the morning; yes, I sent them, but you° listened not to me;  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  006" id="33  006" >6</span>
 then will I make this house as Selo, and I will make   this   city a curse to all the nations of all the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  007" id="33  007" >7</span>
 And the priests, and the false prophets, and all the people heard Jeremias speaking these words in the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  008" id="33  008" >8</span>
 And it came to pass, when Jeremias had ceased speaking all that the Lord had ordered him to speak to all the people, that the priests and the false prophets and all the people took him, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  009" id="33  009" >9</span>
 You shall surely die, because you have prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying, This house shall be as Selo, and this city shall be made quite destitute of inhabitants. And all the people assembled against Jeremias in the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  010" id="33  010" >10</span>
 And the princes of Juda heard this word, and they went up out of the house of the king to the house of the Lord, and sat in the entrance of the new gate.  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  011" id="33  011" >11</span>
 Then the priests and the false prophets said to the princes and to all the people, The judgment of death   is due   to this man; because he has prophesied against this city, as you° have heard with your ears.  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  012" id="33  012" >12</span>
 Then Jeremias spoke to the princes, and to all the people, saying, The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city, all the words which you° have heard.  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  013" id="33  013" >13</span>
 And now amend your ways and your works, and listen to the voice of the Lord; and the Lord shall cease from the evils which he has pronounced against you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  014" id="33  014" >14</span>
 And behold, I am in your hands; do to me as is expedient, and as it is best for you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  015" id="33  015" >15</span>
 But know for a certainty, that if you° kill me, you° bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon them that dwell in it; for in truth the Lord has sent me to you to speak in your ears all these words.  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  016" id="33  016" >16</span>
 Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the false prophets; Judgment of death is not   due   to this man; for he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  017" id="33  017" >17</span>
 And there rose up men of the elders of the land, and said to all the assembly of the people,  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  018" id="33  018" >18</span>
 Michaeas the Morathite lived in the days of Ezekias king of Juda, and said to all the people of Juda, Thus says the Lord; Sion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become a desolation, and the mountain of the house shall be a thicket of trees.  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  019" id="33  019" >19</span>
 Did Ezekias and all Juda in any way kill him? Was it not that they feared the Lord, and they made supplication before the Lord, and the Lord ceased from the evils which he   had   pronounced against them? whereas we have wrought great evil against our own souls.  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  020" id="33  020" >20</span>
 And there was   another   man prophesying in the name of the Lord, Urias the son of Samaeas of Cariathiarim; and he prophesied concerning this land according to all the words of Jeremias.  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  021" id="33  021" >21</span>
 And king Joakim and all the princes heard all his words, and sought to kill him; and Urias heard   it   and went into Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  022" id="33  022" >22</span>
 And the king sent men into Egypt;  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  023" id="33  023" >23</span>
 and they brought him thence, and brought him into the king; and he struck him with the sword, and cast him into the sepulchre of the children of his people.  <span class="verse" rel="v02433  024" id="33  024" >24</span>
 Nevertheless the hand of Achicam son of Saphan was with Jeremias, to prevent his being delivered into the hands of the people, or being killed.

<p><span class="chapter" id="34  001">34  </span> Thus said the Lord; Make to yourself bonds and yokes, and put   them   about your neck,  <span class="verse" rel="v02434  003" id="34  003" >3</span>
 and you shall send them to the king of Idumea, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hands of their messengers that come to meet them at Jerusalem to Sedekias king of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v02434  004" id="34  004" >4</span>
 And you shall commission them to say to their lords, Thus said the Lord God of Israel; Thus shall you° say to your lords;  <span class="verse" rel="v02434  005" id="34  005" >5</span>
 I have made the earth by my great power, and with my high arm, and I will give it to whoever it shall seem   good   in my eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v02434  006" id="34  006" >6</span>
 I gave the earth to Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon to serve him, and the wild beasts of the field to labor for him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02434  008" id="34  008" >8</span>
 And the nation and kingdom, all that shall not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, with sword and famine will I visit them, says the Lord, until they are consumed by his hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v02434  009" id="34  009" >9</span>
 And listen you° not to your false prophets, nor to them that divine to you, nor to them that foretell events by dreams to you, nor to your auguries, nor your sorcerers, that say, You° shall by no means work for the king of Babylon:  <span class="verse" rel="v02434  010" id="34  010" >10</span>
 for they prophesy lies to you, to remove you far from your land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02434  011" id="34  011" >11</span>
 But the nation which shall put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, I will even leave it upon its land, and it shall serve him, and dwell in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02434  012" id="34  012" >12</span>
 I spoke also to Sedekias king of Juda according to all these words, saying, Put your neck into   the yoke  , and serve the king of Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02434  014" id="34  014" >14</span>
 For they prophesy unrighteous   words   to you,  <span class="verse" rel="v02434  015" id="34  015" >15</span>
 for I sent them not, says the Lord; and they prophesy   in   my name unjustly, that I might destroy you, and you° should perish, and your prophets, who unrighteously prophesy lies to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02434  016" id="34  016" >16</span>
 I spoke to you, and to all this people, and to the priests, saying, Thus said the Lord; Listen not to the words of the prophets that prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the Lord's house shall return from Babylon: for they prophesy to you unrighteous   words  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02434  017" id="34  017" >17</span>
 I sent them not.  <span class="verse" rel="v02434  018" id="34  018" >18</span>
 If they are prophets, and if the word of the Lord is in them, let them meet me, for thus has the Lord said.  <span class="verse" rel="v02434  019" id="34  019" >19</span>
 And as for the remaining vessels,  <span class="verse" rel="v02434  020" id="34  020" >20</span>
 which the king of Babylon took not, when he carried Jechonias prisoner out of Jerusalem,  <span class="verse" rel="v02434  022" id="34  022" >22</span>
 they shall go into Babylon, says the Lord.  
<!-- 35   022 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="35  001">35  </span> And it came to pass in the fourth year of Sedekias king of Juda, in the fifth month,   that   Ananias the false prophet, the son of Azor, from Gabaon, spoke to me in the house of the Lord, in the sight of the priests and all the people, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02435  002" id="35  002" >2</span>
 Thus says the Lord; I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02435  003" id="35  003" >3</span>
 Yet two full years, and I will return into this place the vessels of the house of the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v02435  004" id="35  004" >4</span>
 and Jechonias, and the captivity of Juda: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02435  005" id="35  005" >5</span>
 Then Jeremias spoke to Ananias in the sight of all the people, and in the sight of the priests that stood in the house of the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v02435  006" id="35  006" >6</span>
 and Jeremias said, May the Lord indeed do thus; may he confirm your word which you do prophesy, to return the vessels of the house of the Lord, and all the captivity, out of Babylon to this place.  <span class="verse" rel="v02435  007" id="35  007" >7</span>
 Nevertheless hear you° the word of the Lord which I speak in your ears, and in the ears of all the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v02435  008" id="35  008" >8</span>
 The prophets that were before me and before you of old, also prophesied over much country, and against great kingdoms, concerning war.  <span class="verse" rel="v02435  009" id="35  009" >9</span>
    As for   the prophet that has prophesied for peace, when the word has come   to pass  , they shall know the prophet whom the Lord has sent them in truth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02435  010" id="35  010" >10</span>
 Then Ananias took the yokes from the neck of Jeremias in the sight of all the people, and broke them to pieces.  <span class="verse" rel="v02435  011" id="35  011" >11</span>
 And Ananias spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus said the Lord; Thus will I break the yoke of the king of Babylon from the necks of all the nations. And Jeremias went his way.  <span class="verse" rel="v02435  012" id="35  012" >12</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, after that Ananias had broken the yokes off his neck, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02435  013" id="35  013" >13</span>
 Go and speak to Ananias, saying, Thus says the Lord; You have broken the yokes of wood; but I will make instead of them yokes of iron.  <span class="verse" rel="v02435  014" id="35  014" >14</span>
 For thus said the Lord, I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all the nations, that they may serve the king of Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02435  015" id="35  015" >15</span>
 And Jeremias said to Ananias, The Lord has not sent you; and you have caused this people to trust in unrighteousness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02435  016" id="35  016" >16</span>
 Therefore thus said the Lord: Behold, I   will   cast you off from the face of the earth: this year you shall die.  <span class="verse" rel="v02435  017" id="35  017" >17</span>
 So he died in the seventh month.

<p><span class="chapter" id="36  001">36  </span> And these are the words of the book which Jeremias sent from Jerusalem to the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, and to the false prophets, even an epistle to Babylon for the captivity, and to all the people;  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  002" id="36  002" >2</span>
 (after the departure of Jechonias the king and the queen, and the eunuchs, and every freeman, and bondman, and artificer, out of Jerusalem;)  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  003" id="36  003" >3</span>
 by the hand of Eleasan son of Saphan, and Gamarias son of Chelcias, (whom Sedekias king of Juda sent to the king of Babylon to Babylon) saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  004" id="36  004" >4</span>
 Thus said the Lord God of Israel concerning the captivity which I caused to be carried away from Jerusalem;  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  005" id="36  005" >5</span>
 Build you° houses, and inhabit   them  ; and plant gardens, and eat the fruits thereof;  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  006" id="36  006" >6</span>
 and take you° wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, and be multiplied, and be not diminished.  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  007" id="36  007" >7</span>
 And seek the peace of the land into which I have carried you captive, and you° shall pray to the Lord for the people: for in its peace you° shall   have   peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  008" id="36  008" >8</span>
 For thus says the Lord; Let not the false prophets that are among you persuade you, and let not your diviners persuade you, and listen not to your dreams which you° dream.  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  009" id="36  009" >9</span>
 For they prophesy to you unrighteous   words   in my name; and I sent them not.  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  010" id="36  010" >10</span>
 For thus said the Lord; When seventy years shall be on the point of being accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you, and will confirm my words to you, to bring back your people to this place.  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  011" id="36  011" >11</span>
 And I will devise for you a device of peace, and not evil, to bestow upon you these   good things  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  012" id="36  012" >12</span>
 And do you° pray to me, and I will listen to you: and do you° earnestly seek me, and you° shall find me;  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  013" id="36  013" >13</span>
 for you° shall seek me with your whole heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  014" id="36  014" >14</span>
 And I will appear to you:  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  015" id="36  015" >15</span>
 whereas you° said, The Lord has appointed for us prophets in Babylon:  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  021" id="36  021" >21</span>
 Thus says the Lord concerning Achiab, and concerning Sedekias; Behold, I   will   deliver them into the hands of the king of Babylon; and he shall strike them in your sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  022" id="36  022" >22</span>
 And they shall make of them a curse in all the captivity of Juda in Babylon, saying, The Lord do to you as he did to Sedekias, and as he did to Achiab, whom the king of Babylon fried in the fire;  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  023" id="36  023" >23</span>
 because of the iniquity which they wrought in Israel, and   because   they committed adultery with the wives of their fellow-citizens; and spoke a word in my name, which I did not command them   to speak  , and I am witness, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  024" id="36  024" >24</span>
 And to Samaeas the Aelamite you shall say,  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  025" id="36  025" >25</span>
 I sent you not in my name: and to Sophonias the priest the son of Maasaeas say you,  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  026" id="36  026" >26</span>
 The Lord has made you priest in the place of Jodae the priest, to be ruler in the house of the Lord over every prophet, and to every madman, and you shall put them in prison, and into the dungeon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  027" id="36  027" >27</span>
 And now therefore have you° reviled together Jeremias of Anathoth, who prophesied to you?  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  028" id="36  028" >28</span>
 Did he not send for this purpose? for in the course of this month he sent to you to Babylon, saying, It is far off: build you° houses, and inhabit   them  ; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  029" id="36  029" >29</span>
 And Sophonias read the book in the ears of Jeremias.  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  030" id="36  030" >30</span>
 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  031" id="36  031" >31</span>
 Send to the captivity, saying, Thus says the Lord concerning Samaeas the Aelamite, Since Samaeas has prophesied to you, and I sent him not, and he has made you to trust in iniquity,  <span class="verse" rel="v02436  032" id="36  032" >32</span>
 therefore thus says the Lord; Behold, I will visit Samaeas, and his family: and there shall not be a man of them in the midst of you to see the good which I will do to you: they shall not see   it  .

 Thus speaks the Lord God of Israel, saying, Write all the words which I have spoken to you in a book.  <span class="verse" rel="v02437  003" id="37  003" >3</span>
 For, behold, the days come, says the Lord, when I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel and Juda, said the Lord: and I will bring them back to the land which I gave to their fathers, and they shall be lords of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02437  004" id="37  004" >4</span>
 AND THESE ARE THE WORDS WHICH THE LORD SPOKE CONCERNING ISRAEL AND JUDA;  <span class="verse" rel="v02437  005" id="37  005" >5</span>
 Thus said the Lord: You° shall hear a sound of fear,   there is   fear, and there is not peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v02437  006" id="37  006" >6</span>
 Enquire, and see if a male has born a child? and   ask   concerning the fear, wherein they shall hold their loins, and   look for   safety: for I have seen every man, and his hands are on his loins;   their   faces are turned to paleness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02437  007" id="37  007" >7</span>
 For that day is great, and there is not such   another  ; and it is a time of straitness to Jacob; but he shall be saved out of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02437  008" id="37  008" >8</span>
 In that day, said the Lord, I will break the yoke off their neck, and will burst their bonds, and they shall no longer serve strangers:  <span class="verse" rel="v02437  009" id="37  009" >9</span>
 but they shall serve the Lord their God; and I will raise up to them David their king.  <span class="verse" rel="v02437  012" id="37  012" >12</span>
 Thus says the Lord; I have brought on   you   destruction; your stroke is painful.  <span class="verse" rel="v02437  013" id="37  013" >13</span>
 There is none to judge your cause: you have been painfully treated for healing, there is no help for you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02437  014" id="37  014" >14</span>
 All your friends have forgotten you; they shall not ask   about you   at all, for I have struck you with he stroke of an enemy,   even   severe correction: your sins have abounded above all your iniquity.  <span class="verse" rel="v02437  015" id="37  015" >15</span>
 Your sins have abounded beyond the multitude of your iniquities,   therefore   they have done these things to you. Therefore all that devour you shall be eaten, and all your enemies shall eat all their   own   flesh.  <span class="verse" rel="v02437  016" id="37  016" >16</span>
 And they that spoil you shall become a spoil, and I will give up to be plundered all that have plundered you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02437  017" id="37  017" >17</span>
 For I will bring about your healing, I will heal you of your grievous wound, says the Lord; for you are called Dispersed: she is your prey, for no one seeks after her.  <span class="verse" rel="v02437  018" id="37  018" >18</span>
 Thus said the Lord; Behold, I will turn the captivity of Jacob, and will have pity upon his prisoners; and the city shall be built upon her hill, and the people shall settle after their manner.  <span class="verse" rel="v02437  019" id="37  019" >19</span>
 And there shall go forth from them singers,   even   the sound of men making merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not at all be diminished.  <span class="verse" rel="v02437  020" id="37  020" >20</span>
 And their sons shall go in as before, and their testimonies shall be established before me, and I will visit them that afflict them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02437  021" id="37  021" >21</span>
 And their mighty ones shall be over them, and their prince shall proceed of themselves; and I will gather them, and they shall return to me: for who is this that has set his heart to return to me? says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02437  023" id="37  023" >23</span>
 For the wrathful anger of the lord has gone forth,   even   a whirlwind of anger has gone forth: it shall come upon the ungodly.  <span class="verse" rel="v02437  024" id="37  024" >24</span>

 Prepare yourself, O Sion; execute vengeance; look to your ways: return, O virgin of Israel, by the way by which you went, return mourning to your cities.  <span class="verse" rel="v02438  022" id="38  022" >22</span>

 Therefore I awake, and [*]saw; and my sleep was sweet to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02438  027" id="38  027" >27</span>

 In those days they shall certainly not say, The fathers ate a sour grape, and the children's teeth were set on edge.  <span class="verse" rel="v02438  030" id="38  030" >30</span>
 But every one shall die in his own sin; and the teeth of him that eats the sour grape shall be set on edge.  <span class="verse" rel="v02438  031" id="38  031" >31</span>

 not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took hold of their hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; for they abode not in my covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02438  033" id="38  033" >33</span>
 For this is my covenant which I will make with the house of Israel; after those days, says the Lord, I will surely put my laws into their mind, and write them on their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.  <span class="verse" rel="v02438  034" id="38  034" >34</span>
 And they shall not at all teach every one his   fellow   citizen, and every one his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them: for I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins I will remember no more.  <span class="verse" rel="v02438  035" id="38  035" >35</span>
 Thus says the Lord, who gives the sun for a light by day, the moon and the stars for a light by night, and   makes   a roaring in the sea, so that the waves thereof roar; the Lord Almighty is his name:  <span class="verse" rel="v02438  036" id="38  036" >36</span>

 Though the sky should be raised to a   greater   height, says the Lord, and though the ground of the earth should be sunk   lower   beneath, yet I will not cast off the family of Israel, says the Lord, for all that they have done.  <span class="verse" rel="v02438  038" id="38  038" >38</span>
 Behold, the days come, says the Lord, when the city shall be built to the Lord from the tower of Anameel to the gate of the corner.  <span class="verse" rel="v02438  039" id="38  039" >39</span>
 And the measurement of it shall proceed in front of them as far as the hills of Gareb, and it shall be compassed with a circular wall of choice stones.  <span class="verse" rel="v02438  040" id="38  040" >40</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="39  001">39  </span> The word that came from the Lord to Jeremias in the tenth year of king Sedekias, this is the eighteenth year of king Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  002" id="39  002" >2</span>
 And the host of the king of Babylon had made a rampart against Jerusalem: and Jeremias was kept in the court of the prison, which is in the king's house;  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  003" id="39  003" >3</span>
 in which king Sedekias   had   shut him up, saying, Therefore do you prophesy, saying, Thus says the Lord, Behold, I   will   give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  004" id="39  004" >4</span>
 and Sedekias shall by no means be delivered out of the hand of the Chaldeans, for he shall certainly be given up into the hands of the king of Babylon, and his mouth shall speak to his mouth, and his eyes shall look upon his eyes;  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  005" id="39  005" >5</span>
 and Sedekias shall go into Babylon, and dwell there?  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  006" id="39  006" >6</span>
 AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEREMIAS, SAYING,  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  007" id="39  007" >7</span>
 Behold, Anameel the son of Salom your father's brother is coming to you, saying, Buy you my field that is in Anathoth: for you   have   the right to take   it   as a purchase.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  008" id="39  008" >8</span>
 So Anameel the son of Salom my father's brother came to me into the court of the prison, and said, Buy you my field that is in the land of Benjamin, in Anathoth: for you   have   a right to buy it, and you are the elder. So I knew that it was the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  009" id="39  009" >9</span>
 And I bought the field of Anameel the son of my father's brother, and I weighed him seventeen shekels of silver.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  010" id="39  010" >10</span>
 And I wrote   it   in a book, and sealed   it  , and took the testimony of witnesses, and weighed the money in the balance.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  011" id="39  011" >11</span>
 And I took the book of the purchase that was sealed;  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  012" id="39  012" >12</span>
 and I gave it to Baruch son of Nerias, son of Maasaeas, in the sight of Anameel my father's brother's son, and in the sight of the men that stood by and wrote in the book of the purchase, and in the sight of the Jews that were in the court of the prison.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  013" id="39  013" >13</span>
 And I charged Baruch in their presence, saying, Thus says the Lord Almighty;  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  014" id="39  014" >14</span>
 Take this book of the purchase, and the book that has been read; and you shall put it into an earthen vessel, that it may remain many days.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  015" id="39  015" >15</span>
 For thus says the Lord; There shall yet be bought fields and houses and vineyards in this land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  016" id="39  016" >16</span>
 And I prayed to the Lord after I had given the book of the purchase to Baruch the son of Nerias, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  017" id="39  017" >17</span>
 O   ever   living Lord! you have made the heaven and the earth by your great power, and with your high and lofty arm: nothing can be hidden from you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  018" id="39  018" >18</span>
 Granting mercy to thousands, and recompensing the sins of the fathers into the bosoms of their children after them: the great, the strong God;  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  019" id="39  019" >19</span>
 the Lord of great counsel, and mighty in deeds, the great Almighty God, and Lord of great name: your eyes are upon the ways of the children of men, to give to every one according to his way:  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  020" id="39  020" >20</span>
 who have wrought signs and wonders in the land of Egypt even to this day, and in Israel, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and you did make for yourself a name, as at this day;  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  021" id="39  021" >21</span>
 and you did bring out your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, with a mighty hand, and with a high arm, and with great sights;  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  022" id="39  022" >22</span>
 and you gave them this land, which you did swear   to give   to their fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey;  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  023" id="39  023" >23</span>
 and they went in, and took it; but they listened not to your voice, and walked not in your ordinances; they did none of the things which you did command them, and they caused all these calamities to happen to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  024" id="39  024" >24</span>
 Behold, a multitude is come against the city to take it; and the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans that fight against it, by the power of the sword, and the famine: as you have spoken, so has it happened.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  025" id="39  025" >25</span>
 And you say to me, Buy you the field for money; and I wrote a book, and sealed   it  , and took the testimony of witnesses: and the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  026" id="39  026" >26</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  027" id="39  027" >27</span>
 I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: shall anything be hidden from me!  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  028" id="39  028" >28</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord God of Israel; This city shall certainly be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it:  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  029" id="39  029" >29</span>
 and the Chaldeans shall come to war against this city, and they shall burn this city with fire, and shall burn down the houses wherein they burnt incense on the roofs thereof to Baal, and poured drink-offerings to other gods, to provoke me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  030" id="39  030" >30</span>
 For the children of Israel and the children of Juda alone did evil in my sight from their youth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  031" id="39  031" >31</span>
 For this city was   obnoxious   to my anger and my wrath, from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from my presence,  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  032" id="39  032" >32</span>
 because of all the wickedness of the children of Israel and Juda, which they wrought to provoke me, they and their kings, and their princes, and their priests, and their prophets, the men of Juda, and the dwellers in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  033" id="39  033" >33</span>
 And they turned the back to me, and not the face: whereas I taught them early in the morning, but they listened no more to receive instructions.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  034" id="39  034" >34</span>
 And they set their pollutions in the house, on which my name was called, by their uncleannesses.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  035" id="39  035" >35</span>
 And they built to Baal the altars that are in the valley of the son of Ennom, to offer their sons and their daughters to king Moloch; which things I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Juda to sin.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  036" id="39  036" >36</span>
 And now thus has the Lord God of Israel said concerning this city, of which you say, it shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by famine, and banishment.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  037" id="39  037" >37</span>
 Behold, I   will   gather them out of every land, where I have scattered them in my anger, and my wrath, and great fury; and I will bring them back into this place, and will cause them to dwell safely:  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  038" id="39  038" >38</span>
 and they shall be to me a people, and I will be to them a god.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  039" id="39  039" >39</span>
 And I will give them another way, and another heart, to fear me continually, and   that   for good to them and their children after them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  040" id="39  040" >40</span>
 And I will make with them an everlasting covenant, which I will by no means turn away from them, and I will put my fear into their heart, that they may not depart from me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  041" id="39  041" >41</span>
 And I will visit   them   to do them good, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness, and with all my heart, and with all   my   soul.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  042" id="39  042" >42</span>
 For thus says the Lord; As I have brought upon this people all these great evils, so will I bring upon them all the good things which I pronounced upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  043" id="39  043" >43</span>
 And there shall yet be fields bought in the land, of which you say, it shall be destitute of man and beast; and they are delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" rel="v02439  044" id="39  044" >44</span>
 And they shall buy fields for money, and you shall write a book, and seal   it  , and shall take the testimony of witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Juda, and in the cities of the mountain, and in the cities of the plain, and in the cities of the south: for I will turn their captivity.

 And I will turn the captivity of Juda, and the captivity of Israel, and will build them, even as before.  <span class="verse" rel="v02440  008" id="40  008" >8</span>

 And it shall be for joy and praise, and for glory to all the people of the earth, who shall hear all the good that I will do: and they shall fear and be provoked for all the good things and for all the peace which I will bring upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02440  010" id="40  010" >10</span>

 and you shall not escape out of his hand, but shall certainly be taken, and shall be given into his hands; and your eyes shall see his eyes, and you shall enter into Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02441  004" id="41  004" >4</span>
 But hear the word of the Lord, O Sedekias king of Juda; Thus says the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v02441  005" id="41  005" >5</span>
 You shall die in peace: and as they wept for your fathers that reigned before you, they shall weep also for you,   saying  , Ah lord! and they shall lament for you down to the grave: for I have spoken the word, said the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02441  006" id="41  006" >6</span>
 And Jeremias spoke to king Sedekias all these words in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v02441  007" id="41  007" >7</span>
 And the host of the king of Babylon warred against Jerusalem, and against the cities of Juda, and against Lachis, and against Azeca: for these strong cities were left among the cities of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v02441  008" id="41  008" >8</span>
 The word that came from the Lord to Jeremias, after king Sedekias had concluded a covenant with the people, to proclaim a release;  <span class="verse" rel="v02441  009" id="41  009" >9</span>
 That every one should set at liberty his servant, and every one has handmaid, the Hebrew man and Hebrew woman, that no man of Juda should be a bondman.  <span class="verse" rel="v02441  010" id="41  010" >10</span>
 Then all the nobles, and all the people who had entered into the covenant,   engaging   to set free every one his man-servant, and every one his maid, turned,  <span class="verse" rel="v02441  011" id="41  011" >11</span>
 and gave them over to be menservants and maidservants.  <span class="verse" rel="v02441  012" id="41  012" >12</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02441  013" id="41  013" >13</span>
 Thus says the Lord; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day wherein I took them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02441  014" id="41  014" >14</span>
 When six years are accomplished, you shall set free your brother the Hebrew, who shall be sold to you: for he shall serve you six years, and   then   you shall let him go free: but they listened not to me, and inclined not their ear.  <span class="verse" rel="v02441  015" id="41  015" >15</span>
 And this day they turned to do that which was right in my sight, to proclaim every one the release of his neighbor; and they had concluded a covenant before me, in the house whereon my name is called.  <span class="verse" rel="v02441  016" id="41  016" >16</span>
 But you° turned and profaned my name, to bring back every one his servant, and every one his handmaid, whom you° had sent forth free   and   at their own disposal, to be to you menservants and maidservants.  <span class="verse" rel="v02441  017" id="41  017" >17</span>
 Therefore thus said the Lord; You° have not listened to me, to proclaim a release every one to his neighbor: behold, I proclaim a release to you, to the sword, and to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will give you up to dispersion   among   all the kingdoms of the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02441  018" id="41  018" >18</span>
 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, who have not kept my covenant, which they made before me, the calf which they prepared to sacrifice with it,  <span class="verse" rel="v02441  019" id="41  019" >19</span>
 the princes of Juda, and the men in power, and the priests, and the people;  <span class="verse" rel="v02441  020" id="41  020" >20</span>
 I will even give them to their enemies, and their carcases shall be food for the birds of the sky and for the wild beasts of the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02441  021" id="41  021" >21</span>
 And I will give Sedekias king of Judea, and their princes, into the hands of their enemies, and the host of the king of Babylon   shall come upon   them that run away from them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02441  022" id="41  022" >22</span>
 Behold, I   will   give command, says the Lord, and will bring them back to this land; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire, and the cities of Juda; and I will make them desolate without inhabitants.

<p><span class="chapter" id="42  001">42  </span> THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAS from the Lord in the days of Joakim, king of Juda, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02442  002" id="42  002" >2</span>
 Go to the house of the Archabin, and you shall bring them to the house of the Lord, into one of the courts, and give them wine to drink.  <span class="verse" rel="v02442  003" id="42  003" >3</span>
 So I brought forth Jechonias the son of Jeremin the son of Chabasin, and his brethren, and his sons, and all the family of the Archabin;  <span class="verse" rel="v02442  004" id="42  004" >4</span>
 and I brought them into the house of the Lord, into the chamber of the sons of Joanan, the son of Ananias, the son of Godolias, a man of God, who dwells near the house of the princes that are over the house of Maasaeas the son of Selom, who kept the court.  <span class="verse" rel="v02442  005" id="42  005" >5</span>
 And I set before them a jar of wine, and cups, and I said, Drink you° wine.  <span class="verse" rel="v02442  006" id="42  006" >6</span>
 But they said, We will on no account drink wine, for our father Jonadab the son of Rechab commanded us, saying, You° shall on no account drink wine,   neither   you°, nor your sons for ever:  <span class="verse" rel="v02442  007" id="42  007" >7</span>
 nor shall you° at all build houses, nor sow any seed, nor shall you° have a vineyard: for you° shall dwell in tents all your days; that you° may live many days upon the land, in which you° sojourn.  <span class="verse" rel="v02442  008" id="42  008" >8</span>
 And we listened to the voice of Jonadab our father, so as to drink no wine all our days, we, and our wives, and our sons, and our daughters;  <span class="verse" rel="v02442  009" id="42  009" >9</span>
 and so as to build no houses to dwell in: and we have had no vineyard, nor field, nor seed:  <span class="verse" rel="v02442  010" id="42  010" >10</span>
 but we have lived in tents, and have listened, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.  <span class="verse" rel="v02442  011" id="42  011" >11</span>
 And it came to pass, when Nabuchodonosor came up against the land, that we said we would come in; and we entered into Jerusalem, for fear of the host of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the host of the Assyrians: and we lived there.  <span class="verse" rel="v02442  012" id="42  012" >12</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02442  013" id="42  013" >13</span>
 Thus says the Lord, Go, and say to the men of Juda, and to them that dwell in Jerusalem, Will you° not receive correction to listen to my words?  <span class="verse" rel="v02442  014" id="42  014" >14</span>
 The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the word which he commanded his children, that they should drink no wine; and they have not drunk   it  : but I spoke to you early, and you° listened not.  <span class="verse" rel="v02442  015" id="42  015" >15</span>
 And I sent to you my servants the prophets, saying, Turn you° every one from his evil way, and amend your practices, and go not after other gods to serve them, and you° shall dwell upon the land which I gave to you and to your fathers: but you° inclined not your ears, and listened not.  <span class="verse" rel="v02442  016" id="42  016" >16</span>
 But the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the command of their father; but this people has not listened to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02442  017" id="42  017" >17</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord; Behold, I   will   bring upon Juda and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evils which I pronounced against them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02442  018" id="42  018" >18</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord; Since the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have listened to the command of their father, to do as their father commanded them:  <span class="verse" rel="v02442  019" id="42  019" >19</span>
 there shall never be lacking a man of the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab to stand before my face while the earth remains.

<p><span class="chapter" id="43  001">43  </span> IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF JOAKIM son of Josias king of Juda, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  002" id="43  002" >2</span>
 Take you a roll of a book, and write upon it all the words which I spoke to you against Jerusalem, and against Juda, and against all the nations, from the day when I spoke to you, from the days of Josias king of Juda, even to this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  003" id="43  003" >3</span>
 Perhaps the house of Juda will hear all the evils which I purpose to do to them; that they may turn from their evil way; and   so   I will be merciful to their iniquities and their sins.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  004" id="43  004" >4</span>
 So Jeremias called Baruch the son of Nerias: and he wrote from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the Lord, which he had spoken to him, on a roll of a book.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  005" id="43  005" >5</span>
 And Jeremias commanded Baruch, saying, I am in prison; I can’t enter into the house of the Lord:  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  006" id="43  006" >6</span>
 so you shall read in this roll in the ears of the people in the house of the Lord, on the fast day; and in the ears of all Juda that come out of their cities, you shall read to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  007" id="43  007" >7</span>
 Peradventure their supplication will come before the Lord, and they will turn from their evil way: for great is the wrath and the anger of the Lord, which he has pronounced against this people.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  008" id="43  008" >8</span>
 And Baruch did according to all that Jeremias commanded him—reading in the book the words of the Lord in the Lord's house.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  009" id="43  009" >9</span>
 And it came to pass in the eighth year of king Joakim, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem, and the house of Juda, proclaimed a fast before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  010" id="43  010" >10</span>
 And Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremias in the house of the Lord, in the house of Gamarias son of Saphan the scribe, in the upper court, in the entrance of the new gate of the house of the Lord, and in the ears of all the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  011" id="43  011" >11</span>
 And Michaeas the son of Gamarias the son of Saphan heard all the words of the Lord, out of the book.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  012" id="43  012" >12</span>
 And he went down to the king's house, into the house of the scribe: and, behold, there were sitting there all the princes, Elisama the scribe, and Dalaeas the son of Selemias, and Jonathan the son of Acchobor, and Gamarias the son of Saphan, and Sedekias the son of Ananias, and all the princes.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  013" id="43  013" >13</span>
 And Michaeas reported to them all the words which he had heard Baruch reading in the ears of the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  014" id="43  014" >14</span>
 And all the princes sent to Baruch son of Nerias Judin the son of Nathanias, the son of Selemias, the son of Chusi, saying, Take in your hand the roll in which you read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch took the roll, and went down to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  015" id="43  015" >15</span>
 And they said to him, Read   it   again in our ears. And Baruch read   it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  016" id="43  016" >16</span>
 And it came to pass, when they   had   heard all the words,   that   they took counsel each with his neighbor, and said, Let us by all means tell the king all these words.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  017" id="43  017" >17</span>
 And they asked Baruch, saying, Where did you write all these words?  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  018" id="43  018" >18</span>
 And Baruch said, Jeremias told me from his   own   mouth all these words, and I wrote them in a book.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  019" id="43  019" >19</span>
 And they said to Baruch, Go, and hide, you and Jeremias; let no man know where you°   are  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  020" id="43  020" >20</span>
 And they went in to the king into the court, and gave the roll   to one   to keep in the house of Elisama; and they told the king all these words.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  021" id="43  021" >21</span>
 And the king sent Judin to fetch the roll: and he took it out of the house of Elisama: and Judin read in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes who stood round the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  022" id="43  022" >22</span>
 Now the king was sitting in the winter house: and   there was   a fire on the hearth before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  023" id="43  023" >23</span>
 And it came to pass when Judin had read three or four leaves, he cut them off with a penknife, and cast   them   into the fire that was on the hearth, until the whole roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  024" id="43  024" >24</span>
 And the king and his servants that heard all these words sought not   the Lord  , and tore not their garments.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  025" id="43  025" >25</span>
 But Elnathan and Godolias suggested to the king that he should burn the roll.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  026" id="43  026" >26</span>
 And the king commanded Jeremeel the king's son, and Saraeas the son of Esriel, to take Baruch and Jeremias: but they were hidden.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  027" id="43  027" >27</span>
 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, after the king had burnt the roll,   even   all the words which Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremias, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  028" id="43  028" >28</span>
 Again take you another roll, and write all the words that were on the roll, which king Joakim has burnt.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  029" id="43  029" >29</span>
 And you shall say, Thus says the Lord; You have burnt this roll, saying, Why have you written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come in, and destroy this land, and man and cattle shall fail from off it?  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  030" id="43  030" >30</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Joakim king of Juda; He shall not have   a man   to sit on the throne of David: and his carcass shall be cast forth in the heat by day, and in the frost by night.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  031" id="43  031" >31</span>
 And I will visit him, and his family, and his servants: and I will bring upon him, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the land of Juda, all the evils which I spoke of to them; and they listened not.  <span class="verse" rel="v02443  032" id="43  032" >32</span>
 And Baruch took another roll, and wrote upon it from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the book which Joakim had burnt: and there were yet more words added to it like the former.  
<!-- 44   032 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="44  001">44  </span> And Sedekias the son of Josias reigned instead of Joakim, whom Nabuchodonosor appointed to reign over Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  002" id="44  002" >2</span>
 And he and his servants and the people of the land listened not to the words of the Lord, which he spoke by Jeremias.  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  003" id="44  003" >3</span>
 And king Sedekias sent Joachal son of Selemias and Sophonias the priest son of Maasaeas to Jeremias, saying, Pray now for us to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  004" id="44  004" >4</span>
 Now Jeremias came and went through the midst of the city: for they   had   not put him into the house of the prison.  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  005" id="44  005" >5</span>
 And the host of Pharao was come forth out of Egypt; and the Chaldeans heard the report of them, and they went up from Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  006" id="44  006" >6</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  007" id="44  007" >7</span>
 Thus said the Lord; Thus shall you say to the king of Juda who sent to you, to seek me; Behold, the army of Pharao which is come forth to help you: they shall return to the land of Egypt:  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  008" id="44  008" >8</span>
 and the Chaldeans themselves shall turn again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  009" id="44  009" >9</span>
 For thus says the Lord; Suppose not in your hearts, saying, The Chaldeans will certainly depart from us: for they shall not depart.  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  010" id="44  010" >10</span>
 And though you° should strike the whole host of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there should be left a few wounded   men  , these should rise up each in his place, and burn this city with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  011" id="44  011" >11</span>
 And it came to pass, when the host of the Chaldeans had gone up from Jerusalem for fear of the host of Pharao,  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  012" id="44  012" >12</span>
 that Jeremias went forth from Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to buy thence   a property   in the midst of the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  013" id="44  013" >13</span>
 And he was in the gate of Benjamin, and   there was   there a man with whom he lodged, Saruia the son of Selemias, the son of Ananias; and he caught Jeremias, saying, You are fleeing to the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  014" id="44  014" >14</span>
 And he said,   It is   false; I do not flee to the Chaldeans. But he listened not to him; and Saruia caught Jeremias, and brought him to the princes.  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  015" id="44  015" >15</span>
 And the princes were very angry with Jeremias, and struck him, and sent him into the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made this a prison.  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  016" id="44  016" >16</span>
 So Jeremias came into the dungeon, and into the cells, and he remained there many days.  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  017" id="44  017" >17</span>
 Then Sedekias sent, and called him; and the king asked him secretly, saying, Is there a word from the Lord? and he said, There is: you shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  018" id="44  018" >18</span>
 And Jeremias said to the king, Wherein have I wronged you, or your servants, or this people, that you put me in prison?  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  019" id="44  019" >19</span>
 And where are your prophets who prophesied to you saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against this land?  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  020" id="44  020" >20</span>
 Now therefore, my lord the king, let my supplication come before your face: and why do you send me back to the house of Jonathan the scribe? and let me not on any account die there.  <span class="verse" rel="v02444  021" id="44  021" >21</span>
 Then the king commanded, and they cast him into the prison, and gave him a loaf a day out of the place where they bake, until the bread failed out of the city. So Jeremias continued in the court of the prison.  
<!-- 45   021 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="45  001">45  </span> And Saphanias the son of Nathan, and Godolias the son of Paschor, and Joachal the son of Semelias, heard the words which Jeremias spoke to the people, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  002" id="45  002" >2</span>
 Thus says the Lord; He that remains in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine: but he that goes out to the Chaldeans shall live; and his soul shall be given him for a found treasure, and he shall live.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  003" id="45  003" >3</span>
 For thus says the Lord; This city shall certainly be delivered into the hands of the host of the king of Babylon, and they shall take it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  004" id="45  004" >4</span>
 And they said to the king, Let that man, we pray you, be slain, for he weakens the hands of the fighting men that are left in the city, and the hands of all the people, speaking to them according to these words: for this man does not prophesy peace to this people, but evil.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  005" id="45  005" >5</span>
 Then the king said, Behold, he is in your hands. For the king could not resist them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  006" id="45  006" >6</span>
 And they cast him into the dungeon of Melchias the king's son, which was in the court of the prison; and they let him down into the pit: and there was no water in the pit, but mire: and he was in the mire.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  007" id="45  007" >7</span>
 And Abdemelech the Ethiopian heard, (now he was in the king's household,) that they   had   put Jeremias into the dungeon; and the king was in the gate of Benjamin:  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  008" id="45  008" >8</span>
 and he went forth to him, and spoke to the king and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  009" id="45  009" >9</span>
 You have done evil in what you have done to kill this man with hunger: for there is no more bread in the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  010" id="45  010" >10</span>
 And the king commanded Abdemelech, saying, Take with you hence thirty men, and bring him up out of the dungeon, that he die not.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  011" id="45  011" >11</span>
 So Abdemelech took the men and went into the underground   part of the   king's house, and took thence old rags and old ropes, and threw them to Jeremias into the dungeon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  012" id="45  012" >12</span>
 And he said, Put these under the ropes. And Jeremias did so.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  013" id="45  013" >13</span>
 And they drew him with the ropes, and lifted him out of the dungeon: and Jeremias remained in the court of the prison.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  014" id="45  014" >14</span>
 Then the king sent, and called him to himself into the house of Aselisel, which was in the house of the Lord: and the king said to him, I will ask you a question, and I pray you hide nothing from me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  015" id="45  015" >15</span>
 And Jeremias said to the king, If I tell you, will you not certainly put me to death? and if I give you counsel, you will not at all listen to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  016" id="45  016" >16</span>
 And the king swore to him, saying,   As   the Lord lives who gave us this soul, I will not kill you, neither will I give you into the hands of these men.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  017" id="45  017" >17</span>
 And Jeremias said to him, Thus says the Lord; If you will indeed go forth to the captains of the king of Babylon, your soul shall live, and this city shall certainly not be burnt with fire; and you shall live, and your house.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  018" id="45  018" >18</span>
 But if you will not go forth this city shall be delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall by no means escape.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  019" id="45  019" >19</span>
 And the king said to Jeremias, I consider the Jews that have gone over to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hands, and they mock me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  020" id="45  020" >20</span>
 And Jeremias said, They shall in no wise deliver you up. Hear the word of the Lord which I speak to you; and it shall be better for you, and your soul shall live.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  021" id="45  021" >21</span>
 But if you will not go forth, this is the word which the Lord has shown me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  022" id="45  022" >22</span>
 And, behold, all the women that are left in the house of the king of Juda were brought forth to the princes of the king of Babylon; and they said, The men who were at peace with you have deceived you, and will prevail against you; and they shall cause your foot to slide and fail, they have turned back from you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  023" id="45  023" >23</span>
 And they shall bring forth your wives and your children to the Chaldeans: and you shall by no means escape, for you shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon, and this city shall be burnt.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  024" id="45  024" >24</span>
 Then the king said to him, Let no man know   any   of these words, and certainly you shall not die.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  025" id="45  025" >25</span>
 And if the princes shall hear that I have spoken to you, and they come to you, and say to you, Tell us, what said the king to you? hide   it   not from us, and we will in no wise kill you, and what said the king to you?  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  026" id="45  026" >26</span>
 Then you shall say to them, I brought my supplication before the presence of the king, that he would not send me back into the house of Jonathan, that I should die there.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  027" id="45  027" >27</span>
 And all the princes came to Jeremias, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words, which the king had commanded him. And they were silent, because the word of the Lord was not heard.  <span class="verse" rel="v02445  028" id="45  028" >28</span>
 And Jeremias remained in the court of the prison, until the time when Jerusalem was taken.

<p><span class="chapter" id="46  001">46  </span> And it came to pass in the ninth month of Sedekias king of Juda,   that   Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02446  002" id="46  002" >2</span>
 And in the eleventh year of Sedekiass, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the city was broken   up  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02446  003" id="46  003" >3</span>
 And all the leaders of the king of Babylon went in, and sat in the middle gate, Marganasar, and Samagoth, and Nabusachar, and Nabusaris, Nagargas, Naserrabamath, and the rest of the leaders of the king of Babylon,  <span class="verse" rel="v02446  014" id="46  014" >14</span>
 and they sent, and took Jeremias out of the court of the prison, and gave him   in charge   to Godolias the son of Achicam, the son of Saphan: and they brought him out, and he sat in the midst of the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v02446  015" id="46  015" >15</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias in the court of the prison, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02446  016" id="46  016" >16</span>
 Go and say to Abdemelech the Ethiopian, Thus said the Lord God of Israel; Behold, I   will   bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good.  <span class="verse" rel="v02446  017" id="46  017" >17</span>
 But I will save you in that day, and I will by no means deliver you into the hands of the men before whom you are afraid.  <span class="verse" rel="v02446  018" id="46  018" >18</span>
 For I will surely save you, and you shall by no means fall by the sword; and you shall find your life, because you did trust in me, says the Lord.

<p><span class="chapter" id="47  001">47  </span> The word that came from the Lord to Jeremias, after that Nabuzardan the captain of the guard had let him go out of Rama, when he had taken him in manacles in the midst of the captivity of Juda,   even   those who were carried to Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02447  002" id="47  002" >2</span>
 And the chief captain of the guard took him, and said to him, The Lord your God has pronounced all these evils upon this place:  <span class="verse" rel="v02447  003" id="47  003" >3</span>
 and the Lord has done it; because you° sinned against him, and listened not to his voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v02447  004" id="47  004" >4</span>
 Behold, I have loosed you from the manacles that were upon your hands. If it seem good to you to go with me to Babylon, then will I set my eyes upon you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02447  005" id="47  005" >5</span>
 But if not, depart; return to Godolias the son of Achicam, the son of Saphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed governor in the land of Juda, and dwell with him in the midst of the people in the land of Juda: to whatever places it seems good in your eyes to go, do you even go. And the captain of the guard made him presents, and let him go.  <span class="verse" rel="v02447  006" id="47  006" >6</span>
 And he came to Godolias to Massepha, and lived in the midst of his people that was left in the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02447  007" id="47  007" >7</span>
 And all the leaders of the host that was in the country, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Godolias   governor   in the land, and they committed to him the men and their wives, whom   Nabuchodonosor had   not removed to Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02447  008" id="47  008" >8</span>
 And there came to Godolias to Massepha Ismael the son of Nathanias, and Joanan son of Caree, and Saraeas the son of Thanaemeth, and the sons of Jophe the Netophathite, and Ezonias son of the Mochathite, they and their men.  <span class="verse" rel="v02447  009" id="47  009" >9</span>
 And Godolias swore to them and to their men, saying, Be not afraid before the children of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be better for you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02447  010" id="47  010" >10</span>
 And, behold, I dwell in your presence at Massepha, to stand before the Chaldeans who shall come against you: and do you° gather grapes, and fruits, and oil, and put   them   into your vessels, and dwell in the cities which you° have obtained possession of.  <span class="verse" rel="v02447  011" id="47  011" >11</span>
 And all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and those   that were   in Idumea, and those   that were   in all   the rest of   the country, heard that the king of Babylon   had   granted a remnant to Juda, and that he had appointed over them Godolias the son of Achicam.  <span class="verse" rel="v02447  012" id="47  012" >12</span>
 And they came to Godolias into the land of Juda, to Massepha, and gathered grapes, and very much summer fruit, and oil.  <span class="verse" rel="v02447  013" id="47  013" >13</span>
 And Joanan the son of Caree, and all the leaders of the host, who were in the fields, came to Godolias to Massepha,  <span class="verse" rel="v02447  014" id="47  014" >14</span>
 and said to him, Do you indeed know that king Beleissa son of Ammon has sent Ismael to you to kill you? But Godolias believed them not.  <span class="verse" rel="v02447  015" id="47  015" >15</span>
 And Joanan said to Godolias secretly in Massepha, I will go now and strike Ismael, and let no man know   it  ; lest he kill you, and all the Jews that are gathered to you be dispersed, and the remnant of Juda perish.  <span class="verse" rel="v02447  016" id="47  016" >16</span>
 But Godolias said to Joanan, Do not the thing, for you speak lies concerning Ismael.  
<!-- 48   016 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="48  001">48  </span> Now it came to pass in the seventh month that Ismael the son of Nathanias the son of Eleasa of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, to Godolias to Massepha: and they ate bread there together.  <span class="verse" rel="v02448  002" id="48  002" >2</span>
 And Ismael rose up, and the ten men that were with him, and struck Godolias, whom the king of Babylon had appointed   governor   over the land,  <span class="verse" rel="v02448  003" id="48  003" >3</span>
 and all the Jews that were with him in Massepha, and all the Chaldeans that were found there.  <span class="verse" rel="v02448  004" id="48  004" >4</span>
 And it came to pass on the second day after he had struck Godolias, and no man knew   of it  ,  <span class="verse" rel="v02448  005" id="48  005" >5</span>
 that there came men from Sychem, and from Salem, and from Samaria,   even   eighty men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes tore, and beating their breasts, and   they had   manna and frankincense in their hands, to bring   them   into the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02448  006" id="48  006" >6</span>
 And Ismael went out to meet them;   and   they went on and wept: and he said to them, Come in to Godolias.  <span class="verse" rel="v02448  007" id="48  007" >7</span>
 And it came to pass, when they had entered into the midst of the city,   that   he killed them   and cast them   into a pit.  <span class="verse" rel="v02448  008" id="48  008" >8</span>
 But ten men were found there, and they said to Ismael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, wheat and barley, honey and oil. So he passed by, and killed them not in the midst of their brethren.  <span class="verse" rel="v02448  009" id="48  009" >9</span>
 Now the pit into which Ismael cast all whom he struck, is the great pit, which king Asa had made for fear of Baasa king of Israel:   even   this Ismael filled with slain men.  <span class="verse" rel="v02448  010" id="48  010" >10</span>
 And Ismael brought back all the people that were left in Massepha, and the king's daughter, whom the captain of the guard had committed in charge to Godolias the son of Achicam: and he went away beyond the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02448  011" id="48  011" >11</span>
 And Joanan the son of Caree, and all the leaders of the host that were with him, heard of all the evil deeds which Ismael had done.  <span class="verse" rel="v02448  012" id="48  012" >12</span>
 And they brought all their army, and went to fight against him, and found him near much water in Gabaon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02448  013" id="48  013" >13</span>
 And it came to pass, when all the people that was with Ismael saw Joanan, and the leaders of the host that was with him,  <span class="verse" rel="v02448  014" id="48  014" >14</span>
 that they returned to Joanan.  <span class="verse" rel="v02448  015" id="48  015" >15</span>
 But Ismael escaped with eight men and went to the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02448  016" id="48  016" >16</span>
 And Joanan, and all the leaders of the host that were with him, took all the remnant of the people, whom he   had   brought back from Ismael, mighty men in war, and the women, and the other   property  , and the eunuchs, whom they   had   brought back from Gabaon:  <span class="verse" rel="v02448  017" id="48  017" >17</span>
 and they departed, and lived in Gaberoch-amaa, that is by Bethleem, to go into Egypt, for fear of the Chaldeans:  <span class="verse" rel="v02448  018" id="48  018" >18</span>
 for they were afraid of them, because Ismael had struck Godolias, whom the king of Babylon made   governor   in the land.  
<!-- 49   018 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="49  001">49  </span> Then came all the leaders of the host, and Joanan, and Azarias the son of Maasaeas, and all the people great and small,  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  002" id="49  002" >2</span>
 to Jeremias the prophet, and said to him, Let now our supplication come before your face, and pray you to the Lord your God for this remnant; for we are left few out of many, as your eyes see.  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  003" id="49  003" >3</span>
 And let the Lord your God declare to us the way wherein we should walk, and the thing which we should do.  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  004" id="49  004" >4</span>
 And Jeremias said to them, I have heard   you  ; behold, I will pray for you to the Lord our God, according to your words; and it shall come to pass,   that   whatever word the Lord God shall answer, I will declare   it   to you; I will not hide anything from you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  005" id="49  005" >5</span>
 And they said to Jeremias, Let the Lord be between us for a just and faithful witness, if we do not according to every word which the Lord shall send to us.  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  006" id="49  006" >6</span>
 And whether   it be   good, or whether   it be   evil, we will listen to the voice of the Lord our God, to whom we send you; that it may be well with us, because we shall listen to the voice of the Lord our God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  007" id="49  007" >7</span>
 And it came to pass after ten days,   that   the word of the Lord came to Jeremias.  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  008" id="49  008" >8</span>
 And he called Joanan, and the leaders of the host, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  009" id="49  009" >9</span>
 and he said to them, Thus says the Lord;  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  010" id="49  010" >10</span>
 If you° will indeed dwell in this land, I will build you, and will not pull   you   down, but will plant you, and in no wise pluck you up: for I have ceased from the calamities which I brought upon you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  011" id="49  011" >11</span>
 Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you° are afraid; be not afraid of him, says the Lord: for I am with you, to deliver you, and save you out of their hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  012" id="49  012" >12</span>
 And I will grant you mercy, and pity you, and will restore you to your land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  013" id="49  013" >13</span>
 But if you° say, We will not dwell in this land, that we may not listen to the voice of the Lord;  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  014" id="49  014" >14</span>
 for we will go into the land of Egypt, and we shall see no war, and shall not hear the sound of a trumpet, and we shall not hunger for bread; and there we will dwell:  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  015" id="49  015" >15</span>
 then hear the word of the Lord; thus says the Lord;  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  016" id="49  016" >16</span>
 If you° set your face toward Egypt, and go in there to dwell; then it shall be,   that   the sword which you° fear shall find you in the land of Egypt, and the famine to which you° have regard, shall overtake you,   coming   after you in Egypt; and there you° shall die.  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  017" id="49  017" >17</span>
 And all the men, and all the strangers who have set their face toward the land of Egypt to dwell there, shall be consumed by the sword, and by the famine: and there shall not one of them escape from the evils which I bring upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  018" id="49  018" >18</span>
 For thus says the Lord; As my wrath has dropped upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath drop upon you, when you° have entered into Egypt: and you° shall be a desolation, and under the power of others, and a curse and a reproach: and you° shall no more see this place.  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  019" id="49  019" >19</span>
    These are the words   which the Lord has spoken concerning you the remnant of Juda; Enter you° not into Egypt: and now know you° for a certainty,  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  020" id="49  020" >20</span>
 that you° have wrought wickedness in your hearts, when you° sent me, saying, Pray you for us to the Lord; and according to all that the Lord shall speak to you we will do.  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  021" id="49  021" >21</span>
 And you° have not listened to the voice of the Lord, with which he sent me to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02449  022" id="49  022" >22</span>
 Now therefore you° shall perish by sword and by famine, in the place which you° desire to go into to dwell there.

<p><span class="chapter" id="50  001">50  </span> And it came to pass, when Jeremias ceased speaking to the people all the words of the Lord,   for   which the Lord had sent him to them,   even   all these words,  <span class="verse" rel="v02450  002" id="50  002" >2</span>
 that Azarias son of Maasaeas spoke, and Joanan, the son of Caree, and all the men who had spoken to Jeremias, saying,   It is   false: the Lord has not sent you to us, saying, Enter not into Egypt to dwell there:  <span class="verse" rel="v02450  003" id="50  003" >3</span>
 but Baruch the son of Nerias sets you against us, that you may deliver us into the hands of the Chaldeans, to kill us, and that we should be carried away captives to Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02450  004" id="50  004" >4</span>
 So Joanan, and all the leaders of the host, and all the people, refused to listen to the voice of the Lord, to dwell in the land of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v02450  005" id="50  005" >5</span>
 And Joanan, and all the leaders of the host, took all the remnant of Juda, who had returned to dwell in the land;  <span class="verse" rel="v02450  006" id="50  006" >6</span>
 the mighty men, and the women, and the children that were left, and the daughters of the king, and the souls which Nabuzardan had left with Godolias the son of Achicam and Jeremias the prophet, and Baruch the son of Nerias.  <span class="verse" rel="v02450  007" id="50  007" >7</span>
 And they came into Egypt: for they listened not to the voice of the Lord: and they entered into Taphnas.  <span class="verse" rel="v02450  008" id="50  008" >8</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias in Taphnas, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02450  009" id="50  009" >9</span>
 Take you great stones, and hide them in the entrance, at the gate of the house of Pharao in Taphnas, in the sight of the men of Juda:  <span class="verse" rel="v02450  010" id="50  010" >10</span>
 and you shall say, Thus has the Lord said; Behold, I   will   send, and will bring Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and he shall place his throne upon these stones which you have hidden, and he shall lift up weapons against them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02450  011" id="50  011" >11</span>
 And he shall enter in, and strike the land of Egypt,   delivering   some for death to death; and some for captivity to captivity; and some for the sword to the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v02450  012" id="50  012" >12</span>
 And he shall kindle a fire in the houses of their gods, and shall burn them, and shall carry them away captives: and shall search the land of Egypt, as a shepherd searches his garment; and he shall go forth in peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v02450  013" id="50  013" >13</span>

 Thus has the Lord God of Israel said; You° have seen all the evils which I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon the cities of Juda; and, behold, they are desolate without inhabitants,  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  003" id="51  003" >3</span>
 because of their wickedness, which they have wrought to provoke me,   by   going to burn incense to other gods, whom you° knew not.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  004" id="51  004" >4</span>
 yet I sent to you my servants the prophets early in the morning, and I sent, saying, Do not you° this abominable thing which I hate.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  005" id="51  005" >5</span>
 But they listened not to me, and inclined not their ear to turn from their wickedness, so as not to burn incense to strange gods.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  006" id="51  006" >6</span>
 So my anger and my wrath dropped   upon them  , and was kindled in the gates of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they became a desolation and a waste, as at this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  007" id="51  007" >7</span>

 by provoking me with the works of your hands, to burn incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, into which you° entered to dwell there, that you° might be cut off, and that you° might become a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  009" id="51  009" >9</span>
 Have you° forgotten the sins of your fathers, and the sins of the kings of Juda, and the sins of your princes, and the sins of your wives, which they wrought in the land of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem?  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  010" id="51  010" >10</span>
 And have not ceased even to this day, and they have not kept to my ordinances, which I set before their fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  011" id="51  011" >11</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord; Behold I do set my face against   you    <span class="verse" rel="v02451  012" id="51  012" >12</span>
 to destroy all the remnant that are in Egypt; and they shall fall by the sword, and by famine, and shall be consumed small and great: and they shall be for reproach, and for destruction, and for a curse.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  013" id="51  013" >13</span>
 And I will visit them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have visited Jerusalem, with sword and with famine:  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  014" id="51  014" >14</span>
 and there shall not one be preserved of the remnant of Juda that sojourn in the land of Egypt, to return to the land of Juda, to which they hope in their hearts to return: they shall not return, but only they that escape.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  015" id="51  015" >15</span>
 Then all the men that knew that their wives burned incense, and all the women, a great multitude, and all the people that lived in the land of Egypt, in Pathura, answered Jeremias, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  016" id="51  016" >16</span>
    As for   the word which you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not listen to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  017" id="51  017" >17</span>
 For we will surely perform every word that shall proceed out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour drink-offerings to her, as we and our fathers have done, and our kings and princes, in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem: and   so   we were filled with bread, and were well, and saw no evils.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  018" id="51  018" >18</span>
 But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, we have all been brought low, and have been consumed by sword and by famine.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  019" id="51  019" >19</span>
 And whereas we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured drink-offerings to her, did we make cakes to her, and pour drink-offerings to her, without our husbands?  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  020" id="51  020" >20</span>
 Then Jeremias answered all the people, the mighty men, and the women, and all the people that returned him   these   words for answer, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  021" id="51  021" >21</span>
 Did not the Lord remember the incense which you° burned in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you°, and your fathers, and your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land? and came it not into his heart?  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  022" id="51  022" >22</span>
 And the Lord could no longer bear   you  , because of the wickedness of your doings, and because of your abominations which you° wrought; and so your land became a desolation and a waste, and a curse, as at this day;  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  023" id="51  023" >23</span>
 because of your burning incense, and   because   of the things wherein you° sinned against the Lord: and you° have not listened to the voice of the Lord, and have not walked in his ordinances, and in his law, and in his testimonies; and so these evils have come upon you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  024" id="51  024" >24</span>
 And Jeremias said to the people, and to the women, Hear you° the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  025" id="51  025" >25</span>
 Thus has the Lord God of Israel said; You° women have spoken with your mouth, and you° fulfilled   it   with your hands, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour drink-offerings to her: full well did you° keep to your vows, and you° have indeed performed   them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  026" id="51  026" >26</span>
 Therefore hear you° the word of the Lord, all Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, says the Lord, my name shall no longer be in the mouth of every Jew to say, The Lord lives, in all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  027" id="51  027" >27</span>
 For I have watched over them, to hurt them, and not to do them good: and all the Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt shall perish by sword and by famine, until they are utterly consumed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  028" id="51  028" >28</span>
 And they that escape the sword shall return to the land of Juda few in number, and the remnant of Juda, who have continued in the land   of   Egypt to dwell there, shall know whose word shall stand.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  029" id="51  029" >29</span>
 And this   shall be   a sign to you, that I will visit you for evil.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  030" id="51  030" >30</span>
 Thus said the Lord; Behold, I   will   give Uaphres king of Egypt into the hands of his enemy, and into the hands of one that seeks his life; as I gave Sedekias king of Juda into the hands of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, his enemy, and who sought his life.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  031" id="51  031" >31</span>
 THE WORD WHICH JEREMIAS THE PROPHET spoke to Baruch son of Nerias, when he wrote these words in the book from the mouth of Jeremias, in the fourth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  032" id="51  032" >32</span>
 Thus has the Lord said to you, O Baruch.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  033" id="51  033" >33</span>
 Whereas you have said, Alas! alas! for the Lord has laid a grievous trouble upon me; I lay down in groaning, I found no rest;  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  034" id="51  034" >34</span>
 say you to him, Thus says the Lord; Behold, I pull down those whom I have built up, and I pluck up those whom I have planted.  <span class="verse" rel="v02451  035" id="51  035" >35</span>
 And will you seek great things for yourself? seek   them   not: for, behold, I bring evil upon all flesh, says the Lord: but I will give   to you   your life for a spoil in every place whither you shall go.

<p><span class="chapter" id="52  001">52  </span> It was the twenty-first year of Sedekias, when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Amitaal, the daughter of Jeremias, of Lobena.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  004" id="52  004" >4</span>
 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the ninth month, on the tenth day of the month,   that   Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and they made a rampart round it, and built a wall round about it with large stones.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  005" id="52  005" >5</span>
 So the city was besieged, until the eleventh year of king Sedekias,  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  006" id="52  006" >6</span>
 on the ninth day of the month, and   then   the famine was severe in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  007" id="52  007" >7</span>
 And the city was broken up, and all the men of war went out by night by the way of the gate, between the wall and the outworks, which were by the king's garden; and the Chaldeans were by the city round about; and they went by the way   leading   to the wilderness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  008" id="52  008" >8</span>
 But the host of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the   country   beyond Jericho; and all his servants were dispersed from   about   him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  009" id="52  009" >9</span>
 And they took the king, and brought him to the king of Babylon to Deblatha, and he judged him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  010" id="52  010" >10</span>
 And the king of Babylon killed the sons of Sedekias before his eyes; and he killed all the princes of Juda in Deblatha.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  011" id="52  011" >11</span>
 And he put out the eyes of Sedekias, and bound him in fetters; and the king of Babylon brought him to Babylon, and put him into the grinding-house, until the day when he died.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  012" id="52  012" >12</span>
 And in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nabuzardan the captain of the guard, who waited on the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem;  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  013" id="52  013" >13</span>
 and he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king's house; and all the houses of the city, and every great house he burnt with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  014" id="52  014" >14</span>
 And the host of the Chaldeans that was with the captain of the guard pulled down all the wall of Jerusalem round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  016" id="52  016" >16</span>
 But the captain of the guard left the remnant of the people to be vinedressers and husbandmen.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  017" id="52  017" >17</span>
 And the Chaldeans broke in pieces the brazen pillars that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the Lord, and they took the brass thereof, and carried it away to Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  018" id="52  018" >18</span>
 Also the rim, and the bowls, and the flesh hooks, and all the brazen vessels, wherewith they ministered;  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  019" id="52  019" >19</span>
 and the basins, and the snuffers, and the oil-funnels, and the candlesticks, and the censers, and the cups, the golden, of gold, and the silver, of silver, the captain of the guard took away.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  020" id="52  020" >20</span>
 And the two pillars, and the one sea, and the twelve brazen oxen under the sea, which   things   king Solomon made for the house of the Lord; the brass of which   articles   was without weight.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  021" id="52  021" >21</span>
 And as for the pillars, the height of one pillar was thirty-five cubits; and a line of twelve cubits compassed it round; and the thickness of it   all   round was four fingers.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  022" id="52  022" >22</span>
 And   there was   a brazen chapiter upon them, and the length was five cubits,   even   the height of one chapiter; and   there were   on the chapiter round about network and pomegranates, all of brass: and correspondingly the second pillar   had   eight pomegranates to a cubit for the twelve cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  023" id="52  023" >23</span>
 And the pomegranates were ninety-six on a side; and all the pomegranates on the network round about were a hundred.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  024" id="52  024" >24</span>
 And the captain of the guard took the chief priest, and the second priest, and those that kept the way;  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  025" id="52  025" >25</span>
 and one eunuch, who was over the men of war, and seven men of renown, who were in the king's presence that were found in the city; and the scribe of the forces, who did the part of a scribe to the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  026" id="52  026" >26</span>
 And Nabuzardan the captain of the king's guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Deblatha.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  027" id="52  027" >27</span>
 And the king of Babylon struck them in Deblatha, in the land of Aemath.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  031" id="52  031" >31</span>
 And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year after that Joakim king of Juda had been carried away captive, in the twelfth month, on the four and twentieth   day   of the month,   that   Ulaemadachar king of Babylon, in the year in which he began to reign, raised the head of Joakim king of Juda, and shaved him, and brought him out of the house where he was kept,  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  032" id="52  032" >32</span>
 and spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the kings that were with him in Babylon,  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  033" id="52  033" >33</span>
 and changed his prison garments: and he ate bread continually before him all the days that he lived.  <span class="verse" rel="v02452  034" id="52  034" >34</span>
 And his appointed portion was given him continually by the king of Babylon from day to day, until the day when he died.
