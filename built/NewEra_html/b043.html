<p class="smallcappara"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hereas many and great things have been delivered to us by the law and the prophets, and by others that have followed their steps, for the which things Israel ought to be commended for learning and wisdom; and whereof not only the readers must needs become skillful themselves, but also they that desire to learn be able to profit them which are without, both by speaking and writing: my grandfather Jesus, when he had much given himself to the reading of the law, and the prophets, and other books of our fathers, and had gotten therein good judgment, was drawn on also himself to write something pertaining to learning and wisdom; to the intent that those which are desirous to learn, and are addicted to these things, might profit much more in living according to the law. Therefore let me entreat you to read it with favor and attention, and to pardon us, wherein we may seem to come short of some words, which we have laboured to interpret. For the same things uttered in Hebrew, and translated into another tongue, have not the same force in them: and not only these things, but the law itself, and the prophets, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their own language. For in the eight and thirties year coming into Egypt, when Euergetes was king, and continuing there some time, I found a book of no small learning: therefore I thought it most necessary for me to bestow some diligence and travail to interpret it; using great watchfulness and skill in that space to bring the book to an end, and set it forth for them also, which in a strange country are willing to learn, being prepared before in manners to live after the law.

<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span> All wisdom   comes   from the Lord, and is with him for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 Who can number the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain, and the days of eternity?  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 Who can find out the height of heaven, and the breadth of the earth, and the deep, and wisdom?  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 Wisdom has been created before all things, and the understanding of prudence from everlasting.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 The word of God most high is the fountain of wisdom; and her ways are everlasting commandments.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 To whom has the root of wisdom been revealed? or who has known her wise counsels?  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
    To whom has the knowledge of wisdom been made manifest? and who has understood her great experience?    <span class="verse" rel="v0431  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 There is one wise and greatly to be feared, the Lord sitting upon his throne.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 He created her, and saw her, and numbered her, and poured her out upon all his works.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 She is with all flesh according to his gift, and he has given her to them that love him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 The fear of the Lord is honor, and glory, and gladness, and a crown of rejoicing.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 The fear of the Lord makes a merry heart, and gives joy, and gladness, and a long life.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 Whoso fears the Lord, it shall go well with him at the last, and he shall find favor in the day of his death.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and it was created with the faithful in the womb.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 She has built an everlasting foundation with men, and she shall continue with their seed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 To fear the Lord is fulness of wisdom, and fills men with her fruits.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 She fills all their house with things desirable, and the garners with her increase.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 The fear of the Lord is a crown of wisdom, making peace and perfect health to flourish; both which are the gifts of God: and it enlarges their rejoicing that love him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 Wisdom rains down skill and knowledge of understanding standing, and exalts them to honor that hold her fast.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and the branches thereof are long life.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  021" id="1  021" >21</span>
 The fear of the Lord drives away sins: and where it is present, it turns away wrath.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  022" id="1  022" >22</span>
 A furious man can’t be justified; for the sway of his fury shall be his destruction.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  023" id="1  023" >23</span>
 A patient man will tear for a time, and afterward joy shall spring up to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  024" id="1  024" >24</span>
 He will hide his words for a time, and the lips of many shall declare his wisdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  025" id="1  025" >25</span>
 The parables of knowledge are in the treasures of wisdom: but godliness is an abomination to a sinner.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  026" id="1  026" >26</span>
 If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments, and the Lord shall give her to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  027" id="1  027" >27</span>
 For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction: and faith and meekness are his delight.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  028" id="1  028" >28</span>
 Distrust not the fear of the Lord when you are poor: and come not to him with a double heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  029" id="1  029" >29</span>
 Be not an hypocrite in the sight of men, and take good heed what you speak.  <span class="verse" rel="v0431  030" id="1  030" >30</span>
 Exalt not yourself, lest you fall, and bring dishonor upon your soul, and so God discover your secrets, and cast you down in the midst of the congregation, because you came not in truth to the fear of the Lord, but your heart is full of deceit.  
<!-- 2   030 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> My son, if you come to serve the Lord, prepare your soul for temptation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0432  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 Set your heart aright, and constantly endure, and make not haste in time of trouble.  <span class="verse" rel="v0432  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 Cleave to him, and depart not away, that you may be increased at your last end.  <span class="verse" rel="v0432  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 Whatsoever is brought upon you take cheerfully, and be patient when you are changed to a low estate.  <span class="verse" rel="v0432  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 For gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of adversity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0432  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 Believe in him, and he will help you; order your way aright, and trust in him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0432  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 You° that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; and go not aside, lest you° fall.  <span class="verse" rel="v0432  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 You° that fear the Lord, believe him; and your reward shall not fail.  <span class="verse" rel="v0432  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 You° that fear the Lord, hope for good, and for everlasting joy and mercy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0432  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 Look at the generations of old, and see; did ever any trust in the Lord, and was confounded? or did any abide in his fear, and was forsaken? or whom did he ever despise, that called upon him?  <span class="verse" rel="v0432  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy, longsuffering, and very pitiful, and forgives sins, and saves in time of affliction.  <span class="verse" rel="v0432  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 Woe be to fearful hearts, and faint hands, and the sinner that goes two ways!  <span class="verse" rel="v0432  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 Woe to him that is faint-hearted! for he believes not; therefore shall he not be defended.  <span class="verse" rel="v0432  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 Woe to you that have lost patience! and what will you° do when the Lord shall visit you?  <span class="verse" rel="v0432  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 They that fear the Lord will not disobey his Word; and they that love him will keep his ways.  <span class="verse" rel="v0432  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 They that fear the Lord will seek that which is well, pleasing to him; and they that love him shall be filled with the law.  <span class="verse" rel="v0432  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 They that fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, and humble their souls in his sight,  <span class="verse" rel="v0432  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 Saying, We will fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men: for as his majesty is, so is his mercy.  
<!-- 3   018 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> Hear me your father, O children, and do thereafter, that you° may be safe.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 For the Lord has given the father honor over the children, and has confirmed the authority of the mother over the sons.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 Whoso honors his father makes an atonement for his sins:  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 And he that honors his mother is as one that lays up treasure.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 Whoso honors his father shall have joy of his own children; and when he makes his prayer, he shall be heard.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 He that honors his father shall have a long life; and he that is obedient to the Lord shall be a comfort to his mother.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 He that fears the Lord will honor his father, and will do service to his parents, as to his masters.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 Honor your father and mother both in word and deed, that a blessing may come upon you from them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 For the blessing of the father establishes the houses of children; but the curse of the mother roots out foundations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 Glory not in the dishonor of your father; for your father's dishonor is no glory to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 For the glory of a man is from the honor of his father; and a mother in dishonor is a reproach to the children.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 My son, help your father in his age, and grieve him not as long as he lives.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 And if his understanding fail, have patience with him; and despise him not when you are in your full strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 For the relieving of your father shall not be forgotten: and instead of sins it shall be added to build you up.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 In the day of your affliction it shall be remembered; your sins also shall melt away, as the ice in the fair warm weather.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 He that forsakes his father is as a blasphemer; and he that angers his mother is cursed: of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 My son, go on with your business in meekness; so shall you be beloved of him that is approved.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 The greater you are, the more humble yourself, and you shall find favor before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  019" id="3  019" >19</span>
 Many are in high place, and of renown: but mysteries are revealed to the meek.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  020" id="3  020" >20</span>
 For the power of the Lord is great, and he is honored of the lowly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  021" id="3  021" >21</span>
 Seek not out things that are too hard for you, neither search the things that are above your strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  022" id="3  022" >22</span>
 But what is commanded you, think thereupon with reverence, for it is not needful for you to see with your eyes the things that are in secret.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  023" id="3  023" >23</span>
 Be not curious in unnecessary matters: for more things are showed to you than men understand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  024" id="3  024" >24</span>
 For many are deceived by their own vain opinion; and an evil suspicion has overthrown their judgment.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  025" id="3  025" >25</span>
 Without eyes you shall lack light: profess not the knowledge therefore that you have not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  026" id="3  026" >26</span>
 A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; and he that loves danger shall perish therein.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  027" id="3  027" >27</span>
 An obstinate heart shall be laden with sorrows; and the wicked man shall heap sin upon sin.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  028" id="3  028" >28</span>
 In the punishment of the proud there is no remedy; for the plant of wickedness has taken root in him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  029" id="3  029" >29</span>
 The heart of the prudent will understand a parable; and an attentive ear is the desire of a wise man.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  030" id="3  030" >30</span>
 Water will quench a flaming fire; and alms makes an atonement for sins.  <span class="verse" rel="v0433  031" id="3  031" >31</span>
 And he that requites good turns is mindful of that which may come hereafter; and when he falls, he shall find a stay.  
<!-- 4   031 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> My son, defraud not the poor of his living, and make not the needy eyes to wait long.  <span class="verse" rel="v0434  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 Make not an hungry soul sorrowful; neither provoke a man in his distress.  <span class="verse" rel="v0434  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 Add not more trouble to an heart that is vexed; and defer not to give to him that is in need.  <span class="verse" rel="v0434  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 Reject not the supplication of the afflicted; neither turn away your face from a poor man.  <span class="verse" rel="v0434  005" id="4  005" >5</span>

 A wicked soul shall destroy him that has it, and shall make him to be laughed to scorn of his enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  005" id="6  005" >5</span>
 Sweet language will multiply friends: and a fairspeaking tongue will increase kind greetings.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  006" id="6  006" >6</span>
 Be in peace with many: nevertheless have but one counsellor of a thousand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  007" id="6  007" >7</span>
 If you would get a friend, prove him first and be not hasty to credit him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  008" id="6  008" >8</span>
 For some man is a friend for his own occasion, and will not abide in the day of your trouble.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  009" id="6  009" >9</span>
 And there is a friend, who being turned to enmity, and strife will discover your reproach.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  010" id="6  010" >10</span>
 Again, some friend is a companion at the table, and will not continue in the day of your affliction.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  011" id="6  011" >11</span>
 But in your prosperity he will be as yourself, and will be bold over your servants.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  012" id="6  012" >12</span>
 If you be brought low, he will be against you, and will hide himself from your face.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  013" id="6  013" >13</span>
 Separate yourself from your enemies, and take heed of your friends.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  014" id="6  014" >14</span>
 A faithful friend is a strong defence: and he that has found such an one has found a treasure.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  015" id="6  015" >15</span>
 Nothing does countervail a faithful friend, and his excellency is invaluable.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  016" id="6  016" >16</span>
 A faithful friend is the medicine of life; and they that fear the Lord shall find him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  017" id="6  017" >17</span>

 She is very unpleasant to the unlearned: he that is without understanding will not remain with her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  021" id="6  021" >21</span>
 She will lie upon him as a mighty stone of trial; and he will cast her from him ere it be long.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  022" id="6  022" >22</span>
 For wisdom is according to her name, and she is not manifest to many.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  023" id="6  023" >23</span>
 Give ear, my son, receive my advice, and refuse not my counsel,  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  024" id="6  024" >24</span>
 And put your feet into her fetters, and your neck into her chain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  025" id="6  025" >25</span>
 Bow down your shoulder, and bear her, and be not grieved with her bonds.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  026" id="6  026" >26</span>

 Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for you, and her chains a robe of glory.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  030" id="6  030" >30</span>
 For there is a golden ornament upon her, and her bands are purple lace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  031" id="6  031" >31</span>
 You shall put her on as a robe of honor, and shall put her about you as a crown of joy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  032" id="6  032" >32</span>
 My son, if you will, you shall be taught: and if you will apply your mind, you shall be prudent.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  033" id="6  033" >33</span>
 If you love to hear, you shall receive understanding: and if you bow your ear, you shall be wise,  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  034" id="6  034" >34</span>
 Stand in the multitude of the elders; and cleave to him that is wise.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  035" id="6  035" >35</span>
 Be willing to hear every godly discourse; and let not the parables of understanding escape you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  036" id="6  036" >36</span>
 And if you see a man of understanding, get you betimes to him, and let your foot wear the steps of his door.  <span class="verse" rel="v0436  037" id="6  037" >37</span>
 Let your mind be upon the ordinances of the Lord and meditate continually in his commandments: he shall establish your heart, and give you wisdom at your owns desire.

 There is none worse than he that envies himself; and this is a recompence of his wickedness.  <span class="verse" rel="v04314  007" id="14  007" >7</span>
 And if he does good, he does it unwillingly; and at the last he will declare his wickedness.  <span class="verse" rel="v04314  008" id="14  008" >8</span>
 The envious man has a wicked eye; he turns away his face, and despises men.  <span class="verse" rel="v04314  009" id="14  009" >9</span>
 A covetous man's eye is not satisfied with his portion; and the iniquity of the wicked dries up his soul.  <span class="verse" rel="v04314  010" id="14  010" >10</span>
 A wicked eye envies   his   bread, and he is a niggard at his table.  <span class="verse" rel="v04314  011" id="14  011" >11</span>
 My son, according to your ability do good to yourself, and give the Lord his due offering.  <span class="verse" rel="v04314  012" id="14  012" >12</span>

 Defraud not yourself of the good day, and let not the part of a good desire overpass you.  <span class="verse" rel="v04314  015" id="14  015" >15</span>
 Shall you not leave your travails to another? and your labors to be divided by lot?  <span class="verse" rel="v04314  016" id="14  016" >16</span>
 Give, and take, and sanctify your soul; for there is no seeking of dainties in the grave.  <span class="verse" rel="v04314  017" id="14  017" >17</span>
 All flesh waxes old as a garment: for the covenant from the beginning is, You shall die the death.  <span class="verse" rel="v04314  018" id="14  018" >18</span>
 As of the green leaves on a thick tree, some fall, and some grow; so is the generation of flesh and blood, one comes to an end, and another is born.  <span class="verse" rel="v04314  019" id="14  019" >19</span>
 Every work rots and consumes away, and the worker thereof shall go withal.  <span class="verse" rel="v04314  020" id="14  020" >20</span>
 Blessed is the man that does meditate good things in wisdom, and that reasons of holy things by his understanding.  <span class="verse" rel="v04314  021" id="14  021" >21</span>
 He that considers her ways in his heart shall also have understanding in her secrets.  <span class="verse" rel="v04314  022" id="14  022" >22</span>
 Go after her as one that traces, and lie in wait in her ways.  <span class="verse" rel="v04314  023" id="14  023" >23</span>
 He that pries in at her windows shall also listen at her doors.  <span class="verse" rel="v04314  024" id="14  024" >24</span>
 He that does lodge near her house shall also fasten a pin in her walls.  <span class="verse" rel="v04314  025" id="14  025" >25</span>
 He shall pitch his tent near to her, and shall lodge in a lodging where good things are.  <span class="verse" rel="v04314  026" id="14  026" >26</span>
 He shall set his children under her shelter, and shall lodge under her branches.  <span class="verse" rel="v04314  027" id="14  027" >27</span>
 By her he shall be covered from heat, and in her glory shall he dwell.

 For she is far from pride, and men that are liars can’t remember her.  <span class="verse" rel="v04315  009" id="15  009" >9</span>
 Praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner, for it was not sent him of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v04315  010" id="15  010" >10</span>

 Say not you, He has caused me to err: for he has no need of the sinful man.  <span class="verse" rel="v04315  013" id="15  013" >13</span>
 The Lord hates all abomination; and they that fear God love it not.  <span class="verse" rel="v04315  014" id="15  014" >14</span>
 He himself made man from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his counsel;  <span class="verse" rel="v04315  015" id="15  015" >15</span>

 Trust not you in their life, neither respect their multitude: for one that is just is better than a thousand; and better it is to die without children, than to have them that are ungodly.  <span class="verse" rel="v04316  004" id="16  004" >4</span>
 For by one that has understanding shall the city be replenished: but the kindred of the wicked shall speedily become desolate.  <span class="verse" rel="v04316  005" id="16  005" >5</span>
 Many such things have I seen with my eyes, and my ear has heard greater things than these.  <span class="verse" rel="v04316  006" id="16  006" >6</span>
 In the congregation of the ungodly shall a fire be kindled; and in a rebellious nation wrath is set on fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v04316  007" id="16  007" >7</span>
 He was not pacified toward the old giants, who fell away in the strength of their foolishness.  <span class="verse" rel="v04316  008" id="16  008" >8</span>
 Neither spared he the place where Lot sojourned, but abhorred them for their pride.  <span class="verse" rel="v04316  009" id="16  009" >9</span>
 He pitied not the people of perdition, who were taken away in their sins:  <span class="verse" rel="v04316  010" id="16  010" >10</span>
 Nor the six hundred thousand footmen, who were gathered together in the hardness of their hearts.  <span class="verse" rel="v04316  011" id="16  011" >11</span>
 And if there be one stiff-necked among the people, it is marvel if he escape unpunished: for mercy and wrath are with him; he is mighty to forgive, and to pour out displeasure.  <span class="verse" rel="v04316  012" id="16  012" >12</span>

 He gave them few days, and a short time, and power also over the things therein.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  003" id="17  003" >3</span>
 He endued them with strength by themselves, and made them according to his image,  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  004" id="17  004" >4</span>
 And put the fear of man upon all flesh, and gave him dominion over beasts and fowls.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  005" id="17  005" >5</span>
    They received the use of the five operations of the Lord, and in the sixth place he imparted them understanding, and in the seventh speech, an interpreter of the cogitations thereof.    <span class="verse" rel="v04317  006" id="17  006" >6</span>
 Counsel, and a tongue, and eyes, ears, and a heart, gave he them to understand.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  007" id="17  007" >7</span>
 Withal he filled them with the knowledge of understanding, and showed them good and evil.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  008" id="17  008" >8</span>
 He set his eye upon their hearts, that he might show them the greatness of his works.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  009" id="17  009" >9</span>
 He gave them to glory in his marvelous acts for ever, that they might declare his works with understanding.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  010" id="17  010" >10</span>
 And the elect shall praise his holy name.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  011" id="17  011" >11</span>
 Beside this he gave them knowledge, and the law of life for an heritage.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  012" id="17  012" >12</span>
 He made an everlasting covenant with them, and showed them his judgments.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  013" id="17  013" >13</span>
 Their eyes saw the majesty of his glory, and their ears heard his glorious voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  014" id="17  014" >14</span>
 And he said to them, Beware of all unrighteousness; and he gave every man commandment concerning his neighbor.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  015" id="17  015" >15</span>
 Their ways are ever before him, and shall not be hid from his eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  016" id="17  016" >16</span>
 Every man from his youth is given to evil; neither could they make to themselves fleshy hearts for stony.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  017" id="17  017" >17</span>

 Whom, being his firstborn, he nourishes with discipline, and giving him the light of his love does not forsake him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  019" id="17  019" >19</span>

 None of their unrighteous deeds are hid from him, but all their sins are before the Lord  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  021" id="17  021" >21</span>
 But the Lord being gracious and knowing his workmanship, neither left nor forsook them, but spared them.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  022" id="17  022" >22</span>
 The alms of a man is as a signet with him, and he will keep the good deeds of man as the apple of the eye, and give repentance to his sons and daughters.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  023" id="17  023" >23</span>
 Afterwards he will rise up and reward them, and render their recompence upon their heads.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  024" id="17  024" >24</span>
 But to them that repent, he granted them return, and comforted those that failed in patience.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  025" id="17  025" >25</span>
 Return to the Lord, and forsake your sins, make your prayer before his face, and offend less.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  026" id="17  026" >26</span>
 Turn again to the most High, and turn away from iniquity: for he will lead you out of darkness into the light of health, and hate you abomination vehemently.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  027" id="17  027" >27</span>
 Who shall praise the most High in the grave, instead of them which live and give thanks?  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  028" id="17  028" >28</span>
 Thanksgiving perishes from the dead, as from one that is not: the living and sound in heart shall praise the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  029" id="17  029" >29</span>
 How great is the lovingkindness of the Lord our God, and his compassion to such as turn to him in holiness!  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  030" id="17  030" >30</span>
 For all things can’t be in men, because the son of man is not immortal.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  031" id="17  031" >31</span>
 What is brighter than the sun? yet the light thereof fails; and flesh and blood will imagine evil.  <span class="verse" rel="v04317  032" id="17  032" >32</span>

 There is that for bashfulness promises to his friend, and makes him his enemy for nothing.  <span class="verse" rel="v04320  024" id="20  024" >24</span>
 A lie is a foul blot in a man, yet it is continually in the mouth of the untaught.  <span class="verse" rel="v04320  025" id="20  025" >25</span>
 A thief is better than a man that is accustomed to lie: but they both shall have destruction to heritage.  <span class="verse" rel="v04320  026" id="20  026" >26</span>

 Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and stop up his mouth that he can’t reprove.  <span class="verse" rel="v04320  030" id="20  030" >30</span>
 Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is hoarded up, what profit is in them both?  <span class="verse" rel="v04320  031" id="20  031" >31</span>
 Better is he that hides his folly than a man that hides his wisdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v04320  032" id="20  032" >32</span>

 All iniquity is as a two edged sword, the wounds whereof can’t be healed.  <span class="verse" rel="v04321  004" id="21  004" >4</span>
 To terrify and do wrong will waste riches: thus the house of proud men shall be made desolate.  <span class="verse" rel="v04321  005" id="21  005" >5</span>

 An eloquent man is known far and near; but a man of understanding knows when he slips.  <span class="verse" rel="v04321  008" id="21  008" >8</span>
 He that builds his house with other men's money is like one that gathers himself stones for the tomb of his burial.  <span class="verse" rel="v04321  009" id="21  009" >9</span>
 The congregation of the wicked is like tow wrapped together: and the end of them is a flame of fire to destroy them.  <span class="verse" rel="v04321  010" id="21  010" >10</span>

 He that is not wise will not be taught: but there is a wisdom which multiplies bitterness.  <span class="verse" rel="v04321  013" id="21  013" >13</span>
 The knowledge of a wise man shall abound like a flood: and his counsel is like a pure fountain of life.  <span class="verse" rel="v04321  014" id="21  014" >14</span>
 The inner parts of a fool are like a broken vessel, and he will hold no knowledge as long as he lives.  <span class="verse" rel="v04321  015" id="21  015" >15</span>
 If a skillful man hear a wise word, he will commend it, and add to it: but as soon as one of no understanding hears it, it displeases him, and he casts it behind his back.  <span class="verse" rel="v04321  016" id="21  016" >16</span>
 The talking of a fool is like a burden in the way: but grace shall be found in the lips of the wise.  <span class="verse" rel="v04321  017" id="21  017" >17</span>

 Doctrine to fools is as fetters on the feet, and like manacles on the right hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v04321  020" id="21  020" >20</span>
 A fool lifts up his voice with laughter; but a wise man does scarce smile a little.  <span class="verse" rel="v04321  021" id="21  021" >21</span>
 Learning is to a wise man as an ornament of gold, and like a bracelet upon his right arm.  <span class="verse" rel="v04321  022" id="21  022" >22</span>
 A foolish man's foot is soon in his   neighbor's   house: but a man of experience is ashamed of him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04321  023" id="21  023" >23</span>
 A fool will peep in at the door into the house: but he that is well nurtured will stand without.  <span class="verse" rel="v04321  024" id="21  024" >24</span>
 It is the rudeness of a man to listen at the door: but a wise man will be grieved with the disgrace.  <span class="verse" rel="v04321  025" id="21  025" >25</span>
 The lips of talkers will be telling such things as pertain not to them: but the words of such as have understanding are weighed in the balance.  <span class="verse" rel="v04321  026" id="21  026" >26</span>

 An evil-nurtured man is the dishonor of his father that became the father of him: and a   foolish   daughter is born to his loss.  <span class="verse" rel="v04322  004" id="22  004" >4</span>
 A wise daughter shall bring an inheritance to her husband: but she that lives dishonestly is her father's heaviness.  <span class="verse" rel="v04322  005" id="22  005" >5</span>

 If children live honestly, and have wherewithal, they shall cover the baseness of their parents.  <span class="verse" rel="v04322  010" id="22  010" >10</span>
 But children, being haughty, through disdain and lack of nurture do stain the nobility of their kindred.  <span class="verse" rel="v04322  011" id="22  011" >11</span>
 Weep for the dead, for he has lost the light: and weep for the fool, for he lacks understanding: make little weeping for the dead, for he is at rest: but the life of the fool is worse than death.  <span class="verse" rel="v04322  012" id="22  012" >12</span>
 Seven days do men mourn for him that is dead; but for a fool and an ungodly man all the days of his life.  <span class="verse" rel="v04322  013" id="22  013" >13</span>
 Talk not much with a fool, and go not to him that has no understanding: beware of him, lest you have trouble, and you shall never be defiled with his fooleries: depart from him, and you shall find rest, and never be disquieted with madness.  <span class="verse" rel="v04322  014" id="22  014" >14</span>

 Sand, and salt, and a mass of iron, is easier to bear, than a man without understanding.  <span class="verse" rel="v04322  016" id="22  016" >16</span>
 As timber girded and bound together in a building can’t be loosed with shaking: so the heart that is established by advised counsel shall fear at no time.  <span class="verse" rel="v04322  017" id="22  017" >17</span>
 A heart settled upon a thought of understanding is as a fair plaistering on the wall of a gallery.  <span class="verse" rel="v04322  018" id="22  018" >18</span>
 Pales set on an high place will never stand against the wind: so a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool can’t stand against any fear.  <span class="verse" rel="v04322  019" id="22  019" >19</span>

 Though you drew a sword at your friend, yet despair not: for there may be a returning   to favor.    <span class="verse" rel="v04322  022" id="22  022" >22</span>

 Be faithful to your neighbor in his poverty, that you may rejoice in his prosperity: abide stedfast to him in the time of his trouble, that you may be heir with him in his heritage: for a mean estate is not always to be contemned: nor the rich that is foolish to be had in admiration.  <span class="verse" rel="v04322  024" id="22  024" >24</span>

 Hear, O you° children, the discipline of the mouth: he that keeps it shall never be taken in his lips.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  008" id="23  008" >8</span>
 The sinner shall be left in his foolishness: both the evil speaker and the proud shall fall thereby.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  009" id="23  009" >9</span>
 Accustom not your mouth to swearing; neither use yourself to the naming of the Holy One.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  010" id="23  010" >10</span>
 For as a servant that is continually beaten shall not be without a blue mark: so he that swears and names God continually shall not be faultless.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  011" id="23  011" >11</span>
 A man that uses much swearing shall be filled with iniquity, and the plague shall never depart from his house: if he shall offend, his sin shall be upon him: and if he acknowledge not his sin, he makes a double offense: and if he swear in vain, he shall not be innocent, but his house shall be full of calamities.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  012" id="23  012" >12</span>
 There is a word that is clothed about with death: God grant that it be not found in the heritage of Jacob; for all such things shall be far from the godly, and they shall not wallow in their sins.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  013" id="23  013" >13</span>
 Use not your mouth to intemperate swearing, for therein is the word of sin.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  014" id="23  014" >14</span>
 Remember your father and your mother, when you sit among great men. Be not forgetful before them, and so you by your custom become a fool, and wish that you had not been born, and curse they day of your nativity.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  015" id="23  015" >15</span>
 The man that is accustomed to opprobrious words will never be reformed all the days of his life.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  016" id="23  016" >16</span>
 Two sorts of men multiply sin, and the third will bring wrath: a hot mind is as a burning fire, it will never be quenched till it be consumed: a fornicator in the body of his flesh will never cease till he has kindled a fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  017" id="23  017" >17</span>
 All bread is sweet to a whoremonger, he will not leave off till he die.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  018" id="23  018" >18</span>
 A man that breaks wedlock, saying thus in his heart, Who sees me? I am compassed about with darkness, the walls cover me, and no body sees me; what need I to fear? the most High will not remember my sins:  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  019" id="23  019" >19</span>
 Such a man only fears the eyes of men, and knows not that the eyes of the Lord are ten thousand times brighter than the sun, beholding all the ways of men, and considering the most secret parts.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  020" id="23  020" >20</span>
 He knew all things ere ever they were created; so also after they were perfected he looked upon them all.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  021" id="23  021" >21</span>
 This man shall be punished in the streets of the city, and where he suspects not he shall be taken.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  022" id="23  022" >22</span>
 Thus shall it go also with the wife that leaves her husband, and brings in an heir by another.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  023" id="23  023" >23</span>
 For first, she has disobeyed the law of the most High; and secondly, she has trespassed against her own husband; and thirdly, she has played the whore in adultery, and brought children by another man.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  024" id="23  024" >24</span>
 She shall be brought out into the congregation, and inquisition shall be made of her children.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  025" id="23  025" >25</span>
 Her children shall not take root, and her branches shall bring forth no fruit.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  026" id="23  026" >26</span>
 She shall leave her memory to be cursed, and her reproach shall not be blotted out.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  027" id="23  027" >27</span>
 And they that remain shall know that there is nothing better than the fear of the Lord, and that there is nothing sweeter than to take heed to the commandments of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v04323  028" id="23  028" >28</span>
 It is great glory to follow the Lord, and to be received of him is long life.

 In the congregation of the most High shall she open her mouth, and triumph before his power.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  003" id="24  003" >3</span>
 I came out of the mouth of the most High, and covered the earth as a cloud.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  004" id="24  004" >4</span>
 I lived in high places, and my throne is in a cloudy pillar.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  005" id="24  005" >5</span>
 I alone compassed the circuit of heaven, and walked in the bottom of the deep.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  006" id="24  006" >6</span>
 In the waves of the sea and in all the earth, and in every people and nation, I got a possession.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  007" id="24  007" >7</span>
 With all these I sought rest: and in whose inheritance shall I abide?  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  008" id="24  008" >8</span>
 So the Creator of all things gave me a commandment, and he that made me caused my tabernacle to rest, and said, Let your dwelling be in Jacob, and your inheritance in Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  009" id="24  009" >9</span>
 He created me from the beginning before the world, and I shall never fail.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  010" id="24  010" >10</span>
 In the holy tabernacle I served before him; and so was I established in Sion.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  011" id="24  011" >11</span>
 Likewise in the beloved city he gave me rest, and in Jerusalem was my power.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  012" id="24  012" >12</span>
 And I took root in an honorable people, even in the portion of the Lord's inheritance.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  013" id="24  013" >13</span>
 I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress tree upon the mountains of Hermon.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  014" id="24  014" >14</span>
 I was exalted like a palm tree in En-gaddi, and as a rose plant in Jericho, as a fair olive tree in a pleasant field, and grew up as a plane tree by the water.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  015" id="24  015" >15</span>
 I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon and aspalathus, and I yielded a pleasant odour like the best myrrh, as galbanum, and onyx, and sweet storax, and as the fume of frankincense in the tabernacle.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  016" id="24  016" >16</span>
 As the turpentine tree I stretched out my branches, and my branches are the branches of honor and grace.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  017" id="24  017" >17</span>
 As the vine brought I forth pleasant savor, and my flowers are the fruit of honor and riches.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  018" id="24  018" >18</span>
 I am the mother of fair love, and fear, and knowledge, and holy hope: I therefore, being eternal, am given to all my children which are named of him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  019" id="24  019" >19</span>
 Come to me, all you° that be desirous of me, and fill yourselves with my fruits.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  020" id="24  020" >20</span>
 For my memorial is sweeter than honey, and my inheritance than the honeycomb.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  021" id="24  021" >21</span>
 They that eat me shall yet be hungry, and they that drink me shall yet be thirsty.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  022" id="24  022" >22</span>
 He that obeys me shall never be confounded, and they that work by me shall not do amiss.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  023" id="24  023" >23</span>
 All these things are the book of the covenant of the most high God, even the law which Moses commanded for an heritage to the congregations of Jacob.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  024" id="24  024" >24</span>
 Faint not to be strong in the Lord; that he may confirm you, cleave to him: for the Lord Almighty is God alone, and beside him there is no other Saviour.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  025" id="24  025" >25</span>
 He fills all things with his wisdom, as Phison and as Tigris in the time of the new fruits.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  026" id="24  026" >26</span>
 He makes the understanding to abound like Euphrates, and as Jordan in the time of the harvest.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  027" id="24  027" >27</span>
 He makes the doctrine of knowledge appear as the light, and as Geon in the time of vintage.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  028" id="24  028" >28</span>
 The first man knew her not perfectly: no more shall the last find her out.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  029" id="24  029" >29</span>
 For her thoughts are more than the sea, and her counsels profounder than the great deep.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  030" id="24  030" >30</span>
 I also came out as a brook from a river, and as a conduit into a garden.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  031" id="24  031" >31</span>
 I said, I will water my best garden, and will water abundantly my garden bed: and, behold, my brook became a river, and my river became a sea.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  032" id="24  032" >32</span>
 I will yet make doctrine to shine as the morning, and will send forth her light afar off.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  033" id="24  033" >33</span>
 I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy, and leave it to all ages for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v04324  034" id="24  034" >34</span>
 Behold that I have not laboured for myself only, but for all them that seek wisdom.

<p><span class="chapter" id="25  001">25  </span> In three things I was beautified, and stood up beautiful both before God and men: the unity of brethren, the love of neighbors, a man and a wife that agree together.  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  002" id="25  002" >2</span>
 Three sorts of men my soul hates, and I am greatly offended at their life: a poor man that is proud, a rich man that is a liar, and an old adulterer that doats.  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  003" id="25  003" >3</span>
 If you have gathered nothing in your youth, how can you find any thing in your age?  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  004" id="25  004" >4</span>
 O how comely a thing is judgment for gray hairs, and for ancient men to know counsel!  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  005" id="25  005" >5</span>
 O how comely is the wisdom of old men, and understanding and counsel to men of honor.  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  006" id="25  006" >6</span>
 Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory.  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  007" id="25  007" >7</span>
 There be nine things which I have judged in my heart to be happy, and the tenth I will utter with my tongue: A man that has joy of his children; and he that lives to see the fall of his enemy:  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  008" id="25  008" >8</span>
 Well is him that dwells with a wife of understanding, and that has not slipped with his tongue, and that has not served a man more unworthy than himself:  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  009" id="25  009" >9</span>
 Well is him that has found prudence, and he that speaks in the ears of them that will hear:  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  010" id="25  010" >10</span>
 O how great is he that finds wisdom! yet is there none above him that fears the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  011" id="25  011" >11</span>
 But the love of the Lord passes all things for illumination: he that holds it, whereto shall he be likened?  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  012" id="25  012" >12</span>
 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of his love: and faith is the beginning of cleaving to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  013" id="25  013" >13</span>
    Give me   any plague, but the plague of the heart: and any wickedness, but the wickedness of a woman:  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  014" id="25  014" >14</span>
 And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate me: and any revenge, but the revenge of enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  015" id="25  015" >15</span>
 There is no head above the head of a serpent; and there is no wrath above the wrath of an enemy.  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  016" id="25  016" >16</span>
 I had rather dwell with a lion and a dragon, than to keep house with a wicked woman.  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  017" id="25  017" >17</span>
 The wickedness of a woman changes her face, and darkens her countenance like sackcloth.  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  018" id="25  018" >18</span>
 Her husband shall sit among his neighbors; and when he hears it shall sigh bitterly.  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  019" id="25  019" >19</span>
 All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman: let the portion of a sinner fall upon her.  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  020" id="25  020" >20</span>
 As the climbing up a sandy way is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of words to a quiet man.  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  021" id="25  021" >21</span>
 Stumble not at the beauty of a woman, and desire her not for pleasure.  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  022" id="25  022" >22</span>
 A woman, if she maintain her husband, is full of anger, impudence, and much reproach.  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  023" id="25  023" >23</span>
 A wicked woman abates the courage, makes an heavy countenance and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort her husband in distress makes weak hands and feeble knees.  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  024" id="25  024" >24</span>
 Of the woman came the beginning of sin, and through her we all die.  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  025" id="25  025" >25</span>
 Give the water no passage; neither a wicked woman liberty to gad abroad.  <span class="verse" rel="v04325  026" id="25  026" >26</span>
 If she go not as you would have her, cut her off from your flesh, and give her a bill of divorce, and let her go.

 A virtuous woman rejoices her husband, and he shall fulfil the years of his life in peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  003" id="26  003" >3</span>
 A good wife is a good portion, which shall be given in the portion of them that fear the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  004" id="26  004" >4</span>
 Whether a man be rich or poor, if he have a good heart toward the Lord, he shall at all times rejoice with a cheerful countenance.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  005" id="26  005" >5</span>
 There be three things that my heart fears; and for the fourth I was sore afraid: the slander of a city, the gathering together of an unruly multitude, and a false accusation: all these are worse than death.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  006" id="26  006" >6</span>
 But a grief of heart and sorrow is a woman that is jealous over another woman, and a scourge of the tongue which communicates with all.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  007" id="26  007" >7</span>
 An evil wife is a yoke shaken to and fro: he that has hold of her is as though he held a scorpion.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  008" id="26  008" >8</span>
 A drunken woman and a gadder abroad causes great anger, and she will not cover her own shame.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  009" id="26  009" >9</span>
 The whoredom of a woman may be known in her haughty looks and eyelids.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  010" id="26  010" >10</span>
 If your daughter be shameless, keep her in straitly, lest she abuse herself through overmuch liberty.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  011" id="26  011" >11</span>
 Watch over an impudent eye: and marvel not if she trespass against you.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  012" id="26  012" >12</span>
 She will open her mouth, as a thirsty traveller when he has found a fountain, and drink of every water near her: by every hedge will she sit down, and open her quiver against every arrow.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  013" id="26  013" >13</span>
 The grace of a wife delights her husband, and her discretion will fatten his bones.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  014" id="26  014" >14</span>
 A silent and loving woman is a gift of the Lord; and there is nothing so much worth as a mind well instructed.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  015" id="26  015" >15</span>
 A shamefaced and faithful woman is a double grace, and her continent mind can’t be valued.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  016" id="26  016" >16</span>
 As the sun when it arises in the high heaven; so is the beauty of a good wife in the ordering of her house.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  017" id="26  017" >17</span>
 As the clear light is upon the holy candlestick; so is the beauty of the face in ripe age.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  018" id="26  018" >18</span>
 As the golden pillars are upon the sockets of silver; so are the fair feet with a constant heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  019" id="26  019" >19</span>
 My son, keep the flower of your age sound; and give not your strength to strangers.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  020" id="26  020" >20</span>
 When you have gotten a fruitful possession through all the field, sow it with your own seed, trusting in the goodness of your stock.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  021" id="26  021" >21</span>
 So your race which you leave shall be magnified, having the confidence of their good descent.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  022" id="26  022" >22</span>
 An harlot shall be accounted as spittle; but a married woman is a tower against death to her husband.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  023" id="26  023" >23</span>
 A wicked woman is given as a portion to a wicked man: but a godly woman is given to him that fears the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  024" id="26  024" >24</span>
 A dishonest woman contemns shame: but an honest woman will reverence her husband.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  025" id="26  025" >25</span>
 A shameless woman shall be counted as a dog; but she that is shamefaced will fear the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  026" id="26  026" >26</span>
 A woman that honors her husband shall be judged wise of all; but she that dishonors him in her pride shall be counted ungodly of all.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  027" id="26  027" >27</span>
 A loud crying woman and a scold shall be sought out to drive away the enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  028" id="26  028" >28</span>
 There be two things that grieve my heart; and the third makes me angry: a man of war that suffers poverty; and men of understanding that are not set by; and one that returns from righteousness to sin; the Lord prepares such an one for the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v04326  029" id="26  029" >29</span>
 A merchant shall hardly keep himself from doing wrong; and an huckster shall not be freed from sin.

 Love your friend, and be faithful to him: but if you betray his secrets, follow no more after him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04327  018" id="27  018" >18</span>

 Whoso digs a pit shall fall therein: and he that sets a trap shall be taken therein.  <span class="verse" rel="v04327  027" id="27  027" >27</span>
 He that works mischief, it shall fall upon him, and he shall not know whence it comes.  <span class="verse" rel="v04327  028" id="27  028" >28</span>
 Mockery and reproach are from the proud; but vengeance, as a lion, shall lie in wait for them.  <span class="verse" rel="v04327  029" id="27  029" >29</span>
 They that rejoice at the fall of the righteous shall be taken in the snare; and anguish shall consume them before they die.  <span class="verse" rel="v04327  030" id="27  030" >30</span>

 Keep your word, and deal faithfully with him, and you shall always find the thing that is necessary for you.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  004" id="29  004" >4</span>
 Many, when a thing was lent them, reckoned it to be found, and put them to trouble that helped them.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  005" id="29  005" >5</span>
 Till he has received, he will kiss a man's hand; and for his neighbor's money he will speak submissly: but when he should repay, he will prolong the time, and return words of grief, and complain of the time.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  006" id="29  006" >6</span>
 If he prevail, he shall hardly receive the half, and he will count as if he had found it: if not, he has deprived him of his money, and he has gotten him an enemy without cause: he pays him with cursings and railings; and for honor he will pay him disgrace.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  007" id="29  007" >7</span>
 Many therefore have refused to lend for other men's ill dealing, fearing to be defrauded.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  008" id="29  008" >8</span>
 Yet have you patience with a man in poor estate, and delay not to show him mercy.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  009" id="29  009" >9</span>
 Help the poor for the commandment's sake, and turn him not away because of his poverty.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  010" id="29  010" >10</span>
 Lose your money for your brother and your friend, and let it not rust under a stone to be lost.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  011" id="29  011" >11</span>
 Lay up your treasure according to the commandments of the most High, and it shall bring you more profit than gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  012" id="29  012" >12</span>
 Shut up alms in your storehouses: and it shall deliver you from all affliction.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  013" id="29  013" >13</span>
 It shall fight for you against your enemies better than a mighty shield and strong spear.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  014" id="29  014" >14</span>
 An honest man is surety for his neighbor: but he that is impudent will forsake him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  015" id="29  015" >15</span>
 Forget not the friendship of your surety, for he has given his life for you.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  016" id="29  016" >16</span>

 A wicked man transgressing the commandments of the Lord shall fall into suretiship: and he that undertakes and follows other men's business for gain shall fall into suits.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  020" id="29  020" >20</span>
 Help your neighbor according to your power, and beware that you yourself fall not into the same.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  021" id="29  021" >21</span>
 The chief thing for life is water, and bread, and clothing, and an house to cover shame.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  022" id="29  022" >22</span>
 Better is the life of a poor man in a mean cottage, than delicate fare in another man's house.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  023" id="29  023" >23</span>
 Be it little or much, hold you contented, that you hear not the reproach of your house.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  024" id="29  024" >24</span>
 For it is a miserable life to go from house to house: for where you are a stranger, you dare not open your mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  025" id="29  025" >25</span>
 You shall entertain, and feast, and have no thanks: moreover you shall hear bitter words:  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  026" id="29  026" >26</span>
 Come, you stranger, and furnish a table, and feed me of that you have ready.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  027" id="29  027" >27</span>
 Give place, you stranger, to an honorable man; my brother comes to be lodged, and I have need of my house.  <span class="verse" rel="v04329  028" id="29  028" >28</span>

 Speak, young man, if there be need of you: and yet scarcely when you are twice asked.  <span class="verse" rel="v04332  008" id="32  008" >8</span>
 Let your speech be short, comprehending much in few words; be as one that knows and yet holds his tongue.  <span class="verse" rel="v04332  009" id="32  009" >9</span>
 If you be among great men, make not yourself equal with them; and when ancient men are in place, use not many words.  <span class="verse" rel="v04332  010" id="32  010" >10</span>
 Before the thunder goes lightning; and before a shamefaced man shall go favor.  <span class="verse" rel="v04332  011" id="32  011" >11</span>
 Rise up betimes, and be not the last; but get you home without delay.  <span class="verse" rel="v04332  012" id="32  012" >12</span>
 There take your pastime, and do what you will: but sin not by proud speech.  <span class="verse" rel="v04332  013" id="32  013" >13</span>
 And for these things bless him that made you, and has replenished you with his good things.  <span class="verse" rel="v04332  014" id="32  014" >14</span>
 Whoso fears the Lord will receive his discipline; and they that seek him early shall find favor.  <span class="verse" rel="v04332  015" id="32  015" >15</span>
 He that seeks the law shall be filled therewith: but the hypocrite will be offended thereat.  <span class="verse" rel="v04332  016" id="32  016" >16</span>
 They that fear the Lord shall find judgment, and shall kindle justice as a light.  <span class="verse" rel="v04332  017" id="32  017" >17</span>
 A sinful man will not be reproved, but finds an excuse according to his will.  <span class="verse" rel="v04332  018" id="32  018" >18</span>
 A man of counsel will be considerate; but a strange and proud man is not daunted with fear, even when of himself he has done without counsel.  <span class="verse" rel="v04332  019" id="32  019" >19</span>
 Do nothing without advice; and when you have once done, repent not.  <span class="verse" rel="v04332  020" id="32  020" >20</span>
 Go not in a way wherein you may fall, and stumble not among the stones.  <span class="verse" rel="v04332  021" id="32  021" >21</span>
 Be not confident in a plain way.  <span class="verse" rel="v04332  022" id="32  022" >22</span>
 And beware of your own children.  <span class="verse" rel="v04332  023" id="32  023" >23</span>
 In every good work trust your own soul; for this is the keeping of the commandments.  <span class="verse" rel="v04332  024" id="32  024" >24</span>
 He that believes in the Lord takes heed to the commandment; and he that trusts in him shall fare never the worse.

 A wise man hates not the law; but he that is an hypocrite therein is as a ship in a storm.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  003" id="33  003" >3</span>
 A man of understanding trusts in the law; and the law is faithful to him, as an oracle.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  004" id="33  004" >4</span>

 The heart of the foolish is like a cartwheel; and his thoughts are like a rolling axle tree.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  006" id="33  006" >6</span>
 A stallion horse is as a mocking friend, he neighs under every one that sits upon him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  007" id="33  007" >7</span>
 Why does one day excel another, when as all the light of every day in the year is of the sun?  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  008" id="33  008" >8</span>
 By the knowledge of the Lord they were distinguished: and he altered seasons and feasts.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  009" id="33  009" >9</span>
 Some of them has he made high days, and hallowed them, and some of them has he made ordinary days.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  010" id="33  010" >10</span>
 And all men are from the ground, and Adam was created of earth:  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  011" id="33  011" >11</span>
 In much knowledge the Lord has divided them, and made their ways diverse.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  012" id="33  012" >12</span>
 Some of them has he blessed and exalted and some of them he sanctified, and set near himself: but some of them has he cursed and brought low, and turned out of their places.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  013" id="33  013" >13</span>
 As the clay is in the potter's hand, to fashion it at his pleasure: so man is in the hand of him that made him, to render to them as likes him best.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  014" id="33  014" >14</span>
 Good is set against evil, and life against death: so is the godly against the sinner, and the sinner against the godly.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  015" id="33  015" >15</span>
 So look upon all the works of the most High; and there are two and two, one against another.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  016" id="33  016" >16</span>
 I awaked up last of all, as one that gathers after the grape gatherers: by the blessing of the Lord I profited, and filled my winepress like a gatherer of grapes.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  017" id="33  017" >17</span>
 Consider that I laboured not for myself only, but for all them that seek learning.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  018" id="33  018" >18</span>
 Hear me, O you° great men of the people, and listen with your ears, you° rulers of the congregation.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  019" id="33  019" >19</span>
 Give not your son and wife, your brother and friend, power over you while you live, and give not your goods to another: lest it repent you, and you entreat for the same again.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  020" id="33  020" >20</span>
 As long as you live and have breath in you, give not yourself over to any.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  021" id="33  021" >21</span>
 For better it is that your children should seek to you, than that you should stand to their courtesy.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  022" id="33  022" >22</span>
 In all your works keep to yourself the preeminence; leave not a stain in your honor.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  023" id="33  023" >23</span>
 At the time when you shall end your days, and finish your life, distribute your inheritance.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  024" id="33  024" >24</span>
 Fodder, a wand, and burdens, are for the ass; and bread, correction, and work, for a servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  025" id="33  025" >25</span>
 If you set your servant to labor, you shall find rest: but if you let him go idle, he shall seek liberty.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  026" id="33  026" >26</span>
 A yoke and a collar do bow the neck: so are tortures and torments for an evil servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  027" id="33  027" >27</span>
 Send him to labor, that he be not idle; for idleness teaches much evil.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  028" id="33  028" >28</span>
 Set him to work, as is fit for him: if he be not obedient, put on more heavy fetters.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  029" id="33  029" >29</span>
 But be not excessive toward any; and without discretion do nothing.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  030" id="33  030" >30</span>
 If you have a servant, let him be to you as yourself, because you have bought him with a price.  <span class="verse" rel="v04333  031" id="33  031" >31</span>
 If you have a servant, entreat him as a brother: for you have need of him, as of your own soul: if you entreat him evil, and he run from you, which way will you go to seek him?

<p><span class="chapter" id="34  001">34  </span> The hopes of a man void of understanding are vain and false: and dreams lift up fools.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  002" id="34  002" >2</span>
 Whoso regards dreams is like him that catches at a shadow, and follows after the wind.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  003" id="34  003" >3</span>
 The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another, even as the likeness of a face to a face.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  004" id="34  004" >4</span>
 Of an unclean thing what can be cleansed? and from that thing which is false what truth can come?  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  005" id="34  005" >5</span>
 Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain: and the heart fancies, as a woman's heart in travail.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  006" id="34  006" >6</span>
 If they be not sent from the most High in your visitation, set not your heart upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  007" id="34  007" >7</span>
 For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put their trust in them.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  008" id="34  008" >8</span>
 The law shall be found perfect without lies: and wisdom is perfection to a faithful mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  009" id="34  009" >9</span>
 A man that has travelled knows many things; and he that has much experience will declare wisdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  010" id="34  010" >10</span>
 He that has no experience knows little: but he that has travelled is full of prudence.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  011" id="34  011" >11</span>
 When I travelled, I saw many things; and I understand more than I can express.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  012" id="34  012" >12</span>
 I was ofttimes in danger of death: yet I was delivered because of these things.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  013" id="34  013" >13</span>
 The spirit of those that fear the Lord shall live; for their hope is in him that saves them.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  014" id="34  014" >14</span>
 Whoso fears the Lord shall not fear nor be afraid; for he is his hope.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  015" id="34  015" >15</span>
 Blessed is the soul of him that fears the Lord: to whom does he look? and who is his strength?  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  016" id="34  016" >16</span>
 For the eyes of the Lord are upon them that love him, he is their mighty protection and strong stay, a defence from heat, and a cover from the sun at noon, a preservation from stumbling, and an help from falling.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  017" id="34  017" >17</span>
 He raises up the soul, and lightens the eyes: he gives health, life, and blessing.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  018" id="34  018" >18</span>
 He that sacrifices of a thing wrongfully gotten, his offering is ridiculous; and the gifts of unjust men are not accepted.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  019" id="34  019" >19</span>
 The most High is not pleased with the offerings of the wicked; neither is he pacified for sin by the multitude of sacrifices.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  020" id="34  020" >20</span>
 Whoso brings an offering of the goods of the poor does as one that kills the son before his father's eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  021" id="34  021" >21</span>
 The bread of the needy is their life: he that defrauds him thereof is a man of blood.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  022" id="34  022" >22</span>
 He that takes away his neighbor's living slays him; and he that defrauds the labourer of his hire is a bloodshedder.  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  023" id="34  023" >23</span>
 When one builds, and another pulls down, what profit have they then but labor?  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  024" id="34  024" >24</span>
 When one prays, and another curses, whose voice will the Lord hear?  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  025" id="34  025" >25</span>
 He that washes himself after the touching of a dead body, if he touch it again, what avails his washing?  <span class="verse" rel="v04334  026" id="34  026" >26</span>
 So is it with a man that fasts for his sins, and goes again, and does the same: who will hear his prayer? or what does his humbling profit him?

<p><span class="chapter" id="35  001">35  </span> He that keeps the law brings offerings enough: he that takes heed to the commandment offers a peace offering.  <span class="verse" rel="v04335  002" id="35  002" >2</span>
 He that requites a good turn offers fine flour; and he that gives alms sacrifices praise.  <span class="verse" rel="v04335  003" id="35  003" >3</span>
 To depart from wickedness is a thing pleasing to the Lord; and to forsake unrighteousness is a propitiation.  <span class="verse" rel="v04335  004" id="35  004" >4</span>
 You shall not appear empty before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v04335  005" id="35  005" >5</span>
 For all these things   are to be done   because of the commandment.  <span class="verse" rel="v04335  006" id="35  006" >6</span>
 The offering of the righteous makes the altar fat, and the sweet savor thereof is before the most High.  <span class="verse" rel="v04335  007" id="35  007" >7</span>
 The sacrifice of a just man is acceptable. and the memorial thereof shall never be forgotten.  <span class="verse" rel="v04335  008" id="35  008" >8</span>
 Give the Lord his honor with a good eye, and diminish not the first fruits of your hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v04335  009" id="35  009" >9</span>
 In all your gifts show a cheerful countenance, and dedicate your tithes with gladness.  <span class="verse" rel="v04335  010" id="35  010" >10</span>
 Give to the most High according as he has enriched you; and as you have gotten, give with a cheerful eye.  <span class="verse" rel="v04335  011" id="35  011" >11</span>
 For the Lord recompenses, and will give you seven times as much.  <span class="verse" rel="v04335  012" id="35  012" >12</span>
 Do not think to corrupt with gifts; for such he will not receive: and trust not to unrighteous sacrifices; for the Lord is judge, and with him is no respect of persons.  <span class="verse" rel="v04335  013" id="35  013" >13</span>
 He will not accept any person against a poor man, but will hear the prayer of the oppressed.  <span class="verse" rel="v04335  014" id="35  014" >14</span>
 He will not despise the supplication of the fatherless; nor the widow, when she pours out her complaint.  <span class="verse" rel="v04335  015" id="35  015" >15</span>
 Do not the tears run down the widow's cheeks? and is not her cry against him that causes them to fall?  <span class="verse" rel="v04335  016" id="35  016" >16</span>
 He that serves the Lord shall be accepted with favor, and his prayer shall reach to the clouds.  <span class="verse" rel="v04335  017" id="35  017" >17</span>
 The prayer of the humble pierces the clouds: and till it come near, he will not be comforted; and will not depart, till the most High shall behold to judge righteously, and execute judgment.  <span class="verse" rel="v04335  018" id="35  018" >18</span>
 For the Lord will not be slack, neither will the Mighty be patient toward them, till he have struck in sunder the loins of the unmerciful, and repayed vengeance to the heathen; till he have taken away the multitude of the proud, and broken the sceptre of the unrighteous;  <span class="verse" rel="v04335  019" id="35  019" >19</span>
 Till he have rendered to every man according to his deeds, and to the works of men according to their devices; till he have judged the cause of his people, and made them to rejoice in his mercy.  <span class="verse" rel="v04335  020" id="35  020" >20</span>
 Mercy is seasonable in the time of affliction, as clouds of rain in the time of drought.

 Neither consult with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous; neither with a coward in matters of war; nor with a merchant concerning exchange; nor with a buyer of selling; nor with an envious man of thankfulness; nor with an unmerciful man touching kindness; nor with the slothful for any work; nor with an hireling for a year of finishing work; nor with an idle servant of much business: listen not to these in any matter of counsel.  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  012" id="37  012" >12</span>
 But be continually with a godly man, whom you know to keep the commandments of the Lord, whose, mind is according to your mind, and will sorrow with you, if you shall miscarry.  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  013" id="37  013" >13</span>
 And let the counsel of your own heart stand: for there is no man more faithful to you than it.  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  014" id="37  014" >14</span>
 For a man's mind is sometime wont to tell him more than seven watchmen, that sit above in an high tower.  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  015" id="37  015" >15</span>
 And above all this pray to the most High, that he will direct your way in truth.  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  016" id="37  016" >16</span>
 Let reason go before every enterprise, and counsel before every action.  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  017" id="37  017" >17</span>
 The countenance is a sign of changing of the heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  018" id="37  018" >18</span>
 Four manner of things appear: good and evil, life and death: but the tongue rules over them continually.  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  019" id="37  019" >19</span>
 There is one that is wise and teaches many, and yet is unprofitable to himself.  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  020" id="37  020" >20</span>
 There is one that shows wisdom in words, and is hated: he shall be destitute of all food.  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  021" id="37  021" >21</span>
 For grace is not given, him from the Lord, because he is deprived of all wisdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  022" id="37  022" >22</span>
 Another is wise to himself; and the fruits of understanding are commendable in his mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  023" id="37  023" >23</span>
 A wise man instructs his people; and the fruits of his understanding fail not.  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  024" id="37  024" >24</span>
 A wise man shall be filled with blessing; and all they that see him shall count him happy.  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  025" id="37  025" >25</span>
 The days of the life of man may be numbered: but the days of Israel are innumerable.  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  026" id="37  026" >26</span>
 A wise man shall inherit glory among his people, and his name shall be perpetual.  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  027" id="37  027" >27</span>
 My son, prove your soul in your life, and see what is evil for it, and give not that to it.  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  028" id="37  028" >28</span>
 For all things are not profitable for all men, neither has every soul pleasure in every thing.  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  029" id="37  029" >29</span>
 Be not unsatiable in any dainty thing, nor too greedy upon meats:  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  030" id="37  030" >30</span>
 For excess of meats brings sickness, and surfeiting will turn into choler.  <span class="verse" rel="v04337  031" id="37  031" >31</span>
 By surfeiting have many perished; but he that takes heed prolongs his life.

<p><span class="chapter" id="38  001">38  </span> Honor a physician with the honor due to him for the uses which you° may have of him: for the Lord has created him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  002" id="38  002" >2</span>
 For of the most High comes healing, and he shall receive honor of the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  003" id="38  003" >3</span>
 The skill of the physician shall lift up his head: and in the sight of great men he shall be in admiration.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  004" id="38  004" >4</span>
 The Lord has created medicines out of the earth; and he that is wise will not abhor them.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  005" id="38  005" >5</span>
 Was not the water made sweet with wood, that the virtue thereof might be known?  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  006" id="38  006" >6</span>
 And he has given men skill, that he might be honored in his marvelous works.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  007" id="38  007" >7</span>
 With such does he heal   men,   and takes away their pains.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  008" id="38  008" >8</span>
 Of such does the apothecary make a confection; and of his works there is no end; and from him is peace over all the earth,  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  009" id="38  009" >9</span>
 My son, in your sickness be not negligent: but pray to the Lord, and he will make you whole.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  010" id="38  010" >10</span>
 Leave off from sin, and order your hands aright, and cleanse your heart from all wickedness.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  011" id="38  011" >11</span>
 Give a sweet savor, and a memorial of fine flour; and make a fat offering, as not being.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  012" id="38  012" >12</span>
 Then give place to the physician, for the Lord has created him: let him not go from you, for you have need of him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  013" id="38  013" >13</span>
 There is a time when in their hands there is good success.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  014" id="38  014" >14</span>
 For they shall also pray to the Lord, that he would prosper that, which they give for ease and remedy to prolong life.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  015" id="38  015" >15</span>
 He that sins before his Maker, let him fall into the hand of the physician.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  016" id="38  016" >16</span>
 My son, let tears fall down over the dead, and begin to lament, as if you had suffered great harm yourself; and then cover his body according to the custom, and neglect not his burial.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  017" id="38  017" >17</span>
 Weep bitterly, and make great moan, and use lamentation, as he is worthy, and that a day or two, lest you be evil spoken of: and then comfort yourself for your heaviness.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  018" id="38  018" >18</span>
 For of heaviness comes death, and the heaviness of the heart breaks strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  019" id="38  019" >19</span>
 In affliction also sorrow remains: and the life of the poor is the curse of the heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  020" id="38  020" >20</span>
 Take no heaviness to heart: drive it away, and member the last end.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  021" id="38  021" >21</span>
 Forget it not, for there is no turning again: you shall not do him good, but hurt yourself.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  022" id="38  022" >22</span>
 Remember my judgment: for your also shall be so; yesterday for me, and to day for you.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  023" id="38  023" >23</span>
 When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest; and be comforted for him, when his Spirit is departed from him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  024" id="38  024" >24</span>
 The wisdom of a learned man comes by opportunity of leisure: and he that has little business shall become wise.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  025" id="38  025" >25</span>
 How can he get wisdom that holds the plow, and that glories in the goad, that drives oxen, and is occupied in their labors, and whose talk is of bullocks?  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  026" id="38  026" >26</span>
 He gives his mind to make furrows; and is diligent to give the kine fodder.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  027" id="38  027" >27</span>
 So every carpenter and workmaster, that labores night and day: and they that cut and grave seals, and are diligent to make great variety, and give themselves to counterfeit imagery, and watch to finish a work:  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  028" id="38  028" >28</span>
 The smith also sitting by the anvil, and considering the iron work, the vapor of the fire wastes his flesh, and he fights with the heat of the furnace: the noise of the hammer and the anvil is ever in his ears, and his eyes look still upon the pattern of the thing that he makes; he sets his mind to finish his work, and watches to polish it perfectly:  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  029" id="38  029" >29</span>
 So does the potter sitting at his work, and turning the wheel about with his feet, who is always carefully set at his work, and makes all his work by number;  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  030" id="38  030" >30</span>
 He fashions the clay with his arm, and bows down his strength before his feet; he applies himself to lead it over; and he is diligent to make clean the furnace:  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  031" id="38  031" >31</span>
 All these trust to their hands: and every one is wise in his work.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  032" id="38  032" >32</span>
 Without these can’t a city be inhabited: and they shall not dwell where they will, nor go up and down:  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  033" id="38  033" >33</span>
 They shall not be sought for in publick counsel, nor sit high in the congregation: they shall not sit on the judges' seat, nor understand the sentence of judgment: they can’t declare justice and judgment; and they shall not be found where parables are spoken.  <span class="verse" rel="v04338  034" id="38  034" >34</span>
 But they will maintain the state of the world, and   all   their desire is in the work of their craft.

<p><span class="chapter" id="39  001">39  </span> But he that gives his mind to the law of the most High, and is occupied in the meditation thereof, will seek out the wisdom of all the ancient, and be occupied in prophecies.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  002" id="39  002" >2</span>
 He will keep the sayings of the renowned men: and where subtle parables are, he will be there also.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  003" id="39  003" >3</span>
 He will seek out the secrets of grave sentences, and be conversant in dark parables.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  004" id="39  004" >4</span>
 He shall serve among great men, and appear before princes: he will travel through strange countries; for he has tried the good and the evil among men.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  005" id="39  005" >5</span>
 He will give his heart to resort early to the Lord that made him, and will pray before the most High, and will open his mouth in prayer, and make supplication for his sins.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  006" id="39  006" >6</span>

 Many shall commend his understanding; and so long as the world endures, it shall not be blotted out; his memorial shall not depart away, and his name shall live from generation to generation.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  010" id="39  010" >10</span>
 Nations shall show forth his wisdom, and the congregation shall declare his praise.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  011" id="39  011" >11</span>
 If he die, he shall leave a greater name than a thousand: and if he live, he shall increase it.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  012" id="39  012" >12</span>
 Yet have I more to say, which I have thought upon; for I am filled as the moon at the full.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  013" id="39  013" >13</span>
 Listen to me, you° holy children, and bud forth as a rose growing by the brook of the field:  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  014" id="39  014" >14</span>
 And give you° a sweet savor as frankincense, and flourish as a lily, send forth a smell, and sing a song of praise, bless the Lord in all his works.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  015" id="39  015" >15</span>
 Magnify his name, and show forth his praise with the songs of your lips, and with harps, and in praising him you° shall say after this manner:  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  016" id="39  016" >16</span>
 All the works of the Lord are exceeding good, and whatever he commands shall be accomplished in due season.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  017" id="39  017" >17</span>
 And none may say, What is this? therefore is that? for at time convenient they shall all be sought out: at his commandment the waters stood as an heap, and at the words of his mouth the receptacles of waters.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  018" id="39  018" >18</span>
 At his commandment is done whatever pleases him; and none can hinder, when he will save.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  019" id="39  019" >19</span>
 The works of all flesh are before him, and nothing can be hid from his eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  020" id="39  020" >20</span>
 He sees from everlasting to everlasting; and there is nothing wonderful before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  021" id="39  021" >21</span>
 A man need not to say, What is this? therefore is that? for he has made all things for their uses.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  022" id="39  022" >22</span>
 His blessing covered the dry land as a river, and watered it as a flood.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  023" id="39  023" >23</span>

 For the good are good things created from the beginning: so evil things for sinners.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  026" id="39  026" >26</span>
 The principal things for the whole use of man's life are water, fire, iron, and salt, flour of wheat, honey, milk, and the blood of the grape, and oil, and clothing.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  027" id="39  027" >27</span>
 All these things are for good to the godly: so to the sinners they are turned into evil.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  028" id="39  028" >28</span>
 There be spirits that are created for vengeance, which in their fury lay on sore strokes; in the time of destruction they pour out their force, and appease the wrath of him that made them.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  029" id="39  029" >29</span>
 Fire, and hail, and famine, and death, all these were created for vengeance;  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  030" id="39  030" >30</span>
 Teeth of wild beasts, and scorpions, serpents, and the sword punishing the wicked to destruction.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  031" id="39  031" >31</span>
 They shall rejoice in his commandment, and they shall be ready upon earth, when need is; and when their time is come, they shall not transgress his word.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  032" id="39  032" >32</span>
 Therefore from the beginning I was resolved, and thought upon these things, and have left them in writing.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  033" id="39  033" >33</span>
 All the works of the Lord are good: and he will give every needful thing in due season.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  034" id="39  034" >34</span>
 So that a man can’t say, This is worse than that: for in time they shall all be well approved.  <span class="verse" rel="v04339  035" id="39  035" >35</span>

 The inheritance of sinners' children shall perish, and their posterity shall have a perpetual reproach.  <span class="verse" rel="v04341  007" id="41  007" >7</span>
 The children will complain of an ungodly father, because they shall be reproached for his sake.  <span class="verse" rel="v04341  008" id="41  008" >8</span>
 Woe be to you, ungodly men, which have forsaken the law of the most high God! for if you° increase, it shall be to your destruction:  <span class="verse" rel="v04341  009" id="41  009" >9</span>
 And if you° be born, you° shall be born to a curse: and if you° die, a curse shall be your portion.  <span class="verse" rel="v04341  010" id="41  010" >10</span>
 All that are of the earth shall turn to earth again: so the ungodly shall go from a curse to destruction.  <span class="verse" rel="v04341  011" id="41  011" >11</span>
 The mourning of men is about their bodies: but an ill name of sinners shall be blotted out.  <span class="verse" rel="v04341  012" id="41  012" >12</span>
 Have regard to your name; for that shall continue with you above a thousand great treasures of gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v04341  013" id="41  013" >13</span>
 A good life has but few days: but a good name endures for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v04341  014" id="41  014" >14</span>
 My children, keep discipline in peace: for wisdom that is hid, and a treasure that is not seen, what profit is in them both?  <span class="verse" rel="v04341  015" id="41  015" >15</span>
 A man that hides his foolishness is better than a man that hides his wisdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v04341  016" id="41  016" >16</span>
 Therefore be shamefaced according to my word: for it is not good to retain all shamefacedness; neither is it altogether approved in every thing.  <span class="verse" rel="v04341  017" id="41  017" >17</span>
 Be ashamed of whoredom before father and mother: and of a lie before a prince and a mighty man;  <span class="verse" rel="v04341  018" id="41  018" >18</span>
 Of an offense before a judge and ruler; of iniquity before a congregation and people; of unjust dealing before your partner and friend;  <span class="verse" rel="v04341  019" id="41  019" >19</span>
 And of theft in regard of the place where you sojourn, and in regard of the truth of God and his covenant; and to lean with your elbow upon the meat; and of scorning to give and take;  <span class="verse" rel="v04341  020" id="41  020" >20</span>
 And of silence before them that salute you; and to look upon an harlot;  <span class="verse" rel="v04341  021" id="41  021" >21</span>
 And to turn away your face from your kinsman; or to take away a portion or a gift; or to gaze upon another man's wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v04341  022" id="41  022" >22</span>
 Or to be overbusy with his maid, and come not near her bed; or of upbraiding speeches before friends; and after you have given, upbraid not;

<p><span class="chapter" id="42  001">42  </span> Or of iterating and speaking again that which you have heard; and of revealing of secrets. So shall you be truly shamefaced and find favor before all men. Of these things be not you ashamed, and accept no person to sin thereby:  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  002" id="42  002" >2</span>
 Of the law of the most High, and his covenant; and of judgment to justify the ungodly;  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  003" id="42  003" >3</span>
 Of reckoning with your partners and travellers; or of the gift of the heritage of friends;  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  004" id="42  004" >4</span>
 Of exactness of balance and weights; or of getting much or little;  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  005" id="42  005" >5</span>
 And of merchants' indifferent selling; of much correction of children; and to make the side of an evil servant to bleed.  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  006" id="42  006" >6</span>
 Sure keeping is good, where an evil wife is; and shut up, where many hands are.  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  007" id="42  007" >7</span>
 Deliver all things in number and weight; and put all in writing that you give out, or receive in.  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  008" id="42  008" >8</span>
 Be not ashamed to inform the unwise and foolish, and the extreme aged that contends with those that are young: thus shall you be truly learned, and approved of all men living.  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  009" id="42  009" >9</span>
 A daughter is a wakeful care to a father; and the care for her takes away sleep: when she is young, lest she pass away the flower of her age; and being married, lest she should be hated:  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  010" id="42  010" >10</span>
 In her virginity, lest she should be defiled and gotten with child in her father's house; and having an husband, lest she should misbehave herself; and when she is married, lest she should be barren.  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  011" id="42  011" >11</span>
 Keep a sure watch over a shameless daughter, lest she make you a laughing stock to your enemies, and a byword in the city, and a reproach among the people, and make you ashamed before the multitude.  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  012" id="42  012" >12</span>
 Behold not every body's beauty, and sit not in the midst of women.  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  013" id="42  013" >13</span>
 For from garments comes a moth, and from women wickedness.  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  014" id="42  014" >14</span>
 Better is the churlishness of a man than a courteous woman, a woman, I say, which brings shame and reproach.  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  015" id="42  015" >15</span>
 I will now remember the works of the Lord, and declare the things that I have seen: In the words of the Lord are his works.  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  016" id="42  016" >16</span>
 The sun that gives light looks upon all things, and the work thereof is full of the glory of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  017" id="42  017" >17</span>
 The Lord has not given power to the saints to declare all his marvelous works, which the Almighty Lord firmly settled, that whatever is might be established for his glory.  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  018" id="42  018" >18</span>
 He seeks out the deep, and the heart, and considers their crafty devices: for the Lord knows all that may be known, and he sees the signs of the world.  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  019" id="42  019" >19</span>
 He declares the things that are past, and for to come, and reveals the steps of hidden things.  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  020" id="42  020" >20</span>
 No thought escapes him, neither any word is hidden from him.  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  021" id="42  021" >21</span>
 He has garnished the excellent works of his wisdom, and he is from everlasting to everlasting: to him may nothing be added, neither can he be diminished, and he has no need of any counsellor.  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  022" id="42  022" >22</span>
 Oh how desirable are all his works! and that a man may see even to a spark.  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  023" id="42  023" >23</span>
 All these things live and remain for ever for all uses, and they are all obedient.  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  024" id="42  024" >24</span>
 All things are double one against another: and he has made nothing imperfect.  <span class="verse" rel="v04342  025" id="42  025" >25</span>

 The sun when it appears, declaring at his rising a marvelous instrument, the work of the most High:  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  003" id="43  003" >3</span>
 At noon it parches the country, and who can abide the burning heat thereof?  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  004" id="43  004" >4</span>
 A man blowing a furnace is in works of heat, but the sun burns the mountains three times more; breathing out fiery vapours, and sending forth bright beams, it dims the eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  005" id="43  005" >5</span>
 Great is the Lord that made it; and at his commandment runs hastily.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  006" id="43  006" >6</span>
 He made the moon also to serve in her season for a declaration of times, and a sign of the world.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  007" id="43  007" >7</span>
 From the moon is the sign of feasts, a light that decreases in her perfection.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  008" id="43  008" >8</span>
 The month is called after her name, increasing wonderfully in her changing, being an instrument of the armies above, shining in the firmament of heaven;  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  009" id="43  009" >9</span>
 The beauty of heaven, the glory of the stars, an ornament giving light in the highest places of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  010" id="43  010" >10</span>
 At the commandment of the Holy One they will stand in their order, and never faint in their watches.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  011" id="43  011" >11</span>
 Look upon the rainbow, and praise him that made it; very beautiful it is in the brightness thereof.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  012" id="43  012" >12</span>
 It encircles the heaven about with a glorious circle, and the hands of the most High have bended it.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  013" id="43  013" >13</span>
 By his commandment he makes the snow to fall apace, and sends swiftly the lightnings of his judgment.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  014" id="43  014" >14</span>
 Through this the treasures are opened: and clouds fly forth as fowls.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  015" id="43  015" >15</span>
 By his great power he makes the clouds firm, and the hailstones are broken small.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  016" id="43  016" >16</span>
 At his sight the mountains are shaken, and at his will the south wind blows.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  017" id="43  017" >17</span>
 The noise of the thunder makes the earth to tremble: so does the northern storm and the whirlwind: as birds flying he scatters the snow, and the falling down thereof is as the lighting of grasshoppers:  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  018" id="43  018" >18</span>
 The eye marvels at the beauty of the whiteness thereof, and the heart is astonished at the raining of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  019" id="43  019" >19</span>
 The hoarfrost also as salt he pours on the earth, and being congealed, it lies on the top of sharp stakes.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  020" id="43  020" >20</span>
 When the cold north wind blows, and the water is congealed into ice, it remains upon every gathering together of water, and clothes the water as with a breastplate.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  021" id="43  021" >21</span>
 It devours the mountains, and burns the wilderness, and consumes the grass as fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  022" id="43  022" >22</span>
 A present remedy of all is a mist coming speedily, a dew coming after heat refreshes.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  023" id="43  023" >23</span>
 By his counsel he appeases the deep, and plants islands therein.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  024" id="43  024" >24</span>
 They that sail on the sea tell of the danger thereof; and when we hear it with our ears, we marvel thereat.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  025" id="43  025" >25</span>

 We may speak much, and yet come short: therefore in sum, he is all.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  028" id="43  028" >28</span>
 How shall we be able to magnify him? for he is great above all his works.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  029" id="43  029" >29</span>
 The Lord is terrible and very great, and marvelous is his power.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  030" id="43  030" >30</span>
 When you° glorify the Lord, exalt him as much as you° can; for even yet will he far exceed: and when you° exalt him, put forth all your strength, and be not weary; for you° can never go far enough.  <span class="verse" rel="v04343  031" id="43  031" >31</span>

 Such as did bear rule in their kingdoms, men renowned for their power, giving counsel by their understanding, and declaring prophecies:  <span class="verse" rel="v04344  004" id="44  004" >4</span>
 Leaders of the people by their counsels, and by their knowledge of learning meet for the people, wise and eloquent are their instructions:  <span class="verse" rel="v04344  005" id="44  005" >5</span>
 Such as found out musical tunes, and recited verses in writing:  <span class="verse" rel="v04344  006" id="44  006" >6</span>
 Rich men furnished with ability, living peaceably in their habitations:  <span class="verse" rel="v04344  007" id="44  007" >7</span>
 All these were honored in their generations, and were the glory of their times.  <span class="verse" rel="v04344  008" id="44  008" >8</span>
 There be of them, that have left a name behind them, that their praises might be reported.  <span class="verse" rel="v04344  009" id="44  009" >9</span>
 And some there be, which have no memorial; who are perished, as though they had never been; and are become as though they had never been born; and their children after them.  <span class="verse" rel="v04344  010" id="44  010" >10</span>
 But these were merciful men, whose righteousness has not been forgotten.  <span class="verse" rel="v04344  011" id="44  011" >11</span>
 With their seed shall continually remain a good inheritance, and their children are within the covenant.  <span class="verse" rel="v04344  012" id="44  012" >12</span>

 Enoch pleased the Lord, and was translated, being an example of repentance to all generations.  <span class="verse" rel="v04344  017" id="44  017" >17</span>
 Noah was found perfect and righteous; in the time of wrath he was taken in exchange   for the world;   therefore was he left as a remnant to the earth, when the flood came.  <span class="verse" rel="v04344  018" id="44  018" >18</span>
 An everlasting covenant was made with him, that all flesh should perish no more by the flood.  <span class="verse" rel="v04344  019" id="44  019" >19</span>
 Abraham was a great father of many people: in glory was there none like to him;  <span class="verse" rel="v04344  020" id="44  020" >20</span>

 Therefore he assured him by an oath, that he would bless the nations in his seed, and that he would multiply him as the dust of the earth, and exalt his seed as the stars, and cause them to inherit from sea to sea, and from the river to the utmost part of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v04344  022" id="44  022" >22</span>

 By his words he caused the wonders to cease, and he made him glorious in the sight of kings, and gave him a commandment for his people, and showed him part of his glory.  <span class="verse" rel="v04345  004" id="45  004" >4</span>
 He sanctified him in his faithfulness and meekness, and chose him out of all men.  <span class="verse" rel="v04345  005" id="45  005" >5</span>
 He made him to hear his voice, and brought him into the dark cloud, and gave him commandments before his face, even the law of life and knowledge, that he might teach Jacob his covenants, and Israel his judgments.  <span class="verse" rel="v04345  006" id="45  006" >6</span>
 He exalted Aaron, an holy man like to him, even his brother, of the tribe of Levi.  <span class="verse" rel="v04345  007" id="45  007" >7</span>
 An everlasting covenant he made with him and gave him the priesthood among the people; he beautified him with comely ornaments, and clothed him with a robe of glory.  <span class="verse" rel="v04345  008" id="45  008" >8</span>
 He put upon him perfect glory; and strengthened him with rich garments, with breeches, with a long robe, and the ephod.  <span class="verse" rel="v04345  009" id="45  009" >9</span>
 And he compassed him with pomegranates, and with many golden bells round about, that as he went there might be a sound, and a noise made that might be heard in the temple, for a memorial to the children of his people;  <span class="verse" rel="v04345  010" id="45  010" >10</span>

 Moses consecrated him, and anointed him with holy oil: this was appointed to him by an everlasting covenant, and to his seed, so long as the heavens should remain, that they should minister to him, and execute the office of the priesthood, and bless the people in his name.  <span class="verse" rel="v04345  016" id="45  016" >16</span>

 Howbeit in the land of the people he had no inheritance, neither had he any portion among the people: for the Lord himself is his portion and inheritance.  <span class="verse" rel="v04345  023" id="45  023" >23</span>
 The third in glory is Phinees the son of Eleazar, because he had zeal in the fear of the Lord, and stood up with good courage of heart: when the people were turned back, and made reconciliation for Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v04345  024" id="45  024" >24</span>

 By an accusation to the king from an unrighteous tongue my soul drew near even to death, my life was near to the hell beneath.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  007" id="51  007" >7</span>
 They compassed me on every side, and there was no man to help me: I looked for the succour of men, but there was none.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  008" id="51  008" >8</span>
 Then thought I upon your mercy, O Lord, and upon your acts of old, how you deliver such as wait for you, and save them out of the hands of the enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  009" id="51  009" >9</span>
 Then lifted I up my supplications from the earth, and prayed for deliverance from death.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  010" id="51  010" >10</span>
 I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord, that he would not leave me in the days of my trouble, and in the time of the proud, when there was no help.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  011" id="51  011" >11</span>
 I will praise your name continually, and will sing praises with thanksgiving; and so my prayer was heard:  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  012" id="51  012" >12</span>
 For you saved me from destruction, and delivered me from the evil time: therefore will I give thanks, and praise you, and bless they name, O Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  013" id="51  013" >13</span>
 When I was yet young, or ever I went abroad, I desired wisdom openly in my prayer.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  014" id="51  014" >14</span>
 I prayed for her before the temple, and will seek her out even to the end.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  015" id="51  015" >15</span>
 Even from the flower till the grape was ripe has my heart delighted in her: my foot went the right way, from my youth up sought I after her.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  016" id="51  016" >16</span>
 I bowed down my ear a little, and received her, and got much learning.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  017" id="51  017" >17</span>
 I profited therein, therefore will I ascribe glory to him that gives me wisdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  018" id="51  018" >18</span>
 For I purposed to do after her, and earnestly I followed that which is good; so shall I not be confounded.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  019" id="51  019" >19</span>
 My soul has wrestled with her, and in my doings I was exact: I stretched forth my hands to the heaven above, and bewailed my ignorances of her.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  020" id="51  020" >20</span>
 I directed my soul to her, and I found her in pureness: I have had my heart joined with her from the beginning, therefore shall I not be forsaken.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  021" id="51  021" >21</span>
 My heart was troubled in seeking her: therefore have I gotten a good possession.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  022" id="51  022" >22</span>
 The Lord has given me a tongue for my reward, and I will praise him therewith.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  023" id="51  023" >23</span>
 Draw near to me, you° unlearned, and dwell in the house of learning.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  024" id="51  024" >24</span>
 Therefore are you° slow, and what say you° to these things, seeing your souls are very thirsty?  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  025" id="51  025" >25</span>
 I opened my mouth, and said, Buy her for yourselves without money.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  026" id="51  026" >26</span>
 Put your neck under the yoke, and let your soul receive instruction: she is hard at hand to find.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  027" id="51  027" >27</span>
 Behold with your eyes, how that I have but little labor, and have gotten to me much rest.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  028" id="51  028" >28</span>
 Get learning with a great sum of money, and get much gold by her.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  029" id="51  029" >29</span>
 Let your soul rejoice in his mercy, and be not ashamed of his praise.  <span class="verse" rel="v04351  030" id="51  030" >30</span>
 Work your work betimes, and in his time he will give you your reward.
