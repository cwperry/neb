<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">T</span>he burden of Nineve: the book of the vision of Naum the Elkesite.  <span class="verse" rel="v0341  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 God is jealous, and the Lord avenges; the Lord avenges with wrath; the Lord takes vengeance on his adversaries, and he cuts off his enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0341  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 The Lord is longsuffering, and his power is great, and the Lord will not hold any guiltless: his way is in destruction and in the whirlwind, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.  <span class="verse" rel="v0341  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 He threatens the sea, and dries it up, and exhausts all the rivers: the land of Basan, and Carmel are brought low, and the flourishing   trees   of Libanus have come to nothing.  <span class="verse" rel="v0341  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 The mountains quake at him, and the hills are shaken, and the earth recoils at his presence,   even   the world, and all that dwell in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0341  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 Who shall stand before his anger? and who shall withstand in the anger of his wrath? his wrath brings to nothing kingdoms, and the rocks are burst asunder by him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0341  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 The Lord is good to them that wait on him in the day of affliction; and he knows them that reverence him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0341  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end: darkness shall pursue those that rise up against   him   and his enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0341  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 What do youÂ° devise against the Lord? he will make a complete end: he will not take vengeance by affliction twice at the same time.  <span class="verse" rel="v0341  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 For   the enemy   shall be laid bare even to the foundation, and shall be devoured as twisted yew, and as stubble fully dry.  <span class="verse" rel="v0341  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 Out of you shall proceed a device against the Lord, counselling evil things hostile   to him  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0341  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 Thus says the Lord who rules over many waters, Even thus shall they be sent away, and the report of you shall not be heard any more.  <span class="verse" rel="v0341  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 And now will I break his rod from off you, and will burst   your   bonds.  <span class="verse" rel="v0341  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 And the Lord shall give a command concerning you; there shall no more of your name be scattered: I will utterly destroy the graven   images   out of the house of your god, and the molten   images  : I will make your grave; for   they are   swift.  <span class="verse" rel="v0341  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that brings glad tidings, and publishes peace! O Juda, keep your feasts, pay your vows: for they shall no more pass through you to   your   decay.  
<!-- 2   015 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> It is all over with him, he has been removed,   one   who has been delivered from affliction has come up panting into your presence, watch the way, strengthen   your   loins, be very valiant in   your   strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v0342  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 For the Lord has turned aside the pride of Jacob, as the pride of Israel: for they have utterly rejected them, and have destroyed their branches.  <span class="verse" rel="v0342  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
    They have destroyed   the arms of their power from among men, their mighty men sporting with fire: the reins of their chariots   shall be destroyed   in the day of his preparation, and the horsemen shall be thrown into confusion  <span class="verse" rel="v0342  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 in the ways, and the chariots shall clash together, and shall be entangled in each other in the broad ways: their appearance is as lamps of fire, and as gleaming lightnings.  <span class="verse" rel="v0342  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 And their mighty men shall bethink themselves and flee by day; and they shall be weak as they go; and they shall hasten to her walls, and shall prepare their defences.  <span class="verse" rel="v0342  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 The gates of the cities have been opened, and the palaces have fallen into ruin,  <span class="verse" rel="v0342  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 and the foundation has been exposed; and she has gone up, and her maidservants were led   away   as doves moaning in their hearts.  <span class="verse" rel="v0342  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 And   as for   Nineve, her waters   shall be   as a pool of water: and they fled, and staid not, and there was none to look back.  <span class="verse" rel="v0342  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 They plundered the silver, they plundered the gold, and there was no end of their adorning; they were loaded   with it   upon all their pleasant vessels.  <span class="verse" rel="v0342  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
    There is   thrusting forth, and shaking, and tumult, and heart-breaking, and loosing of knees, and pangs on all loins; and the faces of all   are   as the blackening of a pot.  <span class="verse" rel="v0342  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 Where is the dwelling-place of the lions, and the pasture that belonged to the whelps? where did the lion go, that the lion's whelp should enter in there, and there was none to scare   him   away?  <span class="verse" rel="v0342  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 The lion seized enough prey for his whelps, and strangled for his   young   lions, and filled his lair with prey, and his dwelling-place with spoil.  <span class="verse" rel="v0342  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 Behold, I am against you, says the Lord Almighty, and I will burn up your multitude in the smoke, and the sword shall devour your lions; and I will utterly destroy your prey from off the land, and your deeds shall no more at all be heard of.  
<!-- 3   013 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> O city of blood, wholly false, full of unrighteousness; the prey shall not be handled.  <span class="verse" rel="v0343  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 The noise of whips, and the noise of the rumbling of wheels, and of the pursuing horse, and of the bounding chariot,  <span class="verse" rel="v0343  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 and of the mounting rider, and of the glittering sword, and of the gleaming arms, and of a multitude of slain, and of heavy falling: and there was no end to her nations, but they shall be weak in their bodies  <span class="verse" rel="v0343  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 because of the abundance of fornication:   she is   a fair harlot, and well-favoured, skilled in sorcery, that sells the nations by her fornication, and peoples by her sorceries.  <span class="verse" rel="v0343  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 Behold, I am against you, says the Lord God Almighty, and I will uncover your skirts in your presence, and I will show the nations your shame, and the kingdoms your disgrace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0343  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 And I will cast abominable filth upon you according to your unclean ways, and will make you a public example.  <span class="verse" rel="v0343  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 And it shall be   that   every one that sees you shall go down from you, and shall say, Wretched Nineve! who shall lament for her? whence shall I seek comfort for her?  <span class="verse" rel="v0343  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 Prepare you a portion, tune the chord, prepare a portion for Ammon: she that dwells among the rivers, water is round about her, whose dominion is the sea, and whose walls are water.  <span class="verse" rel="v0343  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 And Ethiopia is her strength, and Egypt; and there was no limit of the flight   of her enemies  ; and the Libyans became her helpers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0343  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 Yet she shall go as a prisoner into captivity, and they shall dash her infants against the ground at the top of all her ways: and they shall cast lots upon all her glorious   possessions  , and all her nobles shall be bound in chains.  <span class="verse" rel="v0343  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 And you shall be drunken, and shall be overlooked; and you shall seek for yourself strength because of   your   enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0343  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 All your strongholds are as fig-trees having watchers: if they be shaken, they shall fall into the mouth of the eater.  <span class="verse" rel="v0343  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 Behold, your people within you are as women: the gates of your land shall surely be opened to your enemies: the fire shall devour your bars.  <span class="verse" rel="v0343  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 Draw you water for a siege, and well secure your strongholds: enter into the clay, and be you trodden in the chaff, make   the fortifications   stronger than brick.  <span class="verse" rel="v0343  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 There the fire shall devour you; the sword shall utterly destroy you, it shall devour you as the locust, and you shall be pressed down as a palmerworm.  <span class="verse" rel="v0343  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 You have multiplied your merchandise beyond the stars of heaven: the palmerworm has attacked   it  , and has flown away.  <span class="verse" rel="v0343  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 Your mixed   multitude   has suddenly departed as the grasshopper, as the locust perched on a hedge in a frosty day; the sun arises, and it flies off, and knows not its place: woe to them!  <span class="verse" rel="v0343  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 Your shepherds have slumbered, the Assyrian king has laid low your mighty men: your people departed to the mountains, and there was none to receive   them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0343  019" id="3  019" >19</span>
 There is no healing for your bruise; your wound has rankled: all that hear the report of you shall clap their hands against you; for upon whom has not your wickedness passed continually?
