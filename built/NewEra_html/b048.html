<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">A</span>nd king Astyages was gathered to his fathers, and Cyrus of Persia received his kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 And Daniel conversed with the king, and was honored above all his friends.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 Now the Babylonians had an idol, called Bel, and there were spent upon him every day twelve great measures of fine flour, and forty sheep, and six vessels of wine.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And the king worshipped it and went daily to adore it: but Daniel worshipped his own God. And the king said to him, Why do not you worship Bel?  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 Who answered and said, Because I may not worship idols made with hands, but the living God, who has created the heaven and the earth, and has sovereignty over all flesh.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 Then said the king to him, Thinkest you not that Bel is a living God? see you not how much he eats and drinks every day?  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 Then Daniel smiled, and said, O king, be not deceived: for this is but clay within, and brass without, and did never eat or drink any thing.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 So the king was angry, and called for his priests, and said to them, If you° tell me not who this is that devours these expenses, you° shall die.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 But if you° can certify me that Bel devours them, then Daniel shall die: for he has spoken blasphemy against Bel. And Daniel said to the king, Let it be according to your word.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 Now the priests of Bel were threescore and ten, beside their wives and children. And the king went with Daniel into the temple of Bel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 So Bel's priests said, Behold, we go out: but you, O king, set on the meat, and make ready the wine, and shut the door fast and seal it with your own signet;  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 And to morrow when you come in, if you find not that Bel has eaten up all, we will suffer death: or else Daniel, that speaks falsely against us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 And they little regarded it: for under the table they had made a privy entrance, whereby they entered in continually, and consumed those things.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 So when they were gone forth, the king set meats before Bel. Now Daniel had commanded his servants to bring ashes, and those they strewed throughout all the temple in the presence of the king alone: then they went out, and shut the door, and sealed it with the king's signet, and so departed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 Now in the night came the priests with their wives and children, as they were wont to do, and did eat and drink up all.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 In the morning betime the king arose, and Daniel with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 And the king said, Daniel, are the seals whole? And he said, Yes, O king, they be whole.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 And as soon as he had opened the dour, the king looked upon the table, and cried with a loud voice, Great are you, O Bel, and with you is no deceit at all.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 Then laughed Daniel, and held the king that he should not go in, and said, Behold now the pavement, and mark well whose footsteps are these.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 And the king said, I see the footsteps of men, women, and children. And then the king was angry,  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  021" id="1  021" >21</span>
 And took the priests with their wives and children, who showed him the privy doors, where they came in, and consumed such things as were upon the table.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  022" id="1  022" >22</span>
 Therefore the king killed them, and delivered Bel into Daniel's power, who destroyed him and his temple.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  023" id="1  023" >23</span>
 And in that same place there was a great dragon, which they of Babylon worshipped.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  024" id="1  024" >24</span>
 And the king said to Daniel, Will you also say that this is of brass? behold, he lives, he eats and drinks; you can not say that he is no living god: therefore worship him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  025" id="1  025" >25</span>
 Then said Daniel to the king, I will worship the Lord my God: for he is the living God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  026" id="1  026" >26</span>
 But give me leave, O king, and I shall kill this dragon without sword or staff. The king said, I give you leave.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  027" id="1  027" >27</span>
 Then Daniel took pitch, and fat, and hair, and did seethe them together, and made lumps thereof: this he put in the dragon's mouth, and so the dragon burst in sunder: and Daniel said, Behold, these are the gods you° worship.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  028" id="1  028" >28</span>
 When they of Babylon heard that, they took great indignation, and conspired against the king, saying, The king is become a Jew, and he has destroyed Bel, he has slain the dragon, and put the priests to death.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  029" id="1  029" >29</span>
 So they came to the king, and said, Deliver us Daniel, or else we will destroy you and your house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  030" id="1  030" >30</span>
 Now when the king saw that they pressed him sore, being constrained, he delivered Daniel to them:  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  031" id="1  031" >31</span>
 Who cast him into the lions' den: where he was six days.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  032" id="1  032" >32</span>
 And in the den there were seven lions, and they had given them every day two carcases, and two sheep: which then were not given to them, to the intent they might devour Daniel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  033" id="1  033" >33</span>
 Now there was in Jewry a prophet, called Habbacuc, who had made pottage, and had broken bread in a bowl, and was going into the field, for to bring it to the reapers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  034" id="1  034" >34</span>
 But the angel of the Lord said to Habbacuc, Go, carry the dinner that you have into Babylon to Daniel, who is in the lions' den.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  035" id="1  035" >35</span>
 And Habbacuc said, Lord, I never saw Babylon; neither do I know where the den is.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  036" id="1  036" >36</span>
 Then the angel of the Lord took him by the crown, and bare him by the hair of his head, and through the vehemency of his spirit set him in Babylon over the den.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  037" id="1  037" >37</span>
 And Habbacuc cried, saying, O Daniel, Daniel, take the dinner which God has sent you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  038" id="1  038" >38</span>
 And Daniel said, You have remembered me, O God: neither have you forsaken them that seek you and love you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  039" id="1  039" >39</span>
 So Daniel arose, and did eat: and the angel of the Lord set Habbacuc in his own place again immediately.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  040" id="1  040" >40</span>
 Upon the seventh day the king went to bewail Daniel: and when he came to the den, he looked in, and behold, Daniel was sitting.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  041" id="1  041" >41</span>
 Then cried the king with a loud voice, saying, Great are you Lord God of Daniel, and there is none other beside you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0481  042" id="1  042" >42</span>
 And he drew him out, and cast those that were the cause of his destruction into the den: and they were devoured in a moment before his face.
