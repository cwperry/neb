<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the third year of the reign of Joakim king of Juda, came Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 And the Lord gave into his hand Joakim king of Juda, and part of the vessels of the house of God: and he brought them into the land of Sennaar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 And the king told Asphanez his chief eunuch, to bring in some of the captive children of Israel, and of the seed of the kingdom, and of the princes;  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 young men in whom was no blemish, and beautiful in appearance, and skilled in all wisdom, and possessing knowledge, and acquainted with prudence, and who had ability to stand in the house before the king, and the king gave commandment to teach them the learning and language of the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 And the king appointed them a daily portion from the king's table, and from the wine which he drank; and   gave orders   to nourish them three years, and   that   afterwards they should stand before the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 Now these were among them of the children of Juda, Daniel, and Ananias, and Azarias, and Misael.  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 And the chief of the eunuchs gave them names: to Daniel, Baltasar; and to Ananias, Sedrach; and to Misael, Misach; and to Azarias, Abdenago.  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 And Daniel purposed in his heart, that he would not defile himself with the king's table, nor with the wine of his drink: and he entreated the chief of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 Now God   had   brought Daniel into favor and compassion with the chief of the eunuchs.  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your meat and your drink, lest he see your countenances gloomy in comparison of the young men your equals; also shall youÂ° endanger my head to the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 And Daniel said to Amelsad, whom the chief of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Ananias, Misael,   and   Azarias.  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 Prove now your servants ten days; and let them give us pulse, and let us eat, and let us drink water:  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 And let our countenances be seen by you, and the countenances of the children that eat   at   the king's table; and deal with your servants according as you shall see.  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 And he listened to them, and proved them ten days.  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 And at the end of the ten days their countenances appeared fairer and stouter in flesh, than the children that fed at the king's table.  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 So Amelsad took away their supper and the wine of their drink, and gave them pulse.  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 And   as for   these four children, God gave them understanding and prudence in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 And at the end of the days,   after   which the king had given orders to bring them in, then the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nabuchodonosor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 And the king spoke with them; and there were not found out of them all any like Daniel, and Ananias and Misael, and Azarias: and they stood before the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 And in every matter of wisdom and knowledge wherein the king questioned them, he found them ten times wiser than all the enchanters and sorcerers that were in all his kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0271  021" id="1  021" >21</span>
 And Daniel continued till the first year of king Cyrus.  
<!-- 2   021 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> In the second year of   his   reign Nabuchodonosor dreamed a dream, and his spirit was amazed, and his sleep departed from him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 And the king gave orders to call the enchanters, and the magicians, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to declare to the king his dreams. And they came and stood before the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 And the king said to them, I have dreamed, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 And the Chaldeans spoke to the king in the Syrian language,   saying  , O king, live for ever: do you tell the dream to your servants, and we will declare the interpretation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 The king answered the Chaldeans, The thing has departed from me: if youÂ° do not make known to me the dream and the interpretation, youÂ° shall be destroyed, and your houses shall be spoiled.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 But if youÂ° make known to me the dream, and the interpretation thereof, youÂ° shall receive of me gifts and presents and much honor: only tell me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 They answered the second time, and said, Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will declare the interpretation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 And the king answered and said, I verily know that youÂ° are trying to gain time, because youÂ° see that the thing has gone from me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 If then youÂ° do not tell me the dream, I know that youÂ° have concerted to utter before me a false and corrupt tale, until the time shall have past: tell me my dream, and I shall know that youÂ° will also declare to me the interpretation thereof.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is no man upon the earth, who shall be able to make known the king's matter: forasmuch as no great king or ruler asks such a question of an enchanter, magician, or Chaldean.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 For the question which the king asks is difficult, and there is no one else who shall answer it before the king, but the gods, whose dwelling is not with any flesh.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 Then the king in rage and anger commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 So the decree went forth, and they began to kill the wise men; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to kill   them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 Then Daniel answered   with   counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the royal guard, who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon;   saying  ,  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 Chief magistrate of the king, therefore has the preemptory command proceeded from the king? So Arioch made known the matter to Daniel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 And Daniel entreated the king to give him time, and that he might   thus   declare to the king the interpretation of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 So Daniel went into his house, and made known the matter to Ananias, and Misael, and Azarias, his friends.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 And they sought mercies from the God of heaven concerning this mystery; that Daniel and his friends might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night; and Daniel blessed the God of heaven, and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 May the name of God be blessed from everlasting and to everlasting: for wisdom and understanding are his.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 And he changes times and seasons: he appoints kings, and removes   them  , giving wisdom to the wise, and prudence to them that have understanding:  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 he reveals deep and secret   matters  ; knowing what is in darkness, and the light is with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  023" id="2  023" >23</span>
 I give thanks to you, and praise   you  , O God of my fathers, for you have given me wisdom and power, and has made known to me the things which we asked of you; and you have made known to me the king's vision.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  024" id="2  024" >24</span>
 And Daniel came to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and said to him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon, but bring me in before the king, and I will declare the interpretation to the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  025" id="2  025" >25</span>
 Then Arioch in haste brought in Daniel before the king, and said to him, I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judea, who will declare the interpretation to the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  026" id="2  026" >26</span>
 And the king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Baltasar, Canst you declare to me the dream which I saw, and the interpretation thereof?  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  027" id="2  027" >27</span>
 And Daniel answered before the king, and said, The mystery which the king asks   the explanation of   is not   in the power   of the wise men, magicians, enchanters,   or   soothsayers to declare to the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  028" id="2  028" >28</span>
 But there is a God in heaven revealing mysteries, and he has made known to king Nabuchodonosor what things must come to pass in the last days. Your dream, and the visions of your head upon your bed, are as follows,  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  029" id="2  029" >29</span>
 O king: your thoughts upon your bed arose   as to   what must come to pass hereafter: and he that reveals mysteries has made known to you what must come to pass.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  030" id="2  030" >30</span>
 Moreover, this mystery has not been revealed to me by reason of wisdom which is in me beyond all   others   living, but for the sake of making known the interpretation to the king, that you might know the thoughts of your heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  031" id="2  031" >31</span>
 You, O king, saw, and behold an image: that image was great, and the appearance of it excellent, standing before your face; and the form of it was terrible.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  032" id="2  032" >32</span>
    It was   an image, the head of which was of fine gold, its hands and breast and arms of silver,   its   belly and thighs of brass,  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  033" id="2  033" >33</span>
 its legs of iron, its feet, part of iron and part of earthenware.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  034" id="2  034" >34</span>
 You saw until a stone was cut out of a mountain without hands, and it struck the image upon its feet of iron and earthenware, and utterly reduced them to powder.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  035" id="2  035" >35</span>
 Then once for all the earthenware, the iron, the brass, the silver, the gold, were ground to powder, and became as chaff from the summer threshing floor; and the violence of the wind carried them away, and no place was found for them: and the stone which had struck the image became a great mountain, and filled all the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  036" id="2  036" >36</span>
 This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  037" id="2  037" >37</span>
 You, O king, are a king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given a powerful and strong and honorable kingdom,  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  038" id="2  038" >38</span>
 in every place where the children of men dwell: and he has given into your hand the wild beasts of the field, and the birds of the sky and the fish of the sea, and he has made you lord of all.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  039" id="2  039" >39</span>
 You are the head of gold. And after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to you, an a third kingdom which is the brass, which shall have dominion over all the earth;  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  040" id="2  040" >40</span>
 and a fourth kingdom, which shall be strong as iron: as iron beats to powder and subdues all things, so shall it beat to powder and subdue.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  041" id="2  041" >41</span>
 And whereas you saw the feet and the toes, part of earthenware and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; yet there shall be in it of the strength of iron, as you saw the iron mixed with earthenware.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  042" id="2  042" >42</span>
 And   whereas   the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of earthenware, part of the kingdom shall be strong, and   part   of it shall be broken.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  043" id="2  043" >43</span>
 Whereas you saw the iron mixed with earthenware, they shall be mingled with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave together, as the iron does not mix itself with earthenware.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  044" id="2  044" >44</span>
 And in the days of those kings the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and his kingdom shall not be left to another people,   but   it shall beat to pieces and grind to powder all   other   kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  045" id="2  045" >45</span>
 Whereas you saw that a stone was cut out of a mountain without hands, and it beat to pieces the earthenware, the iron, the brass, the silver, the gold; the great God has made known to the king what must happen hereafter: and the dream is true, and the interpretation thereof sure.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  046" id="2  046" >46</span>
 Then king Nabuchodonosor fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and gave orders to offer to him gifts and incense.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  047" id="2  047" >47</span>
 And the king answered and said to Daniel, Of a truth your God is a God of gods, and Lord of kings, who reveals mysteries; for you have been able to reveal this mystery.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  048" id="2  048" >48</span>
 And the king promoted Daniel, and gave him great and abundant gifts, and set him over the whole province of Babylon, and   made him   chief satrap over all the wise men of Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0272  049" id="2  049" >49</span>
 And Daniel asked of the king, and he appointed Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was in the king's palace.  
<!-- 3   049 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> In   his   eighteenth year Nabuchodonosor the king made a golden image, its height was sixty cubits, its breadth six cubits: and he set it up in the plain of Deira, in the province of Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 And he sent forth to gather the governors, and the captains, and the heads of provinces, chiefs, and princes, and those who were in authority, and all the rulers of districts, to come to the dedication of the image.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 So the heads of provinces, the governors, the captains, the chiefs, the great princes, those who were in authority, and all the rulers of districts, were gathered to the dedication of the image which king Nabuchodonosor had set up; and they stood before the image.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 Then a herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, youÂ° peoples, tribes,   and   languages,  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 at what hour youÂ° shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, and sackbut, and lute, and every kind of music, youÂ° shall fall down and worship the golden image which king Nabuchodonosor has set up.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 And whoever shall not fall down and worship, in the same hour he shall be cast into the burning fiery furnace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 And it came to pass when the nations heard the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, and sackbut, and lute, and all kinds of music, all the nations, tribes,   and   languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image which king Nabuchodonosor had set up.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 Then came near   certain   Chaldeans, and accused the Jews to the king,   saying  ,  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 O king, live for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 You, O king, has made a decree that every man who shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, sackbut, and lute, and all kinds of music,  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 and shall not fall down and worship the golden image, shall be cast into the burning fiery furnace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 There are   certain   Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Sedrach, Misach,   and   Abdenago, who have not obeyed your decree, O king: they serve not your gods, and worship not the golden image which you have set up.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 Then Nabuchodonosor in wrath and anger commanded to bring Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago: and they were brought before the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 And Nabuchodonosor answered and said to them, Is it true, Sedrach, Misach,   and   Abdenago, that youÂ° serve not my gods, and worship not the golden image which I have set up?  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 Now then if youÂ° be ready, whenever youÂ° shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, and sackbut, and lute, and harmony, and every kind of music, to fall down and worship the golden image which I have made;   well  : but if youÂ° worship not, in the same hour youÂ° shall be cast into the burning fiery furnace; and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hand?  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 Then answered Sedrach, Misach   and   Abdenago and said to king Nabuchodonosor, We have no need to answer you concerning this matter.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 For our God whom we serve is in the heavens, able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will rescue us from your hands, O king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we   will   not serve your gods, nor worship the image which you have set up.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  019" id="3  019" >19</span>
 Then Nabuchodonosor was filled with wrath, and the form of his countenance was changed toward Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago: and he gave orders to heat the furnace seven times   more than usual  , until it should burn to the uttermost.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  020" id="3  020" >20</span>
 And he commanded mighty men to bind Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and to cast   them   into the burning fiery furnace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  021" id="3  021" >21</span>
 Then those men were bound with their coats, and caps, and hose, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace,  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  022" id="3  022" >22</span>
 forasmuch as the king's word prevailed; and the furnace was made exceeding hot.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  023" id="3  023" >23</span>
 Then these three men, Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, fell bound into the midst of the burning furnace, and walked in the midst of the flame, singing praise to God, and blessing the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  024" id="3  024" >24</span>
 And Nabuchodonosor heard them singing praises; and he wondered, and rose up in haste, and said to his nobles, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? and they said to the king, Yes, O king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  025" id="3  025" >25</span>
 And the king said, But I see four men loose, and walking in the midst of the fire, and there has no harm happened to them; and the appearance of the fourth is like the Son of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  026" id="3  026" >26</span>
 Then Nabuchodonosor drew near to the door of the burning fiery furnace, and said, Sedrach, Misach,   and   Abdenago, youÂ° servants of the most high God, proceed forth, and come here. So Sedrach, Misach,   and   Abdenago, came forth out of the midst of the fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  027" id="3  027" >27</span>
 Then were assembled the satraps, and captains, and heads of provinces, and the royal princes; and they saw the men,   and perceived   that the fire had not had power against their bodies, and the hair of their head was not burnt, and their coats were not scorched, nor was the smell of fire upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  028" id="3  028" >28</span>
 And king Nabuchodonosor answered and said, Blessed be the God of Sedrach, Misach,   and   Abdenago, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants, because they trusted in him; and they have changed the king's word, and delivered their bodies to be burnt, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  029" id="3  029" >29</span>
 Therefore I publish a decree: Every people, tribe,   or   language, that shall speak reproachfully against the God of Sedrach, Misach,   and   Abdenago shall be destroyed, and their houses shall be plundered: because there is no other God who shall be able to deliver thus.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  030" id="3  030" >30</span>
 Then the king promoted Sedrach, Misach,   and   Abdenago, in the province of Babylon, and advanced them, and gave them authority to rule over all the Jews who were in his kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  031" id="3  031" >31</span>
 King Nabuchodonosor to all nations, tribes, and tongues, who dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  032" id="3  032" >32</span>
 It seemed good to me to declare to you the signs and wonders which the most high God has wrought with me,  <span class="verse" rel="v0273  033" id="3  033" >33</span>
 how great and mighty   they are  : his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his power to all generations.

<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> I Nabuchodonosor was thriving in my house, and prospering.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 I saw a vision, and it terrified me, and I was troubled on my bed, and the visions of my head troubled me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 And I made a decree to bring in before me all the wise men of Babylon, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 So the enchanters, magicians, soothsayers,   and   Chaldeans came in: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known to me the interpretation thereof;  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  005" id="4  005" >5</span>
 until Daniel came, whose name is Baltasar, according to the name of my God, who has within him the Holy Spirit of God; to whom I said,  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 O Baltasar, chief of the enchanters, of whom I know that the Holy Spirit of God is in you, and no mystery is too hard for you, hear the vision of my dream which I had, and tell me the interpretation of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 I had a vision upon my bed; and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 The tree grew large and strong, and its height reached to the sky, and its extent to the extremity of the whole earth:  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 its leaves were fair, and its fruit abundant, and in it was meat for all; and under it the wild beasts of the field took shelter, and the birds of the sky lodged in the branches of it, and all flesh was fed of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 I [*]saw in the night vision upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven and cried aloud, and thus he said,  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 Cut down the tree, and pluck off its branches, and shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the wild beasts be removed from under it, and the birds from its branches.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 Only leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and   bind it   with an iron and brass band; and it shall lie in the grass that is without and in the dew of heaven, and its portion   shall be   with the wild beasts in the grass of the field.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 His heart shall be changed from that of man, and the heart of a wild beast shall be given to him; and seven times shall pass over him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  014" id="4  014" >14</span>
 The matter is by the decree of the watcher, and the demand is a word of the holy ones; that the living may known that the Lord is most high   over   the kingdom of men, and he will give it to whoever he shall please, and will set up over it that which is set at nothing of men.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  015" id="4  015" >15</span>
 This is the vision which I king Nabuchodonosor saw: and do you, Baltasar, declare the interpretation, for none of the wise men of my kingdom are able to show me the interpretation of it: but you, Daniel, are able; for the Holy Spirit of God is in you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  016" id="4  016" >16</span>
 Then Daniel, whose name is Baltasar, was amazed about one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. And Baltasar answered and said,   My   lord, let the dream be to them that hate you, and the interpretation of it to your enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  017" id="4  017" >17</span>
 The tree which you saw, that grew large and strong, whose height reached to the sky and its extent to all the earth;  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  018" id="4  018" >18</span>
 and whose leaves were flourishing, and its fruit abundant, (and it was meat for all; under it the wild beasts lodged, and the birds of the sky took shelter in its branches:)  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  019" id="4  019" >19</span>
 is yourself, O king; for you are grown great and powerful, and your greatness has increased and reached to heaven, and your dominion to the ends of the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  020" id="4  020" >20</span>
 And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and he said, Strip the tree, and destroy it; only leave the stump of its roots in the ground, and   bind it   with a band of iron and brass; and it shall lie in the grass that is without, and in the dew of heaven, and its portion shall be with wild beasts, until seven times have passed over it;  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  021" id="4  021" >21</span>
 this is the interpretation of it, O king, and it is a decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  022" id="4  022" >22</span>
 And they shall drive you forth from men, and your dwelling shall be with wild beasts, and they shall feed you with grass as an ox, and you shall have your lodging under the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over you, until you known that the Most High is Lord of the kingdom of men, and will give it to whom he shall please.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  023" id="4  023" >23</span>
 And whereas they said, Leave the stumps of the roots of the tree; your kingdom abides   sure   to you from the time that you shall know the power of the heavens.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  024" id="4  024" >24</span>
 Therefore, O king, let my counsel please you, and atone for your sins by alms, and   your   iniquities by compassion on the poor: it may be God will be longsuffering to your trespasses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  025" id="4  025" >25</span>
 All these things came upon king Nabuchodonosor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  026" id="4  026" >26</span>
 After a twelvemonth, as he walked in his palace in Babylon,  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  027" id="4  027" >27</span>
 the king answered and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for a royal residence, by the might of my power, for the honor of my glory?  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  028" id="4  028" >28</span>
 While the word was yet in the king's mouth, there came a voice from heaven,   saying  , To you, king Nabuchodonosor, they say, The kingdom has departed from you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  029" id="4  029" >29</span>
 And they   shall   drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the wild beasts of the field, and they shall feed you with grass as an ox: and seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High is Lord of the kingdom of men, and he will give it to whoever he shall please.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  030" id="4  030" >30</span>
 In the same hour the word was fulfilled upon Nabuchodonosor: and he was driven forth from men, and he ate grass as an ox, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven, until his hairs were grown like lions'   hairs  , and his nails as birds'   claws  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  031" id="4  031" >31</span>
 And at the end of the time I Nabuchodonosor lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised him that lives for ever, and gave   him   glory; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom   lasts   to all generations:  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  032" id="4  032" >32</span>
 and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and there is none who shall withstand his power, and say to him, What has you done?  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  033" id="4  033" >33</span>
 At the same time my reason returned to me, and I came to the honor of my kingdom; and my   natural   form returned to me, and my princes, and my nobles, sought me, and I was established in my kingdom, and more abundant majesty was added to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0274  034" id="4  034" >34</span>
 Now therefore I Nabuchodonosor praise and greatly exalt and glorify the King of heaven; for all his works are true, and his paths are judgment: and all that walk in pride he is able to abase.  
<!-- 5   034 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> Baltasar the king made a great supper for his thousand nobles, and   there was   wine before the thousand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 And Baltasar drinking gave orders as he tasted the wine that they should bring the gold and silver vessels, which Nabuchodonosor his father had brought forth from the temple in Jerusalem; that the king, and his nobles, and his mistresses, and his concubines, should drink out of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 So the gold and silver vessels were brought which   Nabuchodonosor   had taken out of the temple of God in Jerusalem; and the king, and his nobles, and his mistresses, and his concubines, drank out of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of iron, and of wood, and of stone.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote in front of the lamp on the plaster of the wall of the king's house: and the king saw the knuckles of the hand that wrote.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 Then the king's countenance changed, and his thoughts troubled him, and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees struck one another.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 And the king cried aloud to bring in the magicians, Chaldeans,   and   soothsayers; and he said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and make known to me the interpretation, shall be clothed with scarlet, and   there shall be   a golden chain upon his neck, and he shall be the third ruler in my kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known the interpretation to the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 And king Baltasar was troubled, and his countenance changed upon him, and his nobles were troubled with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 Then the queen came into the banquet house, and said, O king, live for ever: let not your thoughts trouble you, and let not your countenance be changed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  011" id="5  011" >11</span>
 There is a man in your kingdom, in whom is the Spirit of God; and in the days of your father watchfulness and understanding were found in him; and king Nabuchodonosor your father made him chief of the enchanters, magicians, Chaldeans,   and   soothsayers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  012" id="5  012" >12</span>
 For   there is   an excellent spirit in him, and sense and understanding in him, interpreting dreams   as he does  , and answering hard   questions  , and solving difficulties:   it is   Daniel, and the king gave him the name of Baltasar: now then let him be called, and he shall tell you the interpretation of the writing.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  013" id="5  013" >13</span>
 Then Daniel was brought in before the king: and the king said to Daniel, Are you Daniel, of the children of the captivity of Judea, which the king my father brought?  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 I have heard concerning you, that the Spirit of God is in you, and   that   watchfulness and understanding and excellent wisdom have been found in you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  015" id="5  015" >15</span>
 And now, the wise men, magicians,   and   soothsayers, have come in before me, to read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation: but they could not tell it me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  016" id="5  016" >16</span>
 And I have heard concerning you, that you are able to make interpretations: now then if you shall be able to read the writing, and to make known to me the interpretation of it, you shall be clothed with purple, and there shall be a golden chain upon your neck, and you shall be third ruler in my kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  017" id="5  017" >17</span>
 And Daniel said, before the king, Let your gifts be to yourself, and give the present of your house to another; but I will read the writing, and will make known to you the interpretation of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  018" id="5  018" >18</span>
 O king, the most high God gave to your father Nabuchodonosor a kingdom, and majesty, and honor, and glory:  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  019" id="5  019" >19</span>
 and by reason of the majesty which he gave to him, all nations, tribes,   and   languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he killed; and whom he would he struck; and whom he would he exalted; and whom he would he abased.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  020" id="5  020" >20</span>
 But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was emboldened to act proudly, he was deposed from his royal throne, and   his   honor was taken from him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  021" id="5  021" >21</span>
 And he was driven forth from men; and his heart was given him after the nature of wild beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; and they fed him with grass as an ox, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven; until he knew that the most high God is Lord of the kingdom of men, and will give it to whoever he shall please.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  022" id="5  022" >22</span>
 And you accordingly, his son, O Baltasar, has not humbled your heart before God: know you not all this?  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  023" id="5  023" >23</span>
 And you have been exalted against the Lord God of heaven; and they have brought before you the vessels of his house, and you, and your nobles, and your mistresses, and your concubines, have drunk wine out of them; and you have praised the gods of gold, and silver, and brass, and iron, and wood, and stone, which see not, and which hear not, and know not: and the God in whose hand are your breath, and all your ways has you not glorified.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  024" id="5  024" >24</span>
 Therefore from his presence has been sent forth the knuckle of a hand; and he has ordered the writing.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  025" id="5  025" >25</span>
 And this is the ordered writing, Mane, Thekel, Phares.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  026" id="5  026" >26</span>
 This is the interpretation of the sentence: Mane; God has measured your kingdom, and finished it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  027" id="5  027" >27</span>
 Thekel; it has been weighed in the balance, and found lacking.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  028" id="5  028" >28</span>
 Phares; your kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  029" id="5  029" >29</span>
 Then Baltasar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put the golden chain about his neck, and proclaimed concerning him that he was the third ruler in the kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  030" id="5  030" >30</span>
 In the same night was Baltasar the Chaldean king slain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0275  031" id="5  031" >31</span>
 And Darius the Mede succeeded to the kingdom, being sixty-two years   old  .  
<!-- 6   031 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="6  001">6  </span> And it pleased Darius, and he set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, to be in all his kingdom;  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  002" id="6  002" >2</span>
 and over them three governors, of whom one was, Daniel; for the satraps to give account to them, that the king should not be troubled.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  003" id="6  003" >3</span>
 And Daniel was over them, for   there was   an excellent spirit in him; and the king set him over all his kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  004" id="6  004" >4</span>
 Then the governors and satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel; but they found against him no occasion, nor trespass, nor error, because he was faithful.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  005" id="6  005" >5</span>
 And the governors said, We shall not find occasion against Daniel, except in the ordinances of his God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  006" id="6  006" >6</span>
 Then the governors and satraps stood by the king, and said to him, King Darius, live for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  007" id="6  007" >7</span>
 All who preside over your kingdom, captains and satraps, chiefs and local governors, have taken counsel together, to establish by a royal statue and to confirm a decree, that whoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  008" id="6  008" >8</span>
 Now then, O king, establish the decree, and publish a writ, that the decree of the Persians and Medes be not changed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  009" id="6  009" >9</span>
 Then king Darius commanded the decree to be written.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  010" id="6  010" >10</span>
 And when Daniel knew that the decree was ordered, he went into his house; and his windows were opened in his chambers toward Jerusalem, and three times in the day he knelt upon his knees, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he used to do before.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  011" id="6  011" >11</span>
 Then these men watched, and found Daniel praying and supplicating to his God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  012" id="6  012" >12</span>
 And they came and said to the king, O king, has you not made a decree, that whatever man shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, but of you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? And the king said, The word is true, and the decree of the Medes and Persians shall not pass.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  013" id="6  013" >13</span>
 Then they answered and said before the king, Daniel of the children of the captivity of Judea, has not submitted to your decree; and three times in the day he makes his requests of his God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  014" id="6  014" >14</span>
 Then the king, when he heard the saying, was much grieved for Daniel and he greatly exerted himself for Daniel to deliver him: and he exerted himself till evening to deliver him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  015" id="6  015" >15</span>
 Then those men said to the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is that we must not change any decree of statue which the king shall make.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  016" id="6  016" >16</span>
 Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. But the king said to Daniel, Your God whom you serve continually, he will deliver you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  017" id="6  017" >17</span>
 And they brought a stone, and put it on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed   it   with his ring, and with the ring of his nobles; that the case might not be altered with regard to Daniel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  018" id="6  018" >18</span>
 And the king departed to his house, and lay down fasting, and they brought him no food; and his sleep departed from him. But God shut the mouths of the lions, and they not molest Daniel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  019" id="6  019" >19</span>
 Then the king arose very early in the morning, and came in have to the den of lions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  020" id="6  020" >20</span>
 And when he drew near to the den, he cried with a loud voice, Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lion's mouth?  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  021" id="6  021" >21</span>
 And Daniel said to the king, O king, live for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  022" id="6  022" >22</span>
 My God has sent his angel, and stopped the lions' mouths, and they have not hurt me: for uprightness was found in me before him; and moreover before you, O king, I have committed no trespass.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  023" id="6  023" >23</span>
 Then the king was very glad for him, and he commanded to bring Daniel out of the den. So Daniel was brought out of the den, and there was found no hurt upon him, because he believed in his God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  024" id="6  024" >24</span>
 And the king commanded, and they brought the men that had accused Daniel, and they were cast into the den of lions, they, and their children, and their wives: and they reached not the bottom of the den before the lions had the mastery of them, and utterly broke to pieces all their bones.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  025" id="6  025" >25</span>
 Then king Darius wrote to all nations, tribes,   and   languages, who dwell in all the earth,   saying  , Peace be multiplied to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  026" id="6  026" >26</span>
 This decree has been set forth by me in every dominion of my kingdom, that   men   tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living and eternal God, and his kingdom shall not be destroyed, and his dominion is for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  027" id="6  027" >27</span>
 He helps and delivers, and works signs and wonders in the heaven and on the earth, who has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0276  028" id="6  028" >28</span>
 And Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

<p><span class="chapter" id="7  001">7  </span> In the first year of Baltasar, king of the Chaldeans Daniel had a dream, and visions of his head upon his bed: and he wrote his dream.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  002" id="7  002" >2</span>
 I Daniel [*]saw, and, behold, the four winds of heaven blew violently upon the great sea.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  003" id="7  003" >3</span>
 And there came up four great beasts out of the sea, differing from one another.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  004" id="7  004" >4</span>
 The first   was   as a lioness, and her wings as an eagle's; I [*]saw until her wings were plucked, ands she was lifted off from the earth, and she stood on human feet, and a man's heart was given to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  005" id="7  005" >5</span>
 And, behold, a second beast like a bear, and it supported itself on one side, and there were three ribs in its mouth, between its teeth: and thus they said to it, Arise, devour much flesh.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  006" id="7  006" >6</span>
 After this one I looked, and behold another wild beast as a leopard, and it had four wings of a bird upon it: and the wild beast had four heads, and power was given to it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  007" id="7  007" >7</span>
 After this one I looked, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and exceedingly strong, and its teeth were of iron; devouring and crushing to atoms, and it trampled the remainder with its feet: and it was altogether different from the beasts that were before it; and it   had   ten hours.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  008" id="7  008" >8</span>
 I noticed his horns, and behold, another little horn came up in the midst of them, and before it three of the former horns were rooted out: and, behold,   there were   eyes as the eyes of a man in this horn, and a mouth speaking great things.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  009" id="7  009" >9</span>
 I [*]saw until the thrones were set, and the Ancient of days sat; and his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head, as pure wool: his throne was a flame of fire,   and   his wheels burning fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  010" id="7  010" >10</span>
 A stream of fire rushed forth before him: thousand thousands ministered to him, and ten thousands of myriads, attended upon him: the judgment sat, and the books were opened.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  011" id="7  011" >11</span>
 I [*]saw then because of the voice of the great words which that horn spoke, until the wild beast was slain and destroyed, and his body given to be burnt with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  012" id="7  012" >12</span>
 And the dominion of the rest of the wild beasts was taken away; but a prolonging of life was given them for certain times.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  013" id="7  013" >13</span>
 I [*]saw in the night vision, and, behold,   one   coming with the clouds of heaven as the Son of man, and he came on to the Ancient of days, and was brought near to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  014" id="7  014" >14</span>
 And to him was given the dominion, and the honor, and the kingdom; and all nations, tribes, and languages, shall serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom shall not be destroyed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  015" id="7  015" >15</span>
    As for   me Daniel, my spirit in my body trembled, and the visions of my head troubled me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  016" id="7  016" >16</span>
 And I drew near to one of them that stood by, and I sought to learn of him the truth of all these things: and he told me the truth, and made known to me the interpretation of the things.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  017" id="7  017" >17</span>
 These four beasts are four kingdoms   that   shall rise up on the earth:  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  018" id="7  018" >18</span>
 which shall be taken away; and the saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom, and possess it for ever and ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  019" id="7  019" >19</span>
 Then I enquired carefully concerning the fourth beast; for it differed from every   other   beast, exceeding dreadful: its teeth were of iron, and its claws of brass, devouring, and utterly breaking to pieces, and it trampled the remainder with its feet:  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  020" id="7  020" >20</span>
 and concerning it ten horns that were in its head, and the other that came up, and rooted up   some   of the former, which had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, and his look was bolder than the rest.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  021" id="7  021" >21</span>
 I [*]saw, and that horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  022" id="7  022" >22</span>
 until the Ancient of days came, and he gave judgment to the saints of the Most High; and the time came on, and the saints possessed the kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  023" id="7  023" >23</span>
 And he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on the earth, which shall excel all   other   kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and trample and destroy it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  024" id="7  024" >24</span>
 And his ten horns are ten kings   that   shall arise: and after them shall arise another, who shall exceed all the former ones in wickedness and he shall subdue three kings.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  025" id="7  025" >25</span>
 And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change times and law: and   power   shall be given into his hand for a time and times and half a time.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  026" id="7  026" >26</span>
 And the judgment has sat, and they shall remove   his   dominion to abolish it, and to destroy it utterly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  027" id="7  027" >27</span>
 And the kingdom and the power and the greatness of the kings that are under the whole heaven were given to the saints of the Most High; and his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all powers shall serve and obey him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0277  028" id="7  028" >28</span>
 Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts greatly troubled me, and my countenance was changed: but I kept the matter in my heart.  
<!-- 8   028 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> In the third year of the reign of king Baltasar a vision appeared to me,   even   to me Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 And I was in Susa the palace, which is in the land of Aelam, and I was on the   bank of   Ubal.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 And I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, a ram standing in front of the Ubal; and he had high horns; and one was higher than the other, and the high one came up last.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  004" id="8  004" >4</span>
 And I saw the ram butting westward, and northward, and southward; and no beast could stand before him, and there was none that could deliver out of his hand; and he did according to his will, and became great.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 And I was considering, and, behold, a he-goat came from the southwest on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the earth: and the goat   had   a horn between his eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 And he came to the ram that had the horns, which I had seen standing in front of the Ubal, and he ran at him with the violence of his strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  007" id="8  007" >7</span>
 And I saw him coming up close to the ram, and he was furiously enraged against him, and he struck the ram, and broke both his horns: and there was no strength in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him on the ground, and trampled on him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  008" id="8  008" >8</span>
 And the he-goat grew exceedingly great: and when he was strong, his great horn was broken; and four other   horns   rose up in its place toward the four winds of heaven.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 And out of one of them came forth one strong horn, and it grew very great toward the south, and toward the host:  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 and it magnified itself to the host of heaven; and there fell to the earth   some   of the host of heaven and of the stars, and they trampled on them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  011" id="8  011" >11</span>
 And   this shall be   until the chief captain shall have delivered the captivity: and by reason of him the sacrifice was disturbed, and he prospered; and the holy place shall be made desolate.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  012" id="8  012" >12</span>
 And a sin-offering was given for the sacrifice, and righteousness was cast down to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 And I heard one saint speaking, and a saint said to a certain one speaking, How long shall the vision continue,   even   the removal of the sacrifice, and the bringing in of the sin of desolation; and   how long   shall the sanctuary and host be trampled?  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 And he said to him, Evening and morning   there shall be   two thousand and four hundred days; and   then   the sanctuary shall be cleansed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  015" id="8  015" >15</span>
 And it came to pass, as I,   even   I Daniel, saw the vision, and sought to understand it, that, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  016" id="8  016" >16</span>
 And I heard the voice of a man between   the banks of   the Ubal; and he called, and said, Gabriel, cause that man to understand the vision.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  017" id="8  017" >17</span>
 And he came and stood near where I stood: and when he came, I was struck with awe, and fell upon my face: but he said to me, Understand, son of man: for yet the vision is for an appointed time.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  018" id="8  018" >18</span>
 And while he spoke with me, I fell upon my face to the earth: and he touched me, and set me on my feet.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  019" id="8  019" >19</span>
 And he said, Behold, I make you know the things that shall come to pass at the end of the wrath: for the vision   is   yet for an appointed time.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  020" id="8  020" >20</span>
 The ram which you saw that had the horns is the king of the Medes and Persians.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  021" id="8  021" >21</span>
 The he-goat is the King of the Greeks: and the great horn which was between his eyes, he is the first king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  022" id="8  022" >22</span>
 And   as for   the one that was broken, in whose place there stood up four horns, four kings shall arise out of his nation, but not in their   own   strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  023" id="8  023" >23</span>
 And at the latter time of their kingdom, when their sins are coming to the full, there shall arise a king bold in countenance, and understanding riddles.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  024" id="8  024" >24</span>
 And his power   shall be   great, and he shall destroy wonderfully, and prosper, and practise, and shall destroy mighty men, and the holy people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  025" id="8  025" >25</span>
 And the yoke of his chain shall prosper:   there is   craft in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by craft shall destroy many, and he shall stand up for the destruction of many, and shall crush them as eggs in his hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  026" id="8  026" >26</span>
 And the vision of the evening and morning that was mentioned is true: and do you seal the vision; for   it is   for many days.  <span class="verse" rel="v0278  027" id="8  027" >27</span>
 And I Daniel fell asleep, and was sick: then I arose, and did the king's business; and I wondered at the vision, and there was none that understood   it  .

<p><span class="chapter" id="9  001">9  </span> In the first year of Darius the son of Assuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who reigned over the kingdom of the Chaldeans,  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  002" id="9  002" >2</span>
 I Daniel understood by books the number of the years which was the word of the Lord to the prophet Jeremias,   even   seventy years for the accomplishment of the desolation of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  003" id="9  003" >3</span>
 And I set my face toward the Lord God, to seek   him   diligently by prayer and supplications, with fastings and sackcloth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  004" id="9  004" >4</span>
 And I prayed to the Lord my God, and confessed, and said, O Lord, the great and wonderful God, keeping your covenant and your mercy to them that love you, and to them that keep your commandments; we have sinned,  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  005" id="9  005" >5</span>
 we have done iniquity, we have transgressed, and we have departed and turned aside from your commandments and from your judgments:  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
 and we have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, and our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 To you, O Lord,   belongs   righteousness, an to us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Juda, and to the dwellers in Jerusalem, and to all Israel, to them that are near, and to them that are far off in all the earth, wherever you have scattered them, for the sin which they committed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 In you, O Lord, is our righteousness, and to us   belongs   confusion of faced, and to our kings, and to our princes, and to our fathers, forasmuch as we have sinned.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 To you, the Lord our God,   belong   compassions and forgivenesses, whereas we have departed   from you  ;  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  010" id="9  010" >10</span>
 neither have we listened to the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by the hands of his servants the prophets.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  011" id="9  011" >11</span>
 Moreover all Israel have transgressed your law, and have refused to listen to your voice; so the curse has come upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  012" id="9  012" >12</span>
 And he has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges who judged us,   by   bringing upon us great evils, such as have not happened under the whole heaven, according to what has happened in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  013" id="9  013" >13</span>
 As it is written in the law of Moses, all these evils have come upon us: yet we have not implored the Lord our God, that we might turn away from our iniquities, and have understanding in all your truth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  014" id="9  014" >14</span>
 The Lord also has watched, and brought the evils upon us: for the Lord our God is righteous in all his work which he has executed, but we have not listened to his voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  015" id="9  015" >15</span>
 And now, O Lord our God, who brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and made to yourself a name, as   at   this day; we have sinned, we have transgressed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  016" id="9  016" >16</span>
 O Lord, your mercy is over all: let, I pray you, your wrath turn away, and your anger from your city Jerusalem,   even   your holy mountain: for we have sinned, and because of our iniquities, and those of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people are become a reproach among all that are round about us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  017" id="9  017" >17</span>
 And now, O lord our God, listen to the prayer of your servant, and his supplications, and cause your face to shine on your desolate sanctuary, for your   own   sake, O Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  018" id="9  018" >18</span>
 Incline your ear, O my God, and hear; open your eyes and behold our desolation, and that of your city on which your name is called: for we do not bring our pitiful case before you on   the ground of   our righteousness, but on   the ground of   your manifold compassions, O Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  019" id="9  019" >19</span>
 Listen, O Lord; be propitious, O Lord; attend, O Lord; delay not, O my God, for your own sake: for your name is called upon your city and upon your people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  020" id="9  020" >20</span>
 And while I was yet speaking, and praying, and confessing my sins and the sins of my people Israel, and bringing my pitiful case before the Lord my God concerning the holy mountain;  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  021" id="9  021" >21</span>
 yes, while I was yet speaking in prayer, behold the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning,   came   flying, and he touched me about the hour of the evening sacrifice.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  022" id="9  022" >22</span>
 And he instructed me, and spoke with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to impart to you understanding.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  023" id="9  023" >23</span>
 At the beginning of your supplication the word came forth, and I am come to tell you; for you are a man much beloved: therefore consider the matter, understand the vision.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  024" id="9  024" >24</span>
 Seventy weeks have been determined upon your people, and upon the holy city, for sin to be ended, and to seal up transgressions, and to blot out the iniquities, and to make atonement for iniquities, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal the vision and the prophet, and to anoint the Most Holy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  025" id="9  025" >25</span>
 And you shall know and understand, that from the going forth of the command for the answer and for the building of Jerusalem until Christ the prince   there shall be   seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks; and then   the time   shall return, and the street shall be built, and the wall, and the times shall be exhausted.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  026" id="9  026" >26</span>
 And after the sixty-two weeks, the anointed one shall be destroyed, and there is no judgment in him: and he shall destroy the city and the sanctuary with the prince that is coming: they shall be cut off with a flood, and to the end of the war which is rapidly completed he shall appoint   the city   to desolations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0279  027" id="9  027" >27</span>
 And one week shall establish the covenant with many: and in the midst of the week my sacrifice and drink-offering shall be taken away: and on the temple   shall be   the abomination of desolations; and at the end of time an end shall be put to the desolation.

<p><span class="chapter" id="10  001">10  </span> In the third year of Cyrus king of the Persians a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Baltasar; and the thing was true, and great power and understanding in the vision was given to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  002" id="10  002" >2</span>
 In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  003" id="10  003" >3</span>
 I ate no pleasant bread, and no flesh or wine entered into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself with oil, until three whole weeks were accomplished.  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  004" id="10  004" >4</span>
 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, I was near the great river, which is Tigris Eddekel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  005" id="10  005" >5</span>
 And I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a man clothed in linen, and his loins were girded with gold of Ophaz:  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  006" id="10  006" >6</span>
 and his body was as Tharsis, and his face was a the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his legs as the appearance of shining brass, and the voice of his words as the voice of a multitude.  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  007" id="10  007" >7</span>
 And I Daniel only saw the vision: and the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great amazement fell upon them, and they fled in fear.  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  008" id="10  008" >8</span>
 So I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there was no strength left in me, and my glory was turned into corruption, and I retained no strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  009" id="10  009" >9</span>
 Yet I heard the voice of his words: and when I heard him I was pricked   in the heart  , and   I fell with   my face to the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  010" id="10  010" >10</span>
 And, behold, a hand touched me, and it raised me on my knees.  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  011" id="10  011" >11</span>
 And he said to me, O Daniel, man greatly beloved, understand the words which I speak to you, and stand upright: for I am now sent to you. And when he had spoken to me this word, I stood trembling.  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  012" id="10  012" >12</span>
 And he said to me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that you did set your heart to understand, and to afflict yourself before the Lord your God, they words were heard, and I am come because of your words.  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  013" id="10  013" >13</span>
 But the prince of the kingdom of the Persians withstood me twenty-one days: and behold, Michael, one of the princes, came to help me; and I left him there with the chief of the kingdom of the Persians:  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  014" id="10  014" >14</span>
 and I have come to inform you of all that shall befall your people in the last days: for the vision is yet for   many   days.  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  015" id="10  015" >15</span>
 And when he had spoken with me according to these words, I turned my face to the ground, and was pricked   in the heart  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  016" id="10  016" >16</span>
 And, behold, as it were the likeness of a son of man touched my lips; and I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said to him that stood before me, O   my   lord, at the sight of you my bowels were turned within me, and I had no strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  017" id="10  017" >17</span>
 And how shall your servant be able, O   my   lord, to speak with this my lord? and as for me, from henceforth strength will not remain in me, and there is no breath left in me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  018" id="10  018" >18</span>
 And there touched me again as it were the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  019" id="10  019" >19</span>
 and said to me, Fear not, man greatly beloved: peace be to you, quit yourself like a man, and be strong. And when he had spoken with me, I received strength, and said, Let my lord speak; for you have strengthened me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  020" id="10  020" >20</span>
 And he said, Know you, therefore I am come to you? and now I will return to fight with the prince of the Persians: and I was going in, and the prince of the Greeks came.  <span class="verse" rel="v02710  021" id="10  021" >21</span>
 But I will tell you that which is ordained in the scripture of truth: and there is no one that holds with me in these matters but Michael your prince.

<p><span class="chapter" id="11  001">11  </span> And I in the first year of Cyrus stood to strengthen and confirm   him  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  002" id="11  002" >2</span>
 And now I will tell you the truth. Behold, there shall yet rise up three kings in Persia: and the fourth shall be very far richer than all: and after that he is master of his wealth, he shall rise up against all the kingdoms of the Greeks.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  003" id="11  003" >3</span>
 An there shall rise up a mighty king, and he shall be lord of a great empire, and shall do according to his will.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  004" id="11  004" >4</span>
 And when his kingdom shall stand up, it shall be broken, and shall be divided to the four winds of heaven; but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled over: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, and   given   to others beside these.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  005" id="11  005" >5</span>
 And the king of the south shall be strong; and one of their princes shall prevail against him, and shall obtain a great dominion.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  006" id="11  006" >6</span>
 And after his years they shall associate; and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north, to make agreements with him: but she shall not retain power of arm; neither shall his seed stand: and she shall be delivered up, and they that brought her, and the maiden, and he that strengthened her in these times.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  007" id="11  007" >7</span>
    But   out of the flower of her root there shall arise   one on   his place, and shall come against the host, and shall enter into the strongholds of the king of the north, and shall fight against them, and prevail.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  008" id="11  008" >8</span>
 Yes, he shall carry with a body of captives into Egypt their gods with their molten   images, and   all their precious vessels of silver and gold; and he shall last longer than the king of the north.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  009" id="11  009" >9</span>
 And he shall enter into the kingdom of the king of the south, and shall return to his own land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  010" id="11  010" >10</span>
 And his sons shall gather a multitude among many: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through, and he shall rest, and collect his strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  011" id="11  011" >11</span>
 And the king of the south shall be greatly enraged, and shall come forth, and shall war with the king of the north: and he shall raise a great multitude; but the multitude shall be delivered into his hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  012" id="11  012" >12</span>
 And he shall take the multitude, and his heart shall be exalted; and he shall cast down many thousands; but he shall not prevail.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  013" id="11  013" >13</span>
 For the king of the north shall return, and bring a multitude greater than the former, and at the end of the times of years an invading army shall come with a great force, and with much substance.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  014" id="11  014" >14</span>
 And in those times many shall rise up against the king of the south; and the children of the spoilers of your people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; and they shall fail.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  015" id="11  015" >15</span>
 And the king of the north shall come in, and cast up a mound, and take strong cities: and the arms of the king of the south shall withstand, and his chosen ones shall rise up, but there shall be no strength to stand.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  016" id="11  016" >16</span>
 And he that comes in against him shall do according to his will, and there is no one to stand before him: and he shall stand in the land of beauty, and it shall be consumed by his hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  017" id="11  017" >17</span>
 And he shall set his face to come in with the force of his whole kingdom, and shall cause everything to prosper with him: and he shall give him the daughter of women to corrupt her: but she shall not continue, neither be on his side.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  018" id="11  018" >18</span>
 And he shall turn his face to the islands, and shall take many, and cause princes to cease from their reproach: nevertheless his own reproach shall return to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  019" id="11  019" >19</span>
 Then he shall turn back his face to the strength of his own land: but he shall become weak, and fall, and not be found.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  020" id="11  020" >20</span>
 And there shall arise out of his root one that shall cause a plant of the kingdom to pass over his place, earning kingly glory: and yet in those days shall he be broken, yet not openly, nor in war.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  021" id="11  021" >21</span>
    One   shall stand on his place,   who   has been set a nothing, and they have not put upon him the honor of the kingdom: but he shall come in prosperously, and obtain the kingdom by deceitful ways.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  022" id="11  022" >22</span>
 And the arms of him that overflows shall be washed away as with a flood from before him, and shall be broken, and   so shall be   the head of the covenant.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  023" id="11  023" >23</span>
 And because of the leagues made with him he shall work deceit: and he shall come up, and overpower them with a small nation.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  024" id="11  024" >24</span>
 And he shall enter with prosperity, and   that   into fertile districts; and he shall do what his fathers and his fathers' fathers have not done; he shall scatter among them plunder, and spoils, and wealth; and he shall devise plans against Egypt, even for a time.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  025" id="11  025" >25</span>
 And his strength and his heart shall be stirred up against the king of the south with a great force; and the king of the south shall engage in war with a great and very strong force; but   his forces   shall not stand, for they shall devise plans against him:  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  026" id="11  026" >26</span>
 and they shall eat his provisions, and shall crush him, and he shall carry away armies as with a flood, and many shall fall down slain.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  027" id="11  027" >27</span>
 And   as for   both the kings, their hearts   are set   upon mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper; for yet the end is for a   fixed   time.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  028" id="11  028" >28</span>
 And he shall return to his land with much substance; and his heart   shall be   against the holy covenant; and he shall perform   great deeds  , and return to his own land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  029" id="11  029" >29</span>
 At the   set   time he shall return, and shall come into the south, but the last   expedition   shall   not   be as the first.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  030" id="11  030" >30</span>
 For the Citians issuing forth shall come against him, and he shall be brought low, and shall return, and shall be incensed against the holy covenant: and he shall do   thus  , and shall return, and have intelligence with them that have forsaken the holy covenant.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  031" id="11  031" >31</span>
 And seeds shall spring up out of him, and they shall profane the sanctuary of strength, and they shall remove the perpetual   sacrifice  , and make the abomination desolate.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  032" id="11  032" >32</span>
 And the transgressors shall bring about a covenant by deceitful ways: but a people knowing their God shall prevail, and do   valiantly  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  033" id="11  033" >33</span>
 And the intelligent of the people shall understand much: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, and by captivity, and by spoil of   many   days.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  034" id="11  034" >34</span>
 And when they are weak they shall be helped with a little help: but many shall attach themselves to them with treachery.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  035" id="11  035" >35</span>
 And   some   of them that understand shall fall, to try them as with fire, and to test   them  , and that they may be manifested at the time of the end, for the matter   is   yet for a   set   time.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  036" id="11  036" >36</span>
 And he shall do according to his will, and the king shall exalt and magnify himself against every god, and shall speak great swelling words, and shall prosper until the indignation shall be accomplished: for it is coming to an end.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  037" id="11  037" >37</span>
 And he shall not regard any gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, neither shall he regard any deity: for he shall magnify himself above all.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  038" id="11  038" >38</span>
 And he shall honor the god of forces on his place: and a god whom his fathers knew not he shall honor with gold, and silver, and precious stones, and desirable things.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  039" id="11  039" >39</span>
 And he shall do   thus   in the strong places of refuge with a strange god, and shall increase his glory: and he shall subject many to them, and shall distribute the land in gifts.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  040" id="11  040" >40</span>
 And at the end of the time he shall conflict with the king of the south: and the king of the north shall come against him with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and they shall enter into the land: and he shall break in pieces, and pass on:  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  041" id="11  041" >41</span>
 and he shall enter into the land of beauty, and many shall fail: but these shall escape out of his hand, Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  042" id="11  042" >42</span>
 And he shall stretch forth   his   hand over the land; and the land of Egypt shall not escape.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  043" id="11  043" >43</span>
 And he shall have the mastery over the secret   treasures   of gold and silver, and over all the desirable   possessions   of Egypt, and of the Libyans and Ethiopians in their strongholds.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  044" id="11  044" >44</span>
 But rumors and anxieties out of the east and from the north shall trouble him; and he shall come with great wrath to destroy many.  <span class="verse" rel="v02711  045" id="11  045" >45</span>
 And he shall pitch the tabernacle of his palace between the seas in the holy mountain of beauty:   but   he shall come to his portion, and there is none to deliver him.

<p><span class="chapter" id="12  001">12  </span> And at that time Michael the great prince shall stand up, that stands over the children of your people: and there shall be a time of tribulation, such tribulation as has not been from the time that there was a nation on the earth until that time: at that time your people shall be delivered,   even   every one that is written in the book.  <span class="verse" rel="v02712  002" id="12  002" >2</span>
