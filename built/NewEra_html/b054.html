<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">A</span>s I am going to demonstrate a most philosophical proposition, namely, that religious reasoning is absolute master of the passions, I would willingly advise you to give the utmost heed to philosophy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 For reason is necessary to every one as a step to science: and more especially does it embrace the praise of prudence, the highest virtue.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 If, then, reasoning appears to hold the mastery over the passions which stand in the way of temperance, such as gluttony and lust,  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 it surely also and manifestly has the rule over the affections which are contrary to justice, such as malice; and of those which are hindrances to manliness, as wrath, and pain, and fear.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 How, then, is it, perhaps some may say, that reasoning, if it rule the affections, is not also master of forgetfulness and ignorance? They attempt a ridiculous argument.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 For reasoning does not rule over its own affections, but over such as are contrary to justice, and manliness and temperance, and prudence; and yet over these, so as to withstand, without destroying them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 I might prove to you, from many other considerations, that religious reasoning is sole master of the passions;  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 but I shall prove it with the greatest force from the fortitude of Eleazar, and seven brethren, and their mother, who suffered death in defence of virtue.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 For all these, contemning pains even to death, by this contempt, demonstrated that reasoning has command over the passions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 For their virtues, then, it is right that I should commend those men who died with their mother at this time in behalf of rectitude; and for their honors, I may count them happy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 For they, winning admiration not only from men in general, but even from the persecutors, for their manliness and endurance, became the means of the destruction of the tyranny against their nation, having conquered the tyrant by their endurance, so that by them their country was purified.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 But we may now at once enter upon the question, having commenced, as is our wont, with laying down the doctrine, and so proceed to the account of these persons, giving glory to the all wise God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 The question, therefore, is, whether reasoning be absolute master of the passions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 Let us determine, then, What is reasoning? and what passion? and how many forms of the passions? and whether reasoning bears sway over all of these?  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 Reasoning is, then, intellect accompanied by a life of rectitude, putting foremost the consideration of wisdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 And wisdom is a knowledge of divine and human things, and of their causes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 And this is contained in the education of the law; by means of which we learn divine things reverently, and human things profitably.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 And the forms of wisdom are prudence, and justice, and manliness, and temperance.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 The leading one of these is prudence; by whose means, indeed, it is that reasoning bears rule over the passions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 Of the passions, pleasure and pain are the two most comprehensive; and they also by nature refer to the soul.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  021" id="1  021" >21</span>
 And there are many attendant affections surrounding pleasure and pain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  022" id="1  022" >22</span>
 Before pleasure is lust; and after pleasure, joy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  023" id="1  023" >23</span>
 And before pain is fear; and after pain is sorrow.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  024" id="1  024" >24</span>
 Wrath is an affection, common to pleasure and to pain, if any one will pay attention when it comes upon him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  025" id="1  025" >25</span>
 And there exists in pleasure a malicious disposition, which is the most multiform of all the affections.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  026" id="1  026" >26</span>
 In the soul it is arrogance, and love of money, and vaingloriousness, and contention, and faithlessness, and the evil eye.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  027" id="1  027" >27</span>
 In the body it is greediness and gormandizing, and solitary gluttony.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  028" id="1  028" >28</span>
 As pleasure and pain are, therefore, two growth of the body and the soul, so there are many offshoots of these passions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  029" id="1  029" >29</span>
 And reasoning, the universal husbandman, purging, and pruning these severally, and binding round, and watering, and transplanting, in every way improves the materials of the morals and affections.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  030" id="1  030" >30</span>
 For reasoning is the leader of the virtues, but it is the sole ruler of the passions. Observe then first, through the very things which stand in the way of temperance, that reasoning is absolute ruler of the passions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  031" id="1  031" >31</span>
 Now temperance consists of a command over the lusts.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  032" id="1  032" >32</span>
 But of the lusts, some belong to the soul, others to the body: and over each of these classes the reasoning appears to bear sway.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  033" id="1  033" >33</span>
 For whence is it, otherwise, that when urged on to forbidden meats, we reject the gratification which would ensue from them? Is it not because reasoning is able to command the appetites? I believe so.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  034" id="1  034" >34</span>
 Hence it is, then, that when lusting after water-animals and birds, and four-footed beasts, and all kinds of food which are forbidden us by the law, we withhold ourselves through the mastery of reasoning.  <span class="verse" rel="v0541  035" id="1  035" >35</span>
 For the affections of our appetites are resisted by the temperate understanding, and bent back again, and all the impulses of the body are reined in by reasoning.  
<!-- 2   035 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> And what wonder? if the lusts of the soul, after participation with what is beautiful, are frustrated,  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 on this ground, therefore, the temperate Joseph is praised in that by reasoning, he subdued, on reflection, the indulgence of sense.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 For, although young, and ripe for sexual intercourse, he abrogated by reasoning the stimulus of his passions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 And it is not merely the stimulus of sensual indulgence, but that of every desire, that reasoning is able to master.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 For instance, the law says, You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor anything that belongs to your neighbor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 Now, then, since it is the law which has forbidden us to desire, I shall much the more easily persuade you, that reasoning is able to govern our lusts, just as it does the affections which are impediments to justice.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 Since in what way is a solitary eater, and a glutton, and a drunkard reclaimed, unless it be clear that reasoning is lord of the passions?  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 A man, therefore, who regulates his course by the law, even if he be a lover of money, straightway puts force upon his own disposition; lending to the needy without interest, and cancelling the debt of the incoming sabbath.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 And should a man be parsimonious, he is ruled by the law acting through reasoning; so that he does not glean his harvest crops, nor vintage: and in reference to other points we may perceive that it is reasoning that conquers his passions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 For the law conquers even affection toward parents, not surrendering virtue on their account.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 And it prevails over marriage love, condemning it when transgressing law.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 And it lords it over the love of parents toward their children, for they punish them for vice; and it domineers over the intimacy of friends, reproving them when wicked.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 And think it not a strange assertion that reasoning can in behalf of the law conquer even enmity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 It allows not to cut down the cultivated herbage of an enemy, but preserves it from the destroyers, and collects their fallen ruins.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 And reason appears to be master of the more violent passions, as love of empire and empty boasting, and slander.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 For the temperate understanding repels all these malignant passions, as it does wrath: for it masters even this.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 Thus Moses, when angered against Dathan and Abiram, did nothing to them in wrath, but regulated his anger by reasoning.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 For the temperate mind is able, as I said, to be superior to the passions, and to transfer some, and destroy others.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 For why, else, does our most wise father Jacob blame Simeon and Levi for having irrationally slain the whole race of the Shechemites, saying, Cursed be their anger.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 For if reasoning did not possess the power of subduing angry affections, he would not have spoken thus.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 For at the time when God created man, He implanted within him his passions and moral nature.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 And at that time He enthroned above all the holy leader mind, through the medium of the senses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  023" id="2  023" >23</span>
 And He gave a law to this mind, by living according to which it will maintain a temperate, and just, and good, and manly reign.  <span class="verse" rel="v0542  024" id="2  024" >24</span>
 How, then, a man may say, if reasoning be master of the passions, has it no control over forgetfulness and ignorance?  
<!-- 3   024 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> The argument is exceedingly ridiculous: for reasoning does not appear to bear sway over its own affections, but over those of the body,  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 in such a way as that any one of you may not be able to root out desire, but reasoning will enable you to avoid being enslaved to it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 One may not be able to root out anger from the soul, but it is possible to withstand anger.  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 Any one of you may not be able to eradicate malice, but reasoning has force to work with you to prevent you yielding to malice.  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 For reasoning is not an eradicator, but an antagonist of the passions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 And this may be more clearly comprehended from the thirst of king David.  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 For after David had been attacking the Philistines the whole day, he with the soldiers of his nation killed many of them;  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 then when evening came, sweating and very weary, he came to the royal tent, about which the entire host of our ancestors was encamped.  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 Now all the rest of them were at supper;  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 but the king, being very much thirsty, although he had numerous springs, could not by their means quench his thirst;  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 but a certain irrational longing for the water in the enemy's camp grew stronger and fiercer upon him, and consumed him with languish.  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 Therefore his bodyguards being troubled at this longing of the king, two valiant young soldiers, reverencing the desire of the king, put on their panoplies, and taking a pitcher, got over the ramparts of the enemies:  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 and unperceived by the guardians of the gate, they went throughout the whole camp of the enemy in quest.  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 And having boldly discovered the fountain, they filled out of it the draught for the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 But he, though parched with thirst, reasoned that a draught reputed of equal value to blood, would be terribly dangerous to his soul.  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 Therefore, setting up reasoning in opposition to his desire, he poured out the draught to God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 For the temperate mind has power to conquer the pressure of the passions, and to quench the fires of excitement,  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 and to wrestle down the pains of the body, however excessive; and, through the excellency of reasoning, to abominate all the assaults of the passions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  019" id="3  019" >19</span>
 But the occasion now invites us to give an illustration of temperate reasoning from history.  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  020" id="3  020" >20</span>
 For at a time when our fathers were in possession of undisturbed peace through obedience to the law, and were prosperous, so that Seleucus Nicanor, the king of Asia, both assigned them money for divine service, and accepted their form of government,  <span class="verse" rel="v0543  021" id="3  021" >21</span>
 then certain persons, bringing in new things contrary to the general unanimity, in various ways fell into calamities.  
<!-- 4   021 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> For a certain man named Simon, who was in opposition to Onias, who once held the high priesthood for life, and was an honorable and good man, after that by slandering him in every way, he could not injure him with the people, went away as an exile, with the intention of betraying his country.  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 Whence coming to Apollonius, the military governor of Syria, and Phoenicia, and Cilicia, he said,  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 Having good will to the king's affairs, I am come to inform you that infinite private wealth is laid up in the treasuries of Jerusalem which do not belong to the temple, but pertain to king Seleucus.  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 Apollonius, acquainting himself with the particulars of this, praised Simon for his care of the king's interests, and going up to Seleucus informed him of the treasure;  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  005" id="4  005" >5</span>
 and getting authority about it, and quickly advancing into our country with the accursed Simon and a very heavy force,  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 he said that he came with the commands of the king that he should take the private money of the treasure.  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 And the nation, indignant at this proclamation, and replying to the effect that it was extremely unfair that those who had committed deposits to the sacred treasury should be deprived of them, resisted as well as they could.  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 But Appolonius went away with threats into the temple.  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 And the priests, with the women and children, having supplicated God to throw his shield over the holy, despised place,  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 and Appolonius going up with his armed force to the seizure of the treasure, —there appeared from heaven angels riding on horseback, all radiant in armor, filling them with much fear and trembling.  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 And Apollonius fell half dead upon the court which is open to all nations, and extended his hands to heaven, and implored the Hebrews, with tears, to pray for him, and propitiate the heavenly host.  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 For he said that he had sinned, so as to be consequently worthy of death; and that if he were saved, he would celebrate to all men the blessedness of the holy place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 Onias the high priest, induced by these words, although for other reasons anxious that king Seleucus should not suppose that Apollonius was slain by human device and not by Divine punishment, prayed for him;  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  014" id="4  014" >14</span>
 and he being thus unexpectedly saved, departed to manifest to the king what had happened to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  015" id="4  015" >15</span>
 But on the death of Seleucus the king, his son Antiochus Epiphanes succeeds to the kingdom: a man of haughty pride and terrible.  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  016" id="4  016" >16</span>
 Who having deposed Onias from the high priesthood, appointed his brother Jason to be high priest:  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  017" id="4  017" >17</span>
 who had made a covenant, if he would give him this authority, to pay yearly three thousand six hundred and sixty talents.  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  018" id="4  018" >18</span>
 And he committed to him the high priesthood and rulership over the nation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  019" id="4  019" >19</span>
 And he both changed the manner of living of the people, and perverted their civil customs into all lawlessness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  020" id="4  020" >20</span>
 So that he not only erected a gymnasium on the very citadel of our country,   but neglected   the guardianship of the temple.  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  021" id="4  021" >21</span>
 At which Divine vengeance being grieved, instigated Antiochus himself against them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  022" id="4  022" >22</span>
 For being at war with Ptolemy in Egypt, he heard that on a report of his death being spread abroad, the inhabitants of Jerusalem had exceedingly rejoiced, and he quickly marched against them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  023" id="4  023" >23</span>
 And having subdued them, he established a decree that if any of them lived according to the laws of his country he should die.  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  024" id="4  024" >24</span>
 And when he could by no means destroy by his decrees the obedience to the law of the nation, but saw all his threats and punishments without effect,  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  025" id="4  025" >25</span>
 for even women, because they continued to circumcise their children, were flung down a precipice along with them, knowing beforehand of the punishment.  <span class="verse" rel="v0544  026" id="4  026" >26</span>
 When, therefore, his decrees were disregarded by the people, he himself compelled by means of tortures every one of this race, by tasting forbidden meats, to abjure the Jewish religion.  
<!-- 5   026 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> The tyrant Antiochus, therefore, sitting in public state with his assessors upon a certain lofty place, with his armed troops standing in a circle around him,  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 commanded his spearbearers to seize every one of the Hebrews, and to compel them to taste swine's flesh, and things offered to idols.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 And should any of them be unwilling to eat the accursed food, they were to be tortured on the wheel, and so killed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 And when many had been seized, a foremost man of the assembly, a Hebrew, by name Eleazar, a priest by family, by profession a lawyer, and advanced in years, and for this reason known to many of the king's followers, was brought near to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 And Antiochus seeing him, said,  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 I would counsel you, old man, before your tortures begin, to taste the swine's flesh, and save your life; for I feel respect for your age and hoary head, which since you have had so long, you appear to me to be no philosopher in retaining the superstition of the Jews.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 For therefore, since nature has conferred upon you the most excellent flesh of this animal, do you loathe it?  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 It seems senseless not to enjoy what is pleasant, yet not disgraceful; and from notions of sinfulness, to reject the boons of nature.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 And you will be acting, I think, still more senselessly, if you follow vain conceits about the truth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 And you will, moreover, be despising me to your own punishment.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  011" id="5  011" >11</span>
 Will you not awake from your trifling philosophy? and give up the folly of your notions; and, regaining understanding worthy of your age, search into the truth of an expedient course?  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  012" id="5  012" >12</span>
 and, reverencing my kindly admonition, have pity upon your own years?  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  013" id="5  013" >13</span>
 For, bear in mind, that if there be any power which watches over this religion of yours, it will pardon you for all transgressions of the law which you commit through compulsion.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 While the tyrant incited him in this manner to the unlawful eating of flesh, Eleazar begged permission to speak.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  015" id="5  015" >15</span>
 And having received power to speak, he began thus to deliver himself:  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  016" id="5  016" >16</span>
 We, O Antiochus, who are persuaded that we live under a divine law, consider no compulsion to be so forcible as obedience to that law;  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  017" id="5  017" >17</span>
 therefore we consider that we ought not in any point to transgress the law.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  018" id="5  018" >18</span>
 And indeed, were our law (as you suppose) not truly divine, and if we wrongly think it divine, we should have no right even in that case to destroy our sense of religion.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  019" id="5  019" >19</span>
 think not eating the unclean, then, a trifling offense.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  020" id="5  020" >20</span>
 For transgression of the law, whether in small or great matters, is of equal moment;  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  021" id="5  021" >21</span>
 for in either case the law is equally slighted.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  022" id="5  022" >22</span>
 But you deride our philosophy, as though we lived irrationally in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  023" id="5  023" >23</span>
 Yet it instructs us in temperance, so that we are superior to all pleasures and lusts; and it exercises us in manliness, so that we cheerfully undergo every grievance.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  024" id="5  024" >24</span>
 And it instructs us in justice, so that in all our dealings we render what is due; and it teaches us piety, so that we worship the one only God becomingly.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  025" id="5  025" >25</span>
 Therefore it is that we eat not the unclean; for believing that the law was established by God, we are convinced that the Creator of the world, in giving his laws, sympathizes with our nature.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  026" id="5  026" >26</span>
 Those things which are convenient to our souls, he has directed us to eat; but those which are repugnant to them, he has interdicted.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  027" id="5  027" >27</span>
 But, tyrant-like, you not only force us to break the law, but also to eat, that you may ridicule us as we thus profanely eat:  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  028" id="5  028" >28</span>
 but you shall not have this cause of laughter against me;  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  029" id="5  029" >29</span>
 nor will I transgress the sacred oaths of my forefathers to keep the law.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  030" id="5  030" >30</span>
 No, not if you pluck out my eyes, and consume my entrails.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  031" id="5  031" >31</span>
 I am not so old, and void of manliness, but that my rational powers are youthful in defence of my religion.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  032" id="5  032" >32</span>
 Now then; prepare your wheels, and kindle a fiercer flame.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  033" id="5  033" >33</span>
 I will not so compassionate my old age, as on my account to break the law of my country.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  034" id="5  034" >34</span>
 I will not belie you, O law, my instructor! or forsake you, O beloved self-control!  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  035" id="5  035" >35</span>
 I will not put you to shame, O philosopher Reason; or deny you, O honored priesthood, and science of the law.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  036" id="5  036" >36</span>
 Mouth! you shall not pollute my old age, nor the full stature of a perfect life.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  037" id="5  037" >37</span>
 My fathers shall receive me pure, not having quailed before your compulsion, though to death.  <span class="verse" rel="v0545  038" id="5  038" >38</span>
 For over the ungodly you shall tyrannize; but you shall not lord it over my thoughts about religion, either by your arguments, or through deeds.  
<!-- 6   038 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="6  001">6  </span> When Eleazar had in this manner answered the exhortations of the tyrant, the spearbearers came up, and rudely haled Eleazar to the instruments of torture.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  002" id="6  002" >2</span>
 And first, they stripped the old man, adorned as he was with the comeliness of piety.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  003" id="6  003" >3</span>
 Then tying back his arms and hands, they disdainfully used him with stripes;  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  004" id="6  004" >4</span>
 a herald opposite crying out, Obey the commands of the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  005" id="6  005" >5</span>
 But Eleazar, the high-minded and truly noble, as one tortured in a dream, regarded it not all.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  006" id="6  006" >6</span>
 But raising his eyes on high to heaven, the old man's flesh was stripped off by the scourges, and his blood streamed down, and his sides were pierced through.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  007" id="6  007" >7</span>
 And falling upon the ground, from his body having no power to support the pains, he yet kept his reasoning upright and unbending.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  008" id="6  008" >8</span>
 then one of the harsh spearbearers leaped upon his belly as he was falling, to force him upright.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  009" id="6  009" >9</span>
 But he endured the pains, and despised the cruelty, and persevered through the indignities;  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  010" id="6  010" >10</span>
 and like a noble athlete, the old man, when struck, vanquished his torturers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  011" id="6  011" >11</span>
 His countenance sweating, and he panting for breath, he was admired by the very torturers for his courage.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  012" id="6  012" >12</span>
 Therefore, partly in pity for his old age,  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  013" id="6  013" >13</span>
 partly from the sympathy of acquaintance, and partly in admiration of his endurance, some of the attendants of the king said,  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  014" id="6  014" >14</span>
 Why do you unreasonably destroy yourself, O Eleazar, with these miseries?  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  015" id="6  015" >15</span>
 We will bring you some meat cooked by yourself, and do you save yourself by pretending that you have eaten swine's flesh.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  016" id="6  016" >16</span>
 And Eleazar, as though the advice more painfully tortured him, cried out,  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  017" id="6  017" >17</span>
 Let not us who are children of Abraham be so evil advised as by giving way to make use of an unbecoming pretense;  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  018" id="6  018" >18</span>
 for it were irrational, if having lived up to old age in all truth, and having scrupulously guarded our character for it, we should now turn back,  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  019" id="6  019" >19</span>
 and ourselves should become a pattern of impiety to the young, as being an example of pollution eating.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  020" id="6  020" >20</span>
 It would be disgraceful if we should live on some short time, and that scorned by all men for cowardice,  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  021" id="6  021" >21</span>
 and be condemned by the tyrant for unmanliness, by not contending to the death for our divine law.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  022" id="6  022" >22</span>
 Therefore do you, O children of Abraham, die nobly for your religion.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  023" id="6  023" >23</span>
 You° spearbearers of the tyrant, why do you° linger?  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  024" id="6  024" >24</span>
 Beholding him so high-minded against misery, and not changing at their pity, they led him to the fire:  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  025" id="6  025" >25</span>
 then with their wickedly contrived instruments they burnt him on the fire, and poured stinking fluids down into his nostrils.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  026" id="6  026" >26</span>
 And he being at length burnt down to the bones, and about to expire, raised his eyes Godward, and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  027" id="6  027" >27</span>
 You know, O God, that when I might have been saved, I am slain for the sake of the law by tortures of fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  028" id="6  028" >28</span>
 Be merciful to your people, and be satisfied with the punishment of me on their account.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  029" id="6  029" >29</span>
 Let my blood be a purification for them, and take my life in recompense for theirs.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  030" id="6  030" >30</span>
 Thus speaking, the holy man departed, noble in his torments, and even to the agonies of death resisted in his reasoning for the sake of the law.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  031" id="6  031" >31</span>
 Confessedly, therefore, religious reasoning is master of the passions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  032" id="6  032" >32</span>
 For had the passions been superior to reasoning, I would have given them the witness of this mastery.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  033" id="6  033" >33</span>
 But now, since reasoning conquered the passions, we befittingly awared it the authority of first place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  034" id="6  034" >34</span>
 And it is but fair that we should allow, that the power belongs to reasoning, since it masters external miseries.  <span class="verse" rel="v0546  035" id="6  035" >35</span>
 Ridiculous would it be were it not so; and I prove that reasoning has not only mastered pains, but that it is also superior to the pleasures, and withstands them.  
<!-- 7   035 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="7  001">7  </span> The reasoning of our father Eleazar, like a first-rate pilot, steering the vessel of piety in the sea of passions,  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  002" id="7  002" >2</span>
 and flouted by the threats of the tyrant, and overwhelmed with the breakers of torture,  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  003" id="7  003" >3</span>
 in no way shifted the rudder of piety till it sailed into the harbour of victory over death.  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  004" id="7  004" >4</span>
 Not so has ever a city, when besieged, held out against many and various machines, as did that holy man, when his pious soul was tried with the fiery trial of tortures and rackings, move his besiegers through the religious reasoning that shielded him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  005" id="7  005" >5</span>
 For father Eleazar, projecting his disposition, broke the raging waves of the passions as with a jutting promontory.  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  006" id="7  006" >6</span>
 O priest worthy of the priesthood! you did not pollute your sacred teeth; nor make your appetite, which had always embraced the clean and lawful, a partaker of profanity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  007" id="7  007" >7</span>
 O harmonizer with the law, and sage devoted to a divine life!  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  008" id="7  008" >8</span>
 Of such a character ought those to be who perform the duties of the law at the risk of their own blood, and defend it with generous sweat by sufferings even to death.  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  009" id="7  009" >9</span>
 You, father, have gloriously established our right government by your endurance; and making of much account our service past, prevented its destruction, and, by your deeds, have made credible the words of philosophy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  010" id="7  010" >10</span>
 O aged man of more power than tortures, elder more vigorous than fire, greatest king over the passions, Eleazar!  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  011" id="7  011" >11</span>
 For as father Aaron, armed with a censer, hastening through the consuming fire, vanquished the flame-bearing angel,  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  012" id="7  012" >12</span>
 so, Eleazar, the descendant of Aaron, wasted away by the fire, did not give up his reasoning.  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  013" id="7  013" >13</span>
 And, what is most wonderful, though an old man, though the labors of his body were now spent, and his fibres were relaxed, and his sinews worn out, he recovered youth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  014" id="7  014" >14</span>
 By the spirit of reasoning, and the reasoning of Isaac, he rendered powerless the many-headed instrument.  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  015" id="7  015" >15</span>
 O blessed old age, and reverend hoar head, and life obedient to the law, which the faithful seal of death perfected.  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  016" id="7  016" >16</span>
 If, then, an old man, through religion, despised tortures even to death, confessedly religious reasoning is ruler of the passions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  017" id="7  017" >17</span>
 But perhaps some might say, It is not all who conquer passions, as all do not possess wise reasoning.  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  018" id="7  018" >18</span>
 But they who have meditated upon religion with their whole heart, these alone can master the passions of the flesh;  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  019" id="7  019" >19</span>
 they who believe that to God they die not; for, as our forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, they live to God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  020" id="7  020" >20</span>
 This circumstance, then, is by no means an objection, that some who have weak reasoning, are governed by their passions:  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  021" id="7  021" >21</span>
 since what person, walking religiously by the whole rule of philosophy, and believing in God,  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  022" id="7  022" >22</span>
 and knowing that it is a blessed thing to endure all kinds of hardships for virtue, would not, for the sake of religion, master his passion?  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  023" id="7  023" >23</span>
 For the wise and brave man only is lord over his passions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  024" id="7  024" >24</span>
 Whence it is, that even boys, imbued with the philosophy of religious reasoning, have conquered still more bitter tortures:  <span class="verse" rel="v0547  025" id="7  025" >25</span>
 for when the tyrant was manifestly vanquished in his first attempt, in being unable to force the old man to eat the unclean thing,-  
<!-- 8   025 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> Then, indeed, vehemently swayed with passion, he commanded to bring others of the adult Hebrews, and if they would eat of the unclean thing, to let them go when they had eaten; but if they objected, to torment them more grievously.  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 The tyrant having given this charge, seven brethren were brought into his presence, along with their aged mother, handsome, and modest, and well-born, and altogether comely.  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 Whom, when the tyrant [*]saw, encircling their mother as in a dance, he was pleased at them; and being struck with their becoming and ingenuous mien, smiled upon them, and calling them near, said:  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  004" id="8  004" >4</span>
 O youths, with favourable feelings, I admire the beauty of each of you; and greatly honouring so numerous a band of brethren, I not only counsel you not to share the madness of the old man who has been tortured before,  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 but I do beg you to yield, and to enjoy my friendship; for I possess the power, not only of punishing those who disobey my commands, but of doing good to those who obey them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 Put confidence in me, then, and you shall receive places of authority in my government, if you forsake your national ordinance,  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  007" id="8  007" >7</span>
 and, conforming to the Greek mode of life, alter your rule, and revel in youth's delights.  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  008" id="8  008" >8</span>
 For if you provoke me by your disobedience, you will compel me to destroy you, every one, with terrible punishments by tortures.  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 Have mercy, then, upon your own selves, whom I, although an enemy, compassionate for your age and comeliness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 Will you not reason upon this—that if you disobey, there will be nothing left for you but to die in tortures?  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  011" id="8  011" >11</span>
 Thus speaking, he ordered the instruments of torture to be brought forward, that very fear might prevail upon them to eat unclean meat.  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  012" id="8  012" >12</span>
 And when the spearman brought forward the wheels, and the racks, and the hooks, and catapults, and caldrons, pans, and finger-racks, and iron hands and wedges, and bellows, the tyrant continue:  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 Fear, young men, and the righteousness which you° worship will be merciful to you if you err from compulsion.  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 Now they having listened to these words of persuasion, and seeing the fearful instruments, not only were not afraid, but even answered the arguments of the tyrant, and through their good reasoning destroyed his power.  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  015" id="8  015" >15</span>
 Now let us consider the matter: had any of them been weak-spirited and cowardly among them, what reasonings would they have employed but these?  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  016" id="8  016" >16</span>
 O wretched that we are, and exceeding senseless! when the king exhorts us, and calls us to his bounty, should we not obey him?  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  017" id="8  017" >17</span>
 Why do we cheer ourselves with vain counsels, and venture upon a disobedience bringing death?  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  018" id="8  018" >18</span>
 Shall we not fear, O brethren, the instruments of torture and weigh the threatenings of torment and shun this vain-glory and destructive pride?  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  019" id="8  019" >19</span>
 Let us have compassion upon our age and relent over the years of our mother.  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  020" id="8  020" >20</span>
 And let us bear in mind that we shall be dying as rebels.  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  021" id="8  021" >21</span>
 And Divine Justice will pardon us if we fear the king through necessity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  022" id="8  022" >22</span>
 Why withdraw ourselves from a most sweet life, and deprive ourselves of this pleasant world?  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  023" id="8  023" >23</span>
 Let us not oppose necessity, nor seek vain-glory by our own excruciation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  024" id="8  024" >24</span>
 The law itself is not forward to put us to death, if we dread torture.  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  025" id="8  025" >25</span>
 Whence has such angry zeal taken root in us, and such fatal obstinacy approved itself to us, when we might live unmolested by the king?  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  026" id="8  026" >26</span>
 But nothing of this kind did the young men say or think when about to be tortured.  <span class="verse" rel="v0548  027" id="8  027" >27</span>
 For they were well aware of the sufferings, and masters of the pains. So that as soon as the tyrant had ceased counselling them to eat the unclean, they altogether with one voice, as from the same heart said:  
<!-- 9   027 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="9  001">9  </span> Why delay you, O tyrant? for we are readier to die than to transgress the injunctions of our fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  002" id="9  002" >2</span>
 And we should be disgracing our fathers if we did not obey the law, and take knowledge for our guide.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  003" id="9  003" >3</span>
 O tyrant, counsellor of law-breaking, do not, hating us as you do, pity us more than we pity ourselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  004" id="9  004" >4</span>
 For we account escape to be worse than death.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  005" id="9  005" >5</span>
 And you think to scare us, by threatening us with death by tortures, as though you had learned nothing by the death of Eleazar.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
 But if aged men of the Hebrews have died in the cause of religion after enduring torture, more rightly should we younger men die, scorning your cruel tortures, which our aged instructor overcame.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 Make the attempt, then, O tyrant; and if you put us to death for our religion, think not that you harm us by torturing us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 For we through this ill-treatment and endurance shall bear off the rewards of virtue.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 But you, for the wicked and despotic slaughter of us, shall, from the Divine vengeance, endure eternal torture by fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  010" id="9  010" >10</span>
 When they had thus spoken, the tyrant was not only exasperated against them as being refractory, but enraged with them as being ungrateful.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  011" id="9  011" >11</span>
 So that, at his bidding, the torturers brought forth the oldest of them, and tearing through his tunic, bound his hands and arms on each side with thongs.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  012" id="9  012" >12</span>
 And when they had laboured hard without effect in scourging him, they hurled him upon the wheel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  013" id="9  013" >13</span>
 And the noble youth, extended upon this, became dislocated.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  014" id="9  014" >14</span>
 And with every member disjointed, he exclaimed in expostulation,  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  015" id="9  015" >15</span>
 O most accursed tyrant, and enemy of heavenly justice, and cruel-hearted, I am no murderer, nor sacrilegious man, whom you thus ill-usest; but a defender of the Divine law.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  016" id="9  016" >16</span>
 And when the spearmen said, Consent to eat, that you may be released from your tortures,—  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  017" id="9  017" >17</span>
 he answered, Not so powerful, O accursed ministers, is your wheel, as to stifle my reasoning; cut my limbs, and burn my flesh, and twist my joints.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  018" id="9  018" >18</span>
 For through all my torments I will convince you that the children of the Hebrews are alone unconquered in behalf of virtue.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  019" id="9  019" >19</span>
 While he was saying this, they heaped up fuel, and setting fire to it, strained him upon the wheel still more.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  020" id="9  020" >20</span>
 And the wheel was defiled all over with blood, and the hot ashes were quenched by the droppings of gore, and pieces of flesh were scattered about the axles of the machine.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  021" id="9  021" >21</span>
 And although the framework of his bones was now destroyed the high-minded and Abrahamic youth did not groan.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  022" id="9  022" >22</span>
 But, as though transformed by fire into immortality, he nobly endured the rackings, saying  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  023" id="9  023" >23</span>
 Imitate me, O brethren, nor ever desert your station, nor abjure my brotherhood in courage: fight the holy and honorable fight of religion;  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  024" id="9  024" >24</span>
 by which means our just and paternal Providence, becoming merciful to the nation, will punish the pestilent tyrant.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  025" id="9  025" >25</span>
 And saying this, the revered youth abruptly closed his life.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  026" id="9  026" >26</span>
 And when all admired his courageous soul, the spearmen brought forward him who was second in point of age, and having put on iron hands, bound him with pointed hooks to the catapelt.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  027" id="9  027" >27</span>
 And when, on enquiring whether he would eat before he was tortured, they heard his noble sentiment,  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  028" id="9  028" >28</span>
 after they with the iron hands had violently dragged all the flesh from the neck to the chin, the panther-like beasts tore off the very skin of his head: but he, bearing with firmness this misery, said,  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  029" id="9  029" >29</span>
 How sweet is every form of death for the religion of our fathers! and he said to the tyrant,  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  030" id="9  030" >30</span>
 Thinkest you not, most cruel of all tyrants, that you are now tortured more than I, finding your overweening conception of tyranny conquered by our patience in behalf of our religion?  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  031" id="9  031" >31</span>
 For I lighten my suffering by the pleasures which are connected with virtue.  <span class="verse" rel="v0549  032" id="9  032" >32</span>
 But you are tortured with threatenings for impiety; and you shall not escape, most corrupt tyrant, the vengeance of Divine wrath.  
<!-- 10   032 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="10  001">10  </span> Now this one, having endured this praiseworthy death, the third was brought along, and exhorted by many to taste and save his life.  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  002" id="10  002" >2</span>
 But he cried out and said, Know you° not, that the father of those who are dead, became the father of me also; and that the same mother bare me; and that I was brought up in the same tenets?  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  003" id="10  003" >3</span>
 I abjure not the noble relationship of my brethren.  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  004" id="10  004" >4</span>
 Now then, whatever instrument of vengeance you° have, apply it to my body, for you° are not able to touch, even if you° wish it, my soul.  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  005" id="10  005" >5</span>
 But they, highly incensed at his boldness of speech, dislocated his hands and feet with racking engines, and wrenching them from their sockets, dismembered him.  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  006" id="10  006" >6</span>
 And they dragged round his fingers, and his arms, and his legs, and his ankles.  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  007" id="10  007" >7</span>
 And not being able by any means to strangle him, they tore off his skin, together with the extreme tips of his fingers, flayed him, and then haled him to the wheel;  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  008" id="10  008" >8</span>
 around which his vertebral joints were loosened, and he saw his own flesh torn to shreds, and streams of blood flowing from his entrails.  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  009" id="10  009" >9</span>
 And when about to die, he said,  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  010" id="10  010" >10</span>
 We, O accursed tyrant, suffer this for the sake of Divine education and virtue.  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  011" id="10  011" >11</span>
 But you, for your impiety and blood shedding, shall endure indissoluble torments.  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  012" id="10  012" >12</span>
 And thus having died worthily of his brethren, they dragged forward the fourth, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  013" id="10  013" >13</span>
 Do not you share the madness of your brethren: but give regard to the king, and save yourself.  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  014" id="10  014" >14</span>
 But he said to them, You have not a fire so scorching as to make me play the coward.  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  015" id="10  015" >15</span>
 By the blessed death of my brethren, and the eternal punishment of the tyrant, and the glorious life of the pious, I will not repudiate the noble brotherhood.  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  016" id="10  016" >16</span>
 Invent, O tyrant, tortures; that you may learn, even through them, that I am the brother of those tormented before.  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  017" id="10  017" >17</span>
 When he had said this, the blood-thirsty, and murderous, and unhallowed Antiochus ordered his tongue to be cut out.  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  018" id="10  018" >18</span>
 But he said, Even if you take away the organ of speech, yet God hears the silent.  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  019" id="10  019" >19</span>
 Behold, my tongue is extended, cut it off; for not for that halt you extirpate our reasoning.  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  020" id="10  020" >20</span>
 Gladly do we lose our limbs in behalf of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v05410  021" id="10  021" >21</span>
 But God shall speedly find you, since you cut off the tongue, the instrument of divine melody.  
<!-- 11   021 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="11  001">11  </span> And when he had died, disfigured in his torments, the fifth leaped forward, and said,  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  002" id="11  002" >2</span>
 I intend not, O tyrant, to get excused from the torment which is in behalf of virtue.  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  003" id="11  003" >3</span>
 But I have come of my own accord, that by the death of me, you may owe heavenly vengeance a punishment for more crimes.  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  004" id="11  004" >4</span>
 O you hater of virtue and of men, what have we done that you thus revel in our blood?  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  005" id="11  005" >5</span>
 Does it seem evil to you that we worship the Founder of all things, and live according to his surpassing law?  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  006" id="11  006" >6</span>
 But this is worthy of honors, not torments;  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  007" id="11  007" >7</span>
 had you been capable of the higher feelings of men, and possessed the hope of salvation from God.  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  008" id="11  008" >8</span>
 Behold now, being alien from God, you make war against those who are religious toward God.  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  009" id="11  009" >9</span>
 As he said this, the spearbearers bound him, and drew him to the catapelt:  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  010" id="11  010" >10</span>
 to which binding him at his knees, and fastening them with iron fetters, they bent down his loins upon the wedge of the wheel; and his body was then dismembered, scorpion-fashion.  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  011" id="11  011" >11</span>
 With his breath thus confined, and his body strangled, he said,  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  012" id="11  012" >12</span>
 A great favor you bestow upon us, O tyrant, by enabling us to manifest our adherence to the law by means of nobler sufferings.  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  013" id="11  013" >13</span>
 He also being dead, the sixth, quite a youth, was brought out; and on the tyrant asking him whether he would eat and be delivered, he said,  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  014" id="11  014" >14</span>
 I am indeed younger than my brothers, but in understanding I am as old;  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  015" id="11  015" >15</span>
 for having been born and reared to the same end, we are bound to die also in behalf of the same cause.  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  016" id="11  016" >16</span>
 So that if you° think proper to torment us for not eating the unclean;—torment!  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  017" id="11  017" >17</span>
 As he said this, they brought him to the wheel.  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  018" id="11  018" >18</span>
 Extended upon which, with limbs racked and dislocated, he was gradually roasted from beneath.  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  019" id="11  019" >19</span>
 And having heated sharp spits, they approached them to his back; and having transfixed his sides, they burned away his entrails.  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  020" id="11  020" >20</span>
 And he, while tormented, said, O period good and holy, in which, for the sake of religion, we brethren have been called to the contest of pain, and have not been conquered.  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  021" id="11  021" >21</span>
 For religious understanding, O tyrant, is unconquered.  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  022" id="11  022" >22</span>
 Armed with upright virtue, I also shall depart with my brethren.  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  023" id="11  023" >23</span>
 I, too, bearing with me a great avenger, O deviser of tortures, and enemy of the truly pious.  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  024" id="11  024" >24</span>
 We six youths have destroyed your tyranny.  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  025" id="11  025" >25</span>
 For is not your inability to overrule our reasoning, and to compel us to eat the unclean, your destruction?  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  026" id="11  026" >26</span>
 Your fire is cold to us, your catapelts are painless, and your violence harmless.  <span class="verse" rel="v05411  027" id="11  027" >27</span>
 For the guards not of a tyrant but of a divine law are our defenders: through this we keep our reasoning unconquered.

<p><span class="chapter" id="12  001">12  </span> When he, too, had undergone blessed martyrdom, and died in the caldron into which he had been thrown, the seventh, the youngest of all, came forward:  <span class="verse" rel="v05412  002" id="12  002" >2</span>
 whom the tyrant pitying, though he had been dreadfully reproached by his brethren,  <span class="verse" rel="v05412  003" id="12  003" >3</span>
 seeing him already encompassed with chains, had him brought nearer, and endeavoured to counsel him, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v05412  004" id="12  004" >4</span>
 You see the end of the madness of your brethren: for they have died in torture through disobedience; and you, if disobedient, having been miserably tormented, will yourself perish prematurely.  <span class="verse" rel="v05412  005" id="12  005" >5</span>
 But if you obey, you shall be my friend, and have a charge over the affairs of the kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v05412  006" id="12  006" >6</span>
 And having thus exhorted him, he sent for the mother of the boy; that, by condoling with her for the loss of so many sons, he might incline her, through the hope of safety, to render the survivor obedient.  <span class="verse" rel="v05412  007" id="12  007" >7</span>
 And he, after his mother had urged him on in the Hebrew tongue, (as we shall soon relate) says,  <span class="verse" rel="v05412  008" id="12  008" >8</span>
 Release me that I may speak to the king and all his friends.  <span class="verse" rel="v05412  009" id="12  009" >9</span>
 And they, rejoicing exceedingly at the promise of the youth, quickly let him go.  <span class="verse" rel="v05412  010" id="12  010" >10</span>
 And he, running up to the pans, said,  <span class="verse" rel="v05412  011" id="12  011" >11</span>
 Impious tyrant, and most blasphemous man, were you not ashamed, having received prosperity and a kingdom from God, to kill His servants, and to rack the doers of godliness?  <span class="verse" rel="v05412  012" id="12  012" >12</span>
 Therefore the divine vengeance is reserving you for eternal fire and torments, which shall cling to you for all time.  <span class="verse" rel="v05412  013" id="12  013" >13</span>
 Were you not ashamed, man as you are, yet most savage, to cut out the tongues of men of like feeling and origin, and having thus abused to torture them?  <span class="verse" rel="v05412  014" id="12  014" >14</span>
 But they, bravely dying, fulfilled their religion towards God.  <span class="verse" rel="v05412  015" id="12  015" >15</span>
 But you shall groan according to your deserts for having slain without cause the champions of virtue.  <span class="verse" rel="v05412  016" id="12  016" >16</span>
 Therefore, he continued, I myself, being about to die,  <span class="verse" rel="v05412  017" id="12  017" >17</span>
 will not forsake my brethren.  <span class="verse" rel="v05412  018" id="12  018" >18</span>
 And I call upon the God of my fathers to be merciful to my race.  <span class="verse" rel="v05412  019" id="12  019" >19</span>
 But you, both living and dead, he will punish.  <span class="verse" rel="v05412  020" id="12  020" >20</span>
 Thus having prayed, he hurled himself into the pans; and so expired.

<p><span class="chapter" id="13  001">13  </span> If then, the seven brethren despised troubles even to death, it is confessed on all sides that righteous reasoning is absolute master over the passions.  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  002" id="13  002" >2</span>
 For just as if, had they as slaves to the passions, eaten of the unholy, we should have said that they had been conquered by the;  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  003" id="13  003" >3</span>
 now it is not so: but by means of the reasoning which is praised by God, they mastered their passions.  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  004" id="13  004" >4</span>
 And it is impossible to overlook the leadership of reflection: for it gained the victory over both passions and troubles.  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  005" id="13  005" >5</span>
 How, then, can we avoid according to these men mastery of passion through right reasoning, since they drew not back from the pains of fire?  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  006" id="13  006" >6</span>

 so that seven-towered right-reasoning of the young men, securing the harbour of religion, conquered the intermperance of passions.  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  008" id="13  008" >8</span>
 For having arranged a holy choir of piety, they encouraged one another, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  009" id="13  009" >9</span>
 Brothers, may we die brotherly for the law. Let us imitate the three young men in Assyria who despised the equally afflicting furnace.  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  010" id="13  010" >10</span>
 Let us not be cowards in the manifestation of piety.  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  011" id="13  011" >11</span>
 And one said, Courage, brother; and another, Nobly endure.  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  012" id="13  012" >12</span>
 And another, Remember of what stock you° are; and by the hand of our father Isaac endured to be slain for the sake of piety.  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  013" id="13  013" >13</span>
 And one and all, looking on each other serene and confident, said, Let us sacrifice with all our heart our souls to God who gave them, and employ our bodies for the keeping of the law.  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  014" id="13  014" >14</span>
 Let us not fear him who thinks he kills;  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  015" id="13  015" >15</span>
 for great is the trial of soul and danger of eternal torment laid up for those who transgress the commandment of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  016" id="13  016" >16</span>
 Let us arm ourselves, therefore, in the abnegation of the divine reasoning.  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  017" id="13  017" >17</span>
 If we suffer thus, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob will receive us, and all the fathers will commend us.  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  018" id="13  018" >18</span>
 And as each one of the brethren was haled away, the rest exclaimed, Disgrace us not, O brother, nor falsify those who died before you.  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  019" id="13  019" >19</span>
 Now you are not ignorant of the charm of brotherhood, which the Divine and all wise Providence has imparted through fathers to children, and has engendered through the mother's womb.  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  020" id="13  020" >20</span>
 In which these brothers having remained an equal time, and having been formed for the same period, and been increased by the same blood, and having been perfected through the same principle of life,  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  021" id="13  021" >21</span>
 and having been brought forth at equal intervals, and having sucked milk from the same fountains, hence their brotherly souls are reared up lovingly together;  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  022" id="13  022" >22</span>
 and increase the more powerfully by reason of this simultaneous rearing, and by daily intercourse, and by other education, and exercise in the law of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  023" id="13  023" >23</span>
 Brotherly love being thus sympathetically constituted, the seven brethren had a more sympathetic mutual harmony.  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  024" id="13  024" >24</span>
 For being educated in the same law, and practising the same virtues, and reared up in a just course of life, they increased this harmony with each other.  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  025" id="13  025" >25</span>
 For a like ardour for what is right and honorable increased their fellow-feeling towards each other.  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  026" id="13  026" >26</span>
 For it acting along with religion, made their brotherly feeling more desirable to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v05413  027" id="13  027" >27</span>
 And yet, although nature and intercourse and virtuous morals increased their brotherly love those who were left endured to behold their brethren, who were ill-used for their religion, tortured even to death.  
<!-- 14   027 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="14  001">14  </span> And more that this, they even urged them on to this ill-treatment; so that they not only despised pains themselves, but they even got the better of their affections of brotherly love.  <span class="verse" rel="v05414  002" id="14  002" >2</span>
 O reasonings more royal than a king, and freer than freemen!  <span class="verse" rel="v05414  003" id="14  003" >3</span>
 Sacred and harmonious concert of the seven brethren as concerning piety!  <span class="verse" rel="v05414  004" id="14  004" >4</span>
 None of the seven youths turned cowardly, or shrank back from death.  <span class="verse" rel="v05414  005" id="14  005" >5</span>
 But all of them, as though running the road to immortality, hastened on to death through tortures.  <span class="verse" rel="v05414  006" id="14  006" >6</span>
 For just as hands and feet are moved sympathetically with the directions of the soul, so those holy youths agreed to death for religion's sake, as through the immortal soul of religion.  <span class="verse" rel="v05414  007" id="14  007" >7</span>
 O holy seven of harmonious brethren! for as the seven days of creation, about religion,  <span class="verse" rel="v05414  008" id="14  008" >8</span>
 so the youths, circling around the number seven, annulled the fear of torments.  <span class="verse" rel="v05414  009" id="14  009" >9</span>
 We now shudder at the recital of the affliction of those young men; but they not only [*]saw, and not only heard the immediate execution of the threat, but undergoing it, persevered; and that through the pains of fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v05414  010" id="14  010" >10</span>
 And what could be more painful? for the power of fire, being sharp and quick, speedily dissolved their bodies.  <span class="verse" rel="v05414  011" id="14  011" >11</span>
 And think it not wonderful that reasoning bore rule over those men in their torments, when even a woman's mind despised more manifold pains.  <span class="verse" rel="v05414  012" id="14  012" >12</span>
 For the mother of those seven youths endured the rackings of each of her children.  <span class="verse" rel="v05414  013" id="14  013" >13</span>
 And consider how comprehensive is the love of offspring, which draws every one to sympathy of affection,  <span class="verse" rel="v05414  014" id="14  014" >14</span>
 where irrational animals possess a similar sympathy and love for their offspring with men.  <span class="verse" rel="v05414  015" id="14  015" >15</span>
 The tame birds frequenting the roofs of our houses, defend their fledglings.  <span class="verse" rel="v05414  016" id="14  016" >16</span>
 Others build their nests, and hatch their young, in the tops of mountains and in the precipices of valleys, and the holes and tops of trees, and keep off the intruder.  <span class="verse" rel="v05414  017" id="14  017" >17</span>
 And if not able to do this, they fly circling round them in agony of affection, calling out in their own note, and save their offspring in whatever manner they are able.  <span class="verse" rel="v05414  018" id="14  018" >18</span>
 But why should we point attention to the sympathy toward children shown by irrational animals?  <span class="verse" rel="v05414  019" id="14  019" >19</span>
 The very bees, at the season of honey-making, attack all who approach; and pierce with their sting, as with a sword, those who draw near their hive, and repel them even to death.  <span class="verse" rel="v05414  020" id="14  020" >20</span>
 But sympathy with her children did not turn aside the mother of the young men, who had a spirit kindred with that of Abraham.

<p><span class="chapter" id="15  001">15  </span> O reasoning of the sons, lord over the passions, and religion more desirable to a mother than progeny!  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  002" id="15  002" >2</span>
 The mother, when two things were set before here, religion and the safety of her seven sons for a time, on the conditional promise of a tyrant,  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  003" id="15  003" >3</span>
 rather elected the religion which according to God preserves to eternal life.  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  004" id="15  004" >4</span>
 O in what way can I describe ethically the affections of parents toward their children, the resemblance of soul and of form engrafted into the small type of a child in a wonderful manner, especially through the greater sympathy of mothers with the feelings of those born of them!  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  005" id="15  005" >5</span>
 for by how much mothers are by nature weak in disposition and prolific in offspring, by so much the fonder they are of children.  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  006" id="15  006" >6</span>
 And of all mothers the mother of the seven was the fondest of children, who in seven childbirths had deeply engendered love toward them;  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  007" id="15  007" >7</span>
 and through her many pains undergone in connection with each one, was compelled to feel sympathy with them;  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  008" id="15  008" >8</span>
 yet, through fear of God, she neglected the temporary salvation of her children.  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  009" id="15  009" >9</span>
 Not but that, on account of the excellent disposition to the law, her maternal affection toward them was increased.  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  010" id="15  010" >10</span>
 For they were both just and temperate, and manly, and high-minded, and fond of their brethren, and so fond of their mother that even to death they obeyed her by observing the law.  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  011" id="15  011" >11</span>
 And yet, though there were so many circumstances connected with love of children to draw on a mother to sympathy, in the case of none of them were the various tortures able to pervert her principle.  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  012" id="15  012" >12</span>
 But she inclined each one separately and all together to death for religion.  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  013" id="15  013" >13</span>
 O holy nature and parental feeling, and reward of bringing up children, and unconquerable maternal affection!  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  014" id="15  014" >14</span>
 At the racking and roasting of each one of them, the observant mother was prevented by religion from changing.  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  015" id="15  015" >15</span>
 She [*]saw her children's flesh dissolving around the fire; and their extremities quivering on the ground, and the flesh of their heads dropped forwards down to their beards, like masks.  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  016" id="15  016" >16</span>
 O you mother, who was tried at this time with bitterer pangs than those of parturition!  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  017" id="15  017" >17</span>
 O you only woman who have brought forth perfect holiness!  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  018" id="15  018" >18</span>
 Your firstborn, expiring, turned you not; nor the second, looking miserable in his torments; nor the third, breathing out his soul.  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  019" id="15  019" >19</span>
 Nor when you did behold the eyes of each of them looking sternly upon their tortures, and their nostrils foreboding death, did you weep!  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  020" id="15  020" >20</span>
 When you did see children's flesh heaped upon children's flesh that had been torn off, heads decapitated upon heads, dead falling upon the dead, and a choir of children turned through torture into a burying ground, you lamented not.  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  021" id="15  021" >21</span>
 Not so do siren melodies, or songs of swans, attract the hearers to listening, O voices of children calling upon your mother in the midst of torments!  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  022" id="15  022" >22</span>
 With what and what manner of torments was the mother herself tortured, as her sons were undergoing the wheel and the fires!  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  023" id="15  023" >23</span>
 But religious reasoning, having strengthened her courage in the midst of sufferings, enabled her to forego, for the time, parental love.  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  024" id="15  024" >24</span>
 Although beholding the destruction of seven children, the noble mother, after one embrace, stripped off   her feelings   through faith in God.  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  025" id="15  025" >25</span>
 For just as in a council-room, beholding in her own soul vehement counselors, nature and parentage and love of her children, and the racking of her children,  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  026" id="15  026" >26</span>
 she holding two votes, one for the death, the other for the preservation of her children,  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  027" id="15  027" >27</span>
 did not lean to that which would have saved her children for the safety of a brief space.  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  028" id="15  028" >28</span>
 But this daughter of Abraham remembered his holy fortitude.  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  029" id="15  029" >29</span>
 O holy mother of a nation avenger of the law, and defender of religion, and prime bearer in the battle of the affections!  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  030" id="15  030" >30</span>
 O you nobler in endurance than males, and more manly than men in patience!  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  031" id="15  031" >31</span>
 For as the ark of Noah, bearing the world in the world-filling flood, bore up against the waves,  <span class="verse" rel="v05415  032" id="15  032" >32</span>
 so you, the guardian of the law, when surrounded on every side by the flood of passions, and straitened by violent storms which were the torments of they children, did bear up nobly against the storms against religion.  
<!-- 16   032 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="16  001">16  </span> If, then, even a woman, and that an aged one, and the mother of seven children, endured to see her children's torments even to death, confessedly religious reasoning is master even of the passions.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  002" id="16  002" >2</span>
 I have proved, then, that not only men have obtained the mastery of their passions, but also that a woman despised the greatest torments.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  003" id="16  003" >3</span>
 And not so fierce were the lions round Daniel, nor the furnace of Misael burning with most vehement fires as that natural love of children burned within her, when she [*]saw her seven sons tortured.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  004" id="16  004" >4</span>
 But with the reasoning of religion the mother quenched passions so great and powerful.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  005" id="16  005" >5</span>
 For we must consider also this: that, had the woman been faint hearted, as being their other, she would have lamented over them; and perhaps might have spoken thus:  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  006" id="16  006" >6</span>
 Ah! wretched I, and many times miserable; who having born seven sons, have become the mother of none.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  007" id="16  007" >7</span>
 O seven useless childbirths, and seven profitless periods of labor, and fruitless givings of suck, and miserable nursings at the breast.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  008" id="16  008" >8</span>
 Vainly, for your sakes, O sons, have I endured many pangs, and the more difficult anxieties of rearing.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  009" id="16  009" >9</span>
 Alas, of my children, some of you unmarried, and some who have married to no profit, I shall not see your children, nor be felicitated as a grandmother.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  010" id="16  010" >10</span>
 Ah, that I who had many and fair children, should be a lone widow full of sorrows!  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  011" id="16  011" >11</span>
 Nor, should I die, shall I have a son to bury me. But with such a lament as this the holy and God-fearing mother bewailed none of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  012" id="16  012" >12</span>
 Nor did she divert any of them from death, nor grieve for them as for the dead.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  013" id="16  013" >13</span>
 But as one possessed with an adamantine mind, and as one bringing forth again her full number of sons to immortality, she rather with supplication exhorted them to death in behalf of religion.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  014" id="16  014" >14</span>
 O woman, soldier of God for religion, you, aged and a female, have conquered through endurance even a tyrant; and though but weak, have been found more powerful in deeds and words.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  015" id="16  015" >15</span>
 For when you were seized along with your children, you stood looking upon Eleazar in torments, and said to your sons in the Hebrew tongue,  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  016" id="16  016" >16</span>
 O sons, noble is the contest; to which you being called as a witness for the nation, strive zealously for the laws of your country.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  017" id="16  017" >17</span>
 For it were disgraceful that this old man should endure pains for the sake of righteousness, and that you who are younger should be afraid of the tortures.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  018" id="16  018" >18</span>
 Remember that through God you° obtained existence, and have enjoyed it.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  019" id="16  019" >19</span>
 And on this second account you° ought to bear every affliction because of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  020" id="16  020" >20</span>
 For whom also our father Abraham was forward to sacrifice Isaac our progenitor, and shuddered not at the sight of his own paternal hand descending down with the sword upon him.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  021" id="16  021" >21</span>
 And the righteous Daniel was cast to the lions; and Ananias, and Azarias, and Misael, were slung out into a furnace of fire; yet they endured through God.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  022" id="16  022" >22</span>
 You, then, having the same faith towards God, be not troubled.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  023" id="16  023" >23</span>
 For it is unreasonable that they who know religion should not stand up against troubles.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  024" id="16  024" >24</span>
 With these arguments, the mother of seven, exhorting each of her sons, over-persuaded them from transgressing the commandment of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v05416  025" id="16  025" >25</span>
 And they saw this, too, that they who die for God, live to God; as Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the patriarchs.

<p><span class="chapter" id="17  001">17  </span> And some of the spearbearers said, that when she herself was about to be seized for the purpose of being put to death, she threw herself upon the pile, rather than they should touch her person.  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  002" id="17  002" >2</span>
 O you mother, who together with seven children did destroy the violence of the tyrant, and render void his wicked intentions, and exhibit the nobleness of faith!  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  003" id="17  003" >3</span>
 For you, as an house bravely built upon the pillar of your children, did bear without swaying, the shock of tortures.  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  004" id="17  004" >4</span>

 For your bearing of children was after the fashion of a child of Abraham.  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  007" id="17  007" >7</span>
 And, were it lawful for us to paint as on a tablet the religion of your story, the spectators would not shudder at beholding the mother of seven children enduring for the sake of religion various tortures even to death.  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  008" id="17  008" >8</span>
 And it had been a worth thing to have inscribed upon the tomb itself these words as a memorial to those of the nation,  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  009" id="17  009" >9</span>
 Here an aged priest, and an aged woman, and seven sons, are buried through the violence of a tyrant, who wished to destroy the polity of the Hebrews.  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  010" id="17  010" >10</span>
 These also avenged their nation, looking to God, and enduring torments to death.  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  011" id="17  011" >11</span>
 For it was truly a divine contest which was carried through by them.  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  012" id="17  012" >12</span>
 For at that time virtue presided over the contest, approving the victory through endurance, namely, immortality, eternal life.  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  013" id="17  013" >13</span>
 Eleazar was the first to contend: and the mother of the seven children entered the contest; and the brethren contended.  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  014" id="17  014" >14</span>
 The tyrant was the opposite; and the world and living men were the spectators.  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  015" id="17  015" >15</span>
 And reverence for God conquered, and crowned her own athletes.  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  016" id="17  016" >16</span>
 Who did not admire those champions of true legislation? who were not astonied?  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  017" id="17  017" >17</span>
 The tyrant himself, and all their council, admired their endurance;  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  018" id="17  018" >18</span>
 through which, also, they now stand beside the divine throne, and live a blessed life.  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  019" id="17  019" >19</span>
 For Moses says, And all the saints are under your hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  020" id="17  020" >20</span>
 These, therefore, having been sanctified through God, have been honored not only with this honor, but that also by their means the enemy did not overcome our nation;  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  021" id="17  021" >21</span>
 and that the tyrant was punished, and their country purified.  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  022" id="17  022" >22</span>
 For they became the ransom to the sin of the nation; and the Divine Providence saved Israel, aforetime afflicted, by the blood of those pious ones, and the propitiatory death.  <span class="verse" rel="v05417  023" id="17  023" >23</span>
