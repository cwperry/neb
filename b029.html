 Hear these   words  , you° elders, and listen all you° that inhabit the land.  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. if.  </span>  Have such things happen in your days, or in the days of your fathers?  <span class="verse" rel="v0291  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 Tell your children concerning them, and   let   your children   tell   their children, and their children another generation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0291  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 The leavings of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        It is difficult to assign the exact meaning of the Greek.  </span>  caterpillar has the locust eaten, and the leavings of the locust has the palmerworm eaten, and the leavings of the palmerworm has the cankerworm eaten.  <span class="verse" rel="v0291  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 Awake, you° drunkards, from  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. their.  </span>  your wine, and weep: mourn, all you° that drink wine to drunkenness: for joy and gladness and removed are from your mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0291  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 For a strong and innumerable nation is come up against my land, their teeth are lion's teeth, and their back teeth those of a   lion's   whelp.  <span class="verse" rel="v0291  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 He has ruined my vine, and utterly broken my fig-trees: he has utterly searched   my vine  , and cast it down; he has  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. whitened, Gen 30,37.  </span>  peeled its branches.  <span class="verse" rel="v0291  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 Lament to me more than a virgin girded with sackcloth for the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        i.e. one who married her as a virgin.  </span>  husband of her youth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0291  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 The meat-offering and drink-offering are removed from the house of the Lord: mourn, you° priests that serve at the altar of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0291  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 For the plains languish: let the land mourn, for the corn languishes; the wine is dried up, the oil becomes scarce;  <span class="verse" rel="v0291  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 the husbandmen are consumed: mourn your property on account of the wheat and barley; for the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, vintage.  </span>  harvest has perished from off the field.  <span class="verse" rel="v0291  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 The vine is dried up, and the fig-trees are become few; the pomegranate, and palm tree, and apple, and all trees of the field are dried up: for the sons of men  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. disfigured, or, disgraced.  </span>  have have abolished joy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0291  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 Gird yourselves   with sackcloth  , and lament, you° priests: mourn, you° that serve at the altar: go in, sleep in sackcloths, you° that minister to God: for the meat-offering and drink-offering are withheld from the house of your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0291  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 Sanctify a fast, proclaim a   solemn   service, gather the elders   and   all the inhabitants of the land into the house of your God, and cry earnestly to the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v0291  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 Alas, Alas, Alas for the day! for the day of the Lord is near, and it will come as trouble upon trouble.  <span class="verse" rel="v0291  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
    Your   meat has been destroyed before your eyes, joy and gladness from out of the house of your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0291  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 The heifers have started at their mangers, the treasures are abolished, the wine presses are broken down; for the corn is withered.  <span class="verse" rel="v0291  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 What shall we store up for ourselves? the herds of cattle have mourned, because they had no pasture; and the flocks of sheep have been utterly destroyed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0291  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 To you, O Lord, will I cry: for fire has devoured the fair places of the wilderness, and a flame has burnt up all the trees of the field.  <span class="verse" rel="v0291  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 And the cattle of the field have looked up to you: for the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. issues. See 2 Ki22:16. Ezek47:4  </span>  fountains of waters have been dried up, and fire has devoured the fair places of the wilderness.

<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> Sound the trumpet in Sion, make a proclamation in my holy mountain, and let all the inhabitants of the land be confounded: for the day of the Lord is near;  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 for a day of darkness and gloominess is near, a day of cloud and mist: a numerous and strong people shall be spread upon the mountains as the morning; there has not been from the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. age.  </span>  beginning one like it, and after it there shall not be again even to the years of many generations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 Before  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. it, sc. the people.  </span>  them is a consuming fire, and behind them is a flame kindled: the land before them is as a paradise of delight, and behind them a desolate plain: and there shall none  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit. to him, sc. the people.  </span>  of them escape.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 Their appearance is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they pursue.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 As the sound of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, and as the sound of a flame of fire devouring stubble, and as a numerous and strong people setting themselves in array for battle.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 Before them shall the people be crushed: every face   shall be   as the blackness of a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or, pot.  </span>  caldron.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 As warriors shall they run, and as men of war shall they mount on the walls; and each shall move in his   right   path, and they shall not turn aside from their tracks:  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 and not one shall stand aloof from his brother: they shall go on weighed down with their arms, and they fall upon their weapons, yet shall they in no wise be destroyed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 They shall seize upon the city, and run upon the walls, and go up upon the houses, and enter in through the windows as thieves.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 Before them the earth shall be confounded, and the sky shall be shaken: the sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their light.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 And the Lord shall utter his voice before his host: for his camp is very great: for the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. works.  </span>  execution of his words is mighty: for the day of the Lord is great, very glorious, and who shall be  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. sufficient for it?  </span>  able to   resist   it?  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 Now therefore, says the Lord your God, turn to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with lamentation:  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 and rend your hearts, and not your garments, and turn to the Lord your God: for he is merciful and compassionate, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy, and repents of evils.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 Who knows if he will return, and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meat-offering and a drink-offering to the Lord your God?  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 Sound the trumpet in Sion, sanctify a fast, proclaim a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See ch 1:14.  </span>    solemn   service:  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the infants at the breast: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 Between the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. base.  </span>  porch and the altar let the priests that minister to the Lord weep, and say, Spare your people, O Lord, and give not your heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them, lest they should say among the heathen, Where is their God?  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 But the Lord was jealous of his land, and spared his people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 And the Lord answered and said to his people, Behold, I   will   send you corn, and wine, and oil, and you° shall be satisfied with them: and I will no longer make you a reproach among the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 And I will chase away from you the northern   adversary  , and will drive him away into a dry land, and I will sink  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. cause to disappear.  </span>  his face in the former sea, and his back parts in the latter sea, and his  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. corruption.  </span>  ill savor shall come up, and his  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See Job 6,7.  </span>  stink come up, because he has  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. magnified his works.  </span>  wrought great things.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 Be of good courage, O land; rejoice and be glad: for the Lord has done great things.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 Be of good courage, you° beasts of the plain, for the plains of the wilderness have budded, for the trees have borne their fruit, the fig tree and the vine have yielded their strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  023" id="2  023" >23</span>
 Rejoice then and be glad, you° children of Sion, in the Lord your God: for he has given you food  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr. to exactness.  </span>  fully, and he will rain on you the early and the latter rain, as before.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  024" id="2  024" >24</span>
 And the floors shall be filled with corn, and the presses shall overflow with wine and oil.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  025" id="2  025" >25</span>
 And I will recompense you for the years which the locust, and the caterpillar, and the palmerworm, and the cankerworm have eaten,   even   my great army, which I sent against you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  026" id="2  026" >26</span>
 And you° shall eat abundantly, and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of the Lord your God   for the things   which he has wrought wonderfully with you: and my people shall not be ashamed for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  027" id="2  027" >27</span>
 And you° shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and   that   I am the Lord your God, and   that   there is none else beside me; and my people shall no more be ashamed for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  028" id="2  028" >28</span>
 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  029" id="2  029" >29</span>
 And on my servants and on   my   handmaids in those days will I pour out of my Spirit.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  030" id="2  030" >30</span>
 And I will show wonders in heaven, and upon the earth, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  031" id="2  031" >31</span>
 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and glorious day of the Lord come.  <span class="verse" rel="v0292  032" id="2  032" >32</span>
 And it shall come to pass   that   whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved: for in mount Sion and in Jerusalem shall the saved one be as the Lord has said, and they that have glad tidings preached to them, whom the Lord has called.
