<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">A</span>nd it came to pass after the death of Moses, that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of Naue, the minister of Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0061  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 Moses my servant is dead; now then arise, go over Jordan, you and all this people, into the land, which I give them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0061  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 Every spot on which you° shall tread I will give it to you, as I said to Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0061  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 The wilderness and Antilibanus, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, and as far as the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   last,   or,   farthest sea.  </span>  extremity of the sea; your costs shall be from the setting of the sun.  <span class="verse" rel="v0061  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 Not a man shall stand against you all the days of your life; and as I was with Moses, so will I also be with you, and          Heb 13:5    I will not fail you, or neglect you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0061  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 Be strong and 'quit yourself like a man, for you shall divide the land to this people, which I sware to give to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to your fathers, to give them.  </span>  your fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v0061  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 Be strong, therefore, and quit yourself like a man, to observe and do as Moses my servant commanded you; and you shall not turn  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from them,   sc.   the commands.  </span>  therefrom to the right hand or to the left, that you may be wise in whatever you may do.  <span class="verse" rel="v0061  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 And the book of this law shall not depart out of your mouth, and you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may know how to do all the things that are written   in it  ; then shall you prosper, and make your ways prosperous, and then shall you be wise.  <span class="verse" rel="v0061  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 Behold! I have commanded you; be strong and courageous, be not cowardly nor fearful, for the Lord your God is with you in all places whither you go.  <span class="verse" rel="v0061  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 And Joshua commanded the scribes of the people, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0061  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 Go into the midst of the camp of the people, and command the people, saying, Prepare provisions; for yet three days and you°  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   do go over.  </span>  shall go over this Jordan, entering in to take possession of the land, which the Lord God of your fathers gives to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0061  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 And to Ruben, and to Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasse, Joshua said,  <span class="verse" rel="v0061  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, the Lord your God has caused you to rest, and has given you this land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0061  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 Let your wives and your children and your cattle dwell in the land, which he has given you; and you° shall go over  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   in good order.  </span>  well armed before your brethren, every one of you who is strong; and you° shall fight on their side;  <span class="verse" rel="v0061  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 until the Lord your God shall have given your brethren rest, as also to you, and they also shall have inherited the land, which the Lord your God gives them; then you° shall depart each one to his inheritance, which Moses gave you beyond Jordan eastward.  <span class="verse" rel="v0061  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 And they answered Joshua and said, We will do all things which you command us, and we will go to every place whither you shall send us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0061  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 Whereinsoever we listened to Moses we will listen to you; only let the Lord our God be with you, as he was with Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0061  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 And whoever shall disobey you, and whoever shall not listen to your words as you shall command him, let him die; but be you strong and courageous.

<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> And Joshua the son of Naue sent out of Sattin two young men to spy   the land  , saying, Go up and view the land and Jericho: and the two young men went and entered into Jericho; and they entered into the house of a harlot, whose name   was   Raab, and lodged there.  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 An it was reported to the king of Jericho, saying, Men of the sons of Israel have come in hither to spy the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 And the king of Jericho sent and spoke to Raab, saying, Bring out the men that entered into your house this night; for they are come to spy out the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 And the woman took the two men and hid them; and she spoke to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   them.  </span>  the messengers, saying, The men came in to me,  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 but when the gate was shut in the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   dark.  </span>  evening, the men went out; I know not whither they are gone: follow after them, if you°  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   shall.  </span>  may overtake them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 But she   had   brought them up upon the house, and hid them in the flax-stalks that were spread by her on the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 And the men followed after them in the way to Jordan to the fords; and the gate was shut.  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 And it came to pass when the men who pursued after them were gone forth, and before the spies had lain down to sleep, that she came up to them on the top of the house;  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 and she said to them, I know that the Lord has given you the land; for the fear of you has fallen upon us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 For we have heard that the Lord God dried up the Red Sea before you, when you° came out of the land of Egypt, and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, to Seon and Og, whom you° utterly destroyed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 And when we heard it we were amazed in our heart, and there was no longer any spirit in any of us because of you, for the Lord your god   is   God in heaven above, and on the earth beneath.  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 And now swear to me by the Lord God; since I deal mercifully with you, so do you° also deal mercifully with the house of my father:  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 and save alive the house of my father, my mother, and my brethren, and all my house, and all that they have, and you° shall rescue my soul from death.  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 And the men said to her, Our life for yours   even   to death: and she said, When the Lord shall have delivered the city to you, you° shall deal mercifully and truly with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 And she let them down by the window;  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 and she said to them, Depart into the hill-country, lest the pursuers meet you, and you° shall be hidden there three days until your pursuers return from after you, and afterwards you° shall depart on your way.  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 And the men said to her, We are clear of this your oath.  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 Behold,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   do enter.  </span>  we shall enter into a part of the city, and you shall set  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the sign.  </span>  a sign; you shall bind this scarlet cord in the window, by which you have let us down, and you shall bring in to yourself, into your house, your father, and your mother, and your brethren, and all the family of your father.  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 And it shall come to pass that whoever shall go outside the door of your house, his guilt shall be upon him, and we shall be quit of this your oath; and we will be responsible for all that shall be found with you in your house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 But if any one should injure us, or betray these our matters, we shall be quit of this your oath.  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 And she said to them, Let it be according to your word; and she sent them out, and they departed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 And they came to the hill-country, and remained there three days; and the pursuers searched all the roads, and found them not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  023" id="2  023" >23</span>
 And the two young men returned, and came down out of the mountain; and they went over to Joshua the son of Naue, and told him all things that had happened to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0062  024" id="2  024" >24</span>
 And they said to Joshua, The Lord has delivered all the land into our power, and all the inhabitants of that land tremble because of us.  
<!-- 3   024 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and departed from Sattin; and they came as far as Jordan, and lodged there before they crossed over.  <span class="verse" rel="v0063  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 And it came to pass after three days,   that   the scribes went through the camp;  <span class="verse" rel="v0063  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 and they charged the people, saying, When you° shall see the ark of the covenant of the Lord our God, and our priests and the Levites bearing it, you° shall depart from your places, and you° shall go after it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0063  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 But let there be a distance between you and it; you° shall stand as much as two thousand cubits   from it  . Do not draw near to it, that you° may know the way which you° are to go; for you° have not gone the way  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from yesterday and the third day. A frequent Hebraism.  </span>  before.  <span class="verse" rel="v0063  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, for to-morrow the Lord will do wonders among you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0063  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 And Joshua said to the priests, Take up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and go before the people: and the priests took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and went before the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0063  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 And the Lord said to Joshua, This day do I begin to exalt you before all the children of Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so will I also be with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0063  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 And now charge the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, As soon as you° shall enter on a part of the water of Jordan, then you° shall stand in Jordan.  <span class="verse" rel="v0063  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 And Joshua said to the children of Israel,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   bring hither.   sc.   yourselves.  </span>  Come hither, and listen to the word of the Lord our God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0063  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 Hereby you° shall know that the living God   is   among you, and will utterly destroy from before our face the Chananite, and the Chettite and Pherezite, and the Evite, and the Amorite, and the Gergesite, and the Jebusite.  <span class="verse" rel="v0063  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over Jordan.  <span class="verse" rel="v0063  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 Choose for yourselves twelve men of the sons of Israel, one of each tribe.  <span class="verse" rel="v0063  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 And it shall come to pass, when the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth rest in the water of Jordan, the water of Jordan   below   shall fail, and the water coming down from above shall stop.  <span class="verse" rel="v0063  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 And the people removed from their tents to cross over Jordan, and the priests bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord before the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0063  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 And when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord entered upon Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord were dipped in part of the water of Jordan; (now Jordan  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   its whole channel.  </span>  overflowed all its banks  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   as on the days.  </span>  about the time of wheat harvest:)  <span class="verse" rel="v0063  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 then the waters that came down from above stopped; there stood one solid heap very far off, as far as  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a part.  </span>  the region of Kariathiarim, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   that which came down.  </span>  the lower part came down to the sea of Araba, the salt sea, till it completely failed; and the people stood opposite Jericho.  <span class="verse" rel="v0063  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood on dry land in the midst of Jordan; and all the children of Israel went through on dry land, until all the people had completely gone over Jordan.  
<!-- 4   017 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> And when the people had completely passed over Jordan, the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  002" id="4  002" >2</span>

 said to them, Advance before me in the presence of the Lord into the midst of Jordan, and each having taken up a stone from thence, let him carry it on his shoulders, according to the number of the twelve tribes of Israel:  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 that these may be to you continually for an appointed sign, that when your son asks you  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   of the distinguished, or, illustrious.  </span>  in future, saying, What are these stones to us?  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 then you may explain to your son, saying, The river Jordan was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   failed.  </span>  dried up from before the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth, when it passed it: and these stones shall be for a memorial for you for the children of Israel for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 And the children of Israel did so, as the Lord commanded Joshua; and they took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, (as the Lord commanded Joshua, when the children of Israel had completely passed over,) and carried these stones with them into the camp, and laid them down there.  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 And Joshua set also other twelve stones in Jordan itself, in the place that was under the feet of the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and there they are to this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant stood in Jordan, until Joshua   had   finished all that the Lord commanded him to report to the people; and the people hasted and passed over.  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 And it came to pass when all the people had passed over, that the ark of the covenant of the Lord passed over, and the stones before them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 And the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse passed over  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   equipped.  </span>  armed before the children of Israel, as Moses commanded them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 Forty thousand  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in good order.  </span>  armed for battle went over before the Lord to war, to the city of Jericho.  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  014" id="4  014" >14</span>
 In that day the Lord magnified Joshua before all the people of Israel; and they feared him, as   they did   Moses, as long as he lived.  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  015" id="4  015" >15</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  016" id="4  016" >16</span>
 Charge the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the testimony of the Lord, to go up out of Jordan.  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  017" id="4  017" >17</span>
 And Joshua charged the priests, saying, Go up out of Jordan.  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  018" id="4  018" >18</span>
 And it came to pass when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord were gone up out of Jordan, and set their feet upon the land,   that   the water of Jordan returned impetuously to its place, and went as before over all its banks.  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  019" id="4  019" >19</span>
 And the people went up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month; and the children of Israel encamped in Galgala in the region eastward from Jericho.  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  020" id="4  020" >20</span>
 And Joshua set these twelve stones which he took out of Jordan, in Galgala,  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  021" id="4  021" >21</span>
 saying, When your sons ask you, saying, What are these stones?  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  022" id="4  022" >22</span>
 Tell your sons, that Israel went over this Jordan on dry land,  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  023" id="4  023" >23</span>
 when the Lord our God had dried up the water of Jordan from before them, until they had passed over; as the Lord our God did to the Red Sea, which the Lord our God dried up from before us, until we passed over.  <span class="verse" rel="v0064  024" id="4  024" >24</span>
 That all the nations of the earth might know, that the power of the Lord is mighty, and that you° might worship the Lord our God in every work.

<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> And it came to pass when the kings of the Amorites who were beyond Jordan heard, and the kings of Phoenicia by the sea, that the Lord God had dried up the river Jordan from before the children of Israel when they passed over, that their hearts failed, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   their minds or thoughts melted.  </span>  they were terror-stricken, and there was no sense in them  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from the face of.  </span>  because of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0065  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 And about this time the Lord said to Joshua, Make you stone knives of sharp stone, and sit down and circumcise the children of Israel the second time.  <span class="verse" rel="v0065  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 And Joshua made sharp knives of stone, and circumcised the children of Israel at the place called the “Hill of Foreskins.”  <span class="verse" rel="v0065  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 And   this is   the way in which Joshua purified the children of Israel; as many as were born in the way, and as many as were uncircumcised of them that came out of Egypt,  <span class="verse" rel="v0065  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 all these Joshua circumcised; for forty and two years Israel wondered in the wilderness of Mabdaris—  <span class="verse" rel="v0065  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 Therefore most of the fighting men that came out of the land of Egypt, were uncircumcised, who disobeyed the commands of God; concerning whom also he determined that they should not see the land, which the Lord sware to give to their fathers,   even   a land flowing with milk and honey.  <span class="verse" rel="v0065  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 And in their place he raised up their sons, whom Joshua circumcised, because they were uncircumcised, having been born by the way.  <span class="verse" rel="v0065  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 And when they had been circumcised they rested  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   sitting. A frequent Hebraism.  </span>  continuing there in the camp till they were healed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0065  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 And the Lord said to Joshua the son of Naue, On this day have I removed the reproach of Egypt from you: and he called the name of that place Galgala.  <span class="verse" rel="v0065  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 And the children of Israel kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, to the westward of Jericho on the opposite side of the Jordan in the plain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0065  011" id="5  011" >11</span>
 And they ate of the grain of the earth unleavened and new   corn  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0065  012" id="5  012" >12</span>
 In this day the manna failed, after they had eaten of the corn of the land, and the children of Israel no longer had manna: and they took the fruits of the land of the Phoenicians in that year.  <span class="verse" rel="v0065  013" id="5  013" >13</span>
 And it came to pass when Joshua was in Jericho, that he looked up with his eyes and saw a man standing before him, and   there was   a drawn sword in his hand; and Joshua drew near and said to him, Are you for us or on the side of our enemies?  <span class="verse" rel="v0065  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 And he said to him, I am now come, the chief captain of the host of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0065  015" id="5  015" >15</span>
 And Joshua fell on his face upon the earth, and said to him, Lord, what command you your servant?  <span class="verse" rel="v0065  016" id="5  016" >16</span>
 And the captain of the Lord's host said to Joshua, Loose your shoe off your feet, for the place whereon you now stand is holy.

<p><span class="chapter" id="6  001">6  </span> Now Jericho was closely shut up and besieged, and none went out of it, and none came in.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  002" id="6  002" >2</span>
 And the Lord said to Joshua, Behold, I deliver Jericho into your power, and its king in it,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   mighty in strength.  </span>    and its   mighty men.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  003" id="6  003" >3</span>
 And do you set the men of war round about it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  004" id="6  004" >4</span>
 And it shall be   that   when you° shall sound with the trumpet,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   let all the people, etc.  </span>  all the people shall shout together.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  005" id="6  005" >5</span>
 And when they have shouted, the walls of the city shall fall  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   of their own accord.  </span>  of themselves; and all the people shall enter, each one rushing direct into the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  006" id="6  006" >6</span>
 And Joshua the   son   of Naue went in to the priests, and spoke to them, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  007" id="6  007" >7</span>
 And let seven priests having seven  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. שופרוה היוכליס   A.V.   'ram's horns.'

 Charge the people to go round, and encompass the city; and let your men of war pass on armed before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  009" id="6  009" >9</span>
 And let the men of war proceed before, and the priests bringing up the rear behind the ark of the covenant of the Lord   proceed   sounding the trumpets.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  010" id="6  010" >10</span>
 And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Cry not out, nor let any one hear your voice, until he himself declare to you the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   day.  </span>  time to cry out, and then you° shall cry out.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  011" id="6  011" >11</span>
 And the ark of the covenant of God having gone round immediately returned into the camp, and lodged there.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  012" id="6  012" >12</span>
 And on the second day Joshua rose up in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  013" id="6  013" >13</span>
 And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets went on before the Lord; and afterwards the men of war went on, and the remainder of the multitude went after the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  014" id="6  014" >14</span>
 And all the rest of the multitude compassed the city six times from within a short distance, and went back again into the camp; this they did six days.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  015" id="6  015" >15</span>
 And on the seventh day they rose up early, and compassed the city on that day seven times.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  016" id="6  016" >16</span>
 And it came to pass at the seventh circuit the priests blew the trumpets; and Joshua said to the children of Israel, Shout, for the Lord has given you the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  017" id="6  017" >17</span>
 And the city shall be  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   an accursed thing.  </span>  devoted, it and all things that are in it, to the Lord of Hosts: only do you° save Raab the harlot, and all things in her house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  018" id="6  018" >18</span>
 But keep yourselves strictly from the accursed thing, lest you° set your mind upon and take of the accursed thing, and you° make the camp of the children of Israel and accursed thing, and destroy us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  019" id="6  019" >19</span>
 And all the silver, or gold, or brass, or iron, shall be holy to the Lord; it shall be carried into the treasury of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  020" id="6  020" >20</span>
 And the priests sounded with the trumpets: and when the people heard the trumpets, all the people shouted at once with a loud and strong shout; and all the wall fell round about, and all the people went up into the city:  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  021" id="6  021" >21</span>
 and Joshua devoted it to destruction, and all things that were in the city, man and woman, young man and old, and calf and ass, with the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   mouth.  </span>  edge of the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  022" id="6  022" >22</span>
 And Joshua said to the two young men who had acted a spies, Go into the house of the woman, and bring her out thence, and all that she has.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  023" id="6  023" >23</span>
 And the two young men who had spied out the city entered into the house of the woman, and brought out Raab the harlot, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and her kindred, and all that she had; and they set her without the camp of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  024" id="6  024" >24</span>
 And the city was burnt with fire with all things that were in it; only of the silver, and gold, and brass, and iron, they gave to be brought into the treasury of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  025" id="6  025" >25</span>
 And Joshua saved alive Raab the harlot, and all the house of her father, and caused her to dwell in Israel until this day, because she hid the spies which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  026" id="6  026" >26</span>
 And Joshua adjured   them   on that day before the Lord, saying, Cursed   be   the man who shall build that city: he shall lay the foundation of it in his firstborn, and he shall set up the gates of it in his youngest son. And so did Hozan of Baethel; he laid the foundation in Abiron his firstborn, and set up the gates of it in his youngest  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   saved.  </span>  surviving son.  <span class="verse" rel="v0066  027" id="6  027" >27</span>
 And the Lord was with Joshua, and his name was in all the land.

<p><span class="chapter" id="7  001">7  </span> But the children of Israel committed a great trespass, and purloined   part   of the accursed thing; and Achar the son of Charmi, the son of Zambri, the son of Zara, of the tribe of Juda, took of the accursed thing; and the Lord was very angry with the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  002" id="7  002" >2</span>
 And Joshua sent men to Gai, which is by Baethel, saying, Spy out Gai: and the men went up and spied Gai.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  003" id="7  003" >3</span>
 And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and take the city by siege: carry not up there the whole people, for   the enemy   are few.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  004" id="7  004" >4</span>
 And there went up about three thousand men, and they fled from before the men of Gai.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  005" id="7  005" >5</span>
 And the men of Gai killed of them to the number of thirty-six men, and they pursued them from the gate, and destroyed them from the steep hill; and the heart of the people was alarmed and became as water.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  006" id="7  006" >6</span>
 And Joshua tore his garments; and Joshua fell on the earth on his face before the Lord until evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they cast dust on their heads.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  007" id="7  007" >7</span>
 And Joshua said, I pray, Lord, therefore has your servant brought this people over Jordan to deliver them to the Amorite to destroy us?  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and if we had.  </span>  would we had remained and settled ourselves beyond Jordan.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  008" id="7  008" >8</span>

 And the Lord said to Joshua, Rise up; why have you fallen upon your face?  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  011" id="7  011" >11</span>
 The people has sinned, and transgressed the covenant which I made with them; they have stolen from the cursed thing, and put it into their store.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  012" id="7  012" >12</span>
 And the children of Israel will not be able to stand before their enemies; they will turn their back before their enemies, for they have become an accursed thing: I will not any longer be with you, unless you° remove the cursed thing from yourselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  013" id="7  013" >13</span>
 Rise, sanctify the people and tell them to sanctify themselves for the morrow: thus says the Lord God of Israel, The accursed thing is among you; you° shall not be able to stand before your enemies, until you° shall have removed the cursed thing from among you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  014" id="7  014" >14</span>
 And you° shall all be gathered together by your tribes in the morning, and it shall come to pass that the tribe which the Lord shall show, you° shall bring by families; and the family which the Lord shall show, you° shall bring by households; and the household which the Lord shall show, you° shall bring man by man.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  015" id="7  015" >15</span>
 And the man who shall be pointed out, shall be burnt with fire, and all that he has; because he has transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and has wrought wickedness in Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  016" id="7  016" >16</span>
 And Joshua rose up early, and brought the people by their tribes; and the tribe of Juda was pointed out.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  017" id="7  017" >17</span>
 And it was brought by their families, and family of the Zaraites was pointed out.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  018" id="7  018" >18</span>
 And it was brought man by man, and Achar the son of Zambri the son of Zara was pointed out.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  019" id="7  019" >19</span>
 And Joshua said to Achar, Give glory this day to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession; and tell me what you have done, and hide it not from me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  020" id="7  020" >20</span>
 And Achar answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel: thus and thus have I done:  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  021" id="7  021" >21</span>
 I saw in the spoil an embroidered mantle, and two hundred didrachmas of silver, and one golden wedge of fifty didrachmas, and I desired them and took them; and, behold, they are hid in my tent, and the silver is hid under them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  022" id="7  022" >22</span>
 And Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent into the camp; and these things were hidden in his tent, and the silver under them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  023" id="7  023" >23</span>
 And they brought them out of the tent, and brought them to Joshua and the elders of Israel, and they laid them before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  024" id="7  024" >24</span>
 And Joshua took Achar the son of Zara, and brought him to the valley of Achor, and his sons, and his daughters, and his calves, and his asses, and all his sheep, and his tent, and all his property, and all the people   were   with him; and he brought them to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. צמק צכור valley of trouble.  </span>  Emec Achor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0067  025" id="7  025" >25</span>

 And Joshua and all the men of war rose to go up to Gai; and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men, and he sent them away by night.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  004" id="8  004" >4</span>

 And all the men of war went up with him, and they went forward and came over against the city eastward.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  12-13" id="8  12-13" >12-13</span>
 And the ambuscade   was   on the west side of the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 And it came to pass when the king of Gai saw   it  , he hasted and went out to meet them direct to the battle, he and all the people   that were   with him: and he knew not that there was an ambuscade   formed   against him behind the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  015" id="8  015" >15</span>
 And Joshua and Israel saw, and retreated from before them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  016" id="8  016" >16</span>
 And they pursued after the children of Israel, and they themselves went to a distance from the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  017" id="8  017" >17</span>
 There was no one left in Gai who did not pursue after Israel; and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  018" id="8  018" >18</span>
 And the Lord said to Joshua, Stretch forth your hand with the spear that is in your hand toward the city, for I have delivered it into your hands; and the liers in wait shall rise up quickly out of their place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  019" id="8  019" >19</span>
 And Joshua stretched out his hand   and   his spear toward the city, and the ambuscade rose up quickly out of their place; and they came forth when he stretched out his hand; and they entered into the city, and took it; and they hasted and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   set it on fire.  </span>  burnt the city with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  020" id="8  020" >20</span>
 And when the inhabitants of Gai looked round behind them, then they saw the smoke going up out of the city to heaven, and they were no longer able to flee this way or that way.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  021" id="8  021" >21</span>
 And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambuscade  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   took.  </span>  had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city went up to heaven; and they turned and struck the men of Gai.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  022" id="8  022" >22</span>
 And these came forth out of the city to meet them; and they were in the midst of the army, some   being   on this side, and some on that; and they struck them until there was not left of them one who survived and escaped.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  023" id="8  023" >23</span>
 And they took the king of Gai alive, and brought him to Joshua.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  024" id="8  024" >24</span>
 And when the children of Israel had ceased slaying all that were in Gai, and in the fields, and in the mountain on the descent, from whence they pursued them   even   to the end, then Joshua returned to Gai, and struck it with the edge of the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  25-26" id="8  25-26" >25-26</span>
 And they that fell in that day, men and women, were twelve thousand:   they killed   all the inhabitants of Gai.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  027" id="8  027" >27</span>
 Beside the spoils that were in the city, all things which the children of Israel took as spoil for themselves according to the command of the Lord, as the Lord commanded Joshua.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  028" id="8  028" >28</span>
 And Joshua burnt the city with fire: he made it an uninhabited heap for ever,   even   to this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  029" id="8  029" >29</span>
 And he hanged the king of Gai on a  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   double tree.  </span>  gallows; and he remained on the tree till evening: and when the sun went down, Joshua gave charge, and they took down his body from the tree, and cast it into  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the pit or trench. For vv. 30-35, see chap. 8. 2.  </span>  a pit, and they set over him a heap of stones until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  030" id="8  030" >30</span>
 Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord God of Israel in mount Gaebal,  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  031" id="8  031" >31</span>
 as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, on which iron  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   was not lifted up.  </span>  had not been lifted up; and he offered there whole burnt offerings to the Lord, and a peace-offering.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  032" id="8  032" >32</span>
 And Joshua wrote upon the stones  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   a Deuteronomy.  </span>  a copy of the law, even the law of Moses, before the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  033" id="8  033" >33</span>
 And all Israel, and their elders, and their judges, and their scribes, passed on one side and on the other before the ark; and the priests and the Levites took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and the stranger and the native were there, who were half of them near mount Garizin, and half near mount Gaebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded at first, to bless the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  034" id="8  034" >34</span>
 And afterwards Joshua read accordingly all the words of this law, the blessings and the curses, according to all things written in the law of Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0068  035" id="8  035" >35</span>
 There was not a word of all that Moses charged Joshua, which Joshua read not in the ears of all the assembly of the children of Israel, the men, and the women, and the children, and the strangers that joined themselves to Israel.

 And the inhabitants of Gabaon heard of all that the Lord did to Jericho and Gai.  <span class="verse" rel="v0069  004" id="9  004" >4</span>
 And they also wrought craftily, and they went and made provision and prepared themselves; and having taken old sacks on their shoulders, and old and tore and patched bottles of wine,  <span class="verse" rel="v0069  005" id="9  005" >5</span>

 And they came to Joshua into the camp of Israel to Galgala, and said to Joshua and Israel, We are come from a far land: now then make a covenant with us.  <span class="verse" rel="v0069  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 And the children of Israel said to the Chorrhaean, Peradventure you dwell among us; and how should I make a covenant with you?  <span class="verse" rel="v0069  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 And they said to Joshua, We are your servants: and Joshua said to them, Whence are you°, and whence have you° come?  <span class="verse" rel="v0069  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 And they said, Your servants are come from a very far country in the name of the Lord your God: for we have heard his name, and all that he did in Egypt,  <span class="verse" rel="v0069  010" id="9  010" >10</span>
 and all that he did to the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, to Seon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Basan, who lived in Astaroth and in Edrain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0069  011" id="9  011" >11</span>

 These   are   the loaves—we took them hot for our journey on the day on which we came out to come to you; and now they are dried and become mouldy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0069  013" id="9  013" >13</span>
 And these   are   the skins of wine which we filled when new, and they are tore; and our garments and our shoes are worn out because of the very long journey.  <span class="verse" rel="v0069  014" id="9  014" >14</span>
 And the chiefs took of their provision, and asked not   counsel of   the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0069  015" id="9  015" >15</span>
 And Joshua made peace with them, and they made a covenant with them to preserve them; and the princes of the congregation sware to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0069  016" id="9  016" >16</span>
 And it came to pass  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   after three days after, etc.  </span>  three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were near neighbors, and that they  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   dwell.  </span>  lived among them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0069  017" id="9  017" >17</span>
 And the children of Israel departed and came to their cities; and their cities   were   Gabaon, and Kephira, and Berot, and the cities of Jarin.  <span class="verse" rel="v0069  018" id="9  018" >18</span>

 They shall live, and shall be hewers of wood and drawers of water to all the congregation, as the princes said to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0069  022" id="9  022" >22</span>
 And Joshua called them together and said to them, Why have you° deceived me, saying, We live very far from you; whereas you° are fellow-countrymen of those who dwell among us?  <span class="verse" rel="v0069  023" id="9  023" >23</span>

 And they answered Joshua, saying, It was reported to us what the Lord your God charged his servant Moses, to give you this land, and to destroy us and all that lived on it from before you; and we feared very much for our lives  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from before you.  </span>  because of you, and   therefore   we did this thing.  <span class="verse" rel="v0069  025" id="9  025" >25</span>

 And they did so to them; and Joshua rescued them in that day out of the hands of the children of Israel, and they did not kill them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0069  027" id="9  027" >27</span>
 And Joshua made them in that day hewers of wood and drawers of water to the whole congregation, and for the altar of God: therefore the inhabitants of Gabaon became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the altar of God until this day, even for the place which the Lord should choose.  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The following verses are additions to Brenton's text from the alexandrine codex.

<p><span class="chapter" id="10  001">10  </span> And when Adoni-bezec king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Gai, and had destroyed it, as he did to Jericho and its king, even so they did to Gai and its king, and that the inhabitants of Gabaon had gone over to Joshua and Israel;  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  002" id="10  002" >2</span>
 then they were greatly terrified by them, for   the king   knew that Gabaon   was   a great city, as one of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   mother-cities.  </span>  chief cities, and all its men   were   mighty.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  003" id="10  003" >3</span>
 So Adoni-bezec king of Jerusalem sent to Elam king of Hebron, and to Phidon king of Jerimuth, and to Jephtha king of Lachis, and to Dabin king of Odollam, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  004" id="10  004" >4</span>
 Come up hither to me, and help me, and let us take Gabaon; for the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   they.  </span>  Gabaonites have gone over to Joshua and to the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  005" id="10  005" >5</span>
 And the five kings of the Jebusites went up, the king of Jerusalem, and the king of Chebron, and the king of Jerimuth, and the king of Lachis, and the king of Odollam, they and all their people; and encamped around Gabaon, and besieged it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  006" id="10  006" >6</span>
 And the inhabitants of Gabaon sent to Joshua into the camp to Galgala, saying, Slack not your hands from your servants: come up quickly to us, and help us, and rescue us; for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country are gathered together against us.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  007" id="10  007" >7</span>
 And Joshua went up from Galgala, he and all the people of war with him, every one mighty in strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  008" id="10  008" >8</span>
 And the Lord said to Joshua, Fear them not, for I have delivered them into your hands; there shall not one of them be left before you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  009" id="10  009" >9</span>
 And when Joshua came suddenly upon them, he   had   advanced all the night out of Galgala.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  010" id="10  010" >10</span>
 And the Lord struck them with terror before the children of Israel; and the Lord destroyed them with a great slaughter at Gabaon; and they pursued them by the way of the going up of Oronin, and they struck them to Azeca and to Makeda.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  011" id="10  011" >11</span>
 And when they fled from the face of the children of Israel at the descent of Oronin, then the Lord cast upon them hailstones from heaven to Azeca; and they were more that died by the hailstones, than those whom the children of Israel killed with the sword in the battle.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  012" id="10  012" >12</span>
 Then Joshua spoke to the Lord, in the day in which the Lord delivered the Amorite into the power of Israel, when he destroyed them in Gabaon, and they were destroyed from before the children of Israel: and Joshua said, Let the sun stand over against Gabaon, and the moon over against the valley of Aelon.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  013" id="10  013" >13</span>
 And the sun and the moon stood still, until God executed vengeance on their enemies; and the sun stood still in the midst of heaven; it did not proceed to set till the end of  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        i.e.   additional day without a night between.  </span>  one day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  14-15" id="10  14-15" >14-15</span>
 And there was not such a day either before or after, so that God should listen to a man, because the Lord fought on the side of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  016" id="10  016" >16</span>
 And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave that is in Makeda.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  017" id="10  017" >17</span>
 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings have been found hid in the cave that is in Makeda.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  018" id="10  018" >18</span>
 And Joshua said, Roll stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men to watch over them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  019" id="10  019" >19</span>
 But do not you° stand, but pursue after your enemies, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   fasten upon or seize.  </span>  attack the rear of them, and do not suffer them to enter into their cities; for the Lord our God has delivered them into our hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  020" id="10  020" >20</span>
 And it came to pass when Joshua and all Israel ceased destroying them utterly with a very great slaughter, that they that escaped took refuge in the strong cities.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  021" id="10  021" >21</span>
 And all the people returned  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   sound, or healthy.  </span>  safe to Joshua to Makeda; and no one of the children of Israel murmured with his tongue.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  022" id="10  022" >22</span>
 And Joshua said, Open the cave, and bring out these five kings out of the cave.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  023" id="10  023" >23</span>
 And they brought out the five kings out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, and the king of Chebron, and the king of Jerimuth, and the king of Lachis, and the king of Odollam.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  024" id="10  024" >24</span>
 And when they brought them out to Joshua, then Joshua called together all Israel, and the chiefs  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   of the war.  </span>  of the army that went with him, saying to them, Come forward and set your feet on their necks; and they came and set their feet on their necks.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  025" id="10  025" >25</span>
 And Joshua said to them, Do not fear them, neither be cowardly; be courageous and strong, for thus the Lord will do to all your enemies, against whom you° fight.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  026" id="10  026" >26</span>
 And Joshua killed them, and hanged them on five trees; and they hung upon the trees until the evening.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  027" id="10  027" >27</span>
 And it came to pass toward the setting of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, and cast them into the cave into which they   had   fled for refuge, and rolled stones to the cave,   which remain   till this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  028" id="10  028" >28</span>
 And they took Makeda on that day, and killed  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   it.  </span>  the inhabitants with the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   mouth.  </span>  edge of the sword, and they utterly destroyed every living thing that was in it; and there was none left in it that was preserved and had escaped; and they did to the king of Makeda, as they did to the king of Jericho.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  029" id="10  029" >29</span>
 And Joshua and all Israel with him departed out of Makeda to Lebna, and besieged Lebna.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  030" id="10  030" >30</span>
 And the Lord delivered it into the hands of Israel: and they took it, and its king, and killed the inhabitants with the edge of the sword, and every thing breathing in it; and there was not left in it any that survived and escaped; and they did to its king, as they did to the king of Jericho.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  031" id="10  031" >31</span>
 And Joshua and all Israel with him departed from Lebna to Lachis, and he encamped about it, and besieged it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  032" id="10  032" >32</span>
 And the Lord delivered Lachis into the hands of Israel; and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   he,   i.e.   Israel.  </span>  they took it on the second day, and they put the inhabitants to death with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed it, as they had done to Lebna.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  033" id="10  033" >33</span>
 Then Elam the king of Gazer went up to help Lachis; and Joshua struck him and his people with the edge of the sword, until there was not left to him one that was preserved and escaped.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  034" id="10  034" >34</span>
 And Joshua and all Israel with him departed from Lachis to Odollam, and he besieged it and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   vigourously attacked it.  </span>  took it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  035" id="10  035" >35</span>
 And the Lord delivered it into the hand of Israel; and he took it on that day, and killed the inhabitants with the edge of the sword, and killed every thing breathing in it, as they did to Lachis.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  036" id="10  036" >36</span>
 And Joshua and all Israel with him departed to Chebron, and encamped about it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  037" id="10  037" >37</span>

 And Joshua and all Israel returned to Dabir; and they encamped about it;  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  039" id="10  039" >39</span>
 and they took it, and its king, and its villages: and he struck it with the edge of the sword, and they destroyed it, and every thing breathing in it; and they did not leave in it any one that was preserved: as they did to Chebron and her king, so they did to Dabir and her king.  <span class="verse" rel="v00610  040" id="10  040" >40</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="11  001">11  </span> And when Jabis the king of Asor heard, he sent to Jobab king of Maron, and to the king of Symoon, and to the king of Aziph,  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  002" id="11  002" >2</span>
 and to the kings who were by the great Sidon, to the hill country and to Araba opposite Keneroth, and to the plain, and to Phenaeddor,  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  003" id="11  003" >3</span>
 and to the Chananites on the coast eastward, and to the Amorites on the coast, and the Chettites, and the Pherezites, and the Jebusites in the mountain, and the Evites, and those dwelling under   mount   Aermon in the land Massyma.  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  004" id="11  004" >4</span>
 And they and their kings with them went forth, as the sand of the sea in multitude, and horses, and very many chariots.  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  005" id="11  005" >5</span>
 And all the kings assembled in person, and came to the same place, and encamped at the waters of Maron to war with Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  006" id="11  006" >6</span>
 And the Lord said to Joshua, Be not afraid of them, for to-morrow   at   this time I will put them to flight before Israel: you shall hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  007" id="11  007" >7</span>
 And Joshua and all the men of war came upon them  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to.  </span>  at the water of Maron suddenly; and they attacked them in the hill country.  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  008" id="11  008" >8</span>
 And the Lord delivered them into the power of Israel; and they struck them and pursued them to great Sidon, and to Maseron, and to the plains of Massoch eastward; and they destroyed them till there was not one of them left that survived.  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  009" id="11  009" >9</span>
 And Joshua did to them, as the Lord commanded him: he houghed their horses, and burned their chariots with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  010" id="11  010" >10</span>
 And Joshua returned at that time, and took Asor and her king; now Asor in former time was the chief of these kingdoms.  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  011" id="11  011" >11</span>
 And they killed with the sword all that breathed in it, and utterly destroyed them all, and there was no living thing left in it; and they burnt Asor with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  012" id="11  012" >12</span>
 And Joshua took all the cities of the kingdoms, and their kings, and killed them with the edge of the sword; and utterly killed them, as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded.  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  013" id="11  013" >13</span>
 But all the walled cities Israel burnt not; but Israel burnt Asor only.  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  014" id="11  014" >14</span>
 And the children of Israel took all its spoils to themselves; and they killed all the men with the edge of the sword, until he destroyed them; they left not one of them breathing.  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  015" id="11  015" >15</span>
 As the Lord commanded his servant Moses, even so Moses commanded Joshua; and so Joshua did, he transgressed no precept of all that Moses commanded him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  016" id="11  016" >16</span>
 And Joshua took all the hill country, and all the land of Nageb, and all the land of Gosom, and the plain country, and that toward the west, and the mountain of Israel and the low country by the mountain;  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  017" id="11  017" >17</span>
 from the mountain of Chelcha, and that which goes up to Seir, and as far as Balagad, and the plains of Libanus, under mount Aermon; and he took all their kings, and destroyed, and killed them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  018" id="11  018" >18</span>
 And for many days Joshua waged war with these kings.  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  019" id="11  019" >19</span>
 And there was no city which Israel took not; they took all in war.  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  020" id="11  020" >20</span>
 For it was of the Lord to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   strengthen.  </span>  harden their hearts to go forth to war against Israel, that they might be utterly destroyed, that mercy should not be granted to them, but that they should be utterly destroyed, as the Lord said to Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  021" id="11  021" >21</span>
 And Joshua came at that time, and utterly destroyed the Enakim out of the hill country, from Chebron and from Dabir, and from Anaboth, and from all the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. ישראל הר probably הר for רור a mountain, not a generation.  </span>  race of Israel, and from all the mountain of Juda with their cities; and Joshua utterly destroyed them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  022" id="11  022" >22</span>
 There was not   any one   left of the Enakim by the children of Israel, only there was left of them in Gaza, and in Gath, and in Aseldo.  <span class="verse" rel="v00611  023" id="11  023" >23</span>
 And Joshua took all the land, as the Lord commanded Moses; and Joshua gave them for an inheritance to Israel by division according to their tribes; and the land ceased from war.

 And this   is   the land that is left: the borders of the Phylistines, the Gesirite, and the Chananite,  <span class="verse" rel="v00613  003" id="13  003" >3</span>

 From Jordan to the great sea westward you shall give it   them  : the great sea shall be the boundary.

 They inherited according to their lots, as the Lord commanded by the hand of Joshua to the nine tribes and the half tribe, on the other side of Jordan.  <span class="verse" rel="v00614  003" id="14  003" >3</span>
 But to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00614  004" id="14  004" >4</span>
 For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasse and Ephraim; and there was none inheritance in the land given to the Levites, only cities to dwell in, and their suburbs separated for the cattle, and their cattle.  <span class="verse" rel="v00614  005" id="14  005" >5</span>

 And the children of Juda came to Joshua in Galgal, and Chaleb the   son   of Jephone the Kenezite said to him, You know the word that the Lord spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and you in Cades Barne.  <span class="verse" rel="v00614  007" id="14  007" >7</span>
 For I was forty years old when Moses the servant of God sent me out of Cades Barne to spy out the land; and I returned him an answer according to his mind.  <span class="verse" rel="v00614  008" id="14  008" >8</span>
 My brethren that went up with me turned away the heart of the people, but I  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   according to the Heb. idiom, 'fully followed.'  </span>  applied my self to follow the Lord my God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00614  009" id="14  009" >9</span>
 And Moses sware on that day, saying, The land on which you are gone up, it shall be your inheritance and your children's for ever, because you have applied yourself to follow the Lord our God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00614  010" id="14  010" >10</span>
 And now the Lord has kept me alive as he said: this   is   the forty-fifth year since the Lord spoke that word to Moses; and Israel journeyed in the wilderness; and now, behold, I   am   this day eighty-five years old.  <span class="verse" rel="v00614  011" id="14  011" >11</span>
 I am still strong this day, as when the Lord sent me: just so strong am I now to go out and to come in for war.  <span class="verse" rel="v00614  012" id="14  012" >12</span>
 And now I ask of you this mountain, as the Lord said in that day; for you heard this word on that day; and now the Enakim are there, cities great and strong: if then the Lord should be with me, I will utterly destroy them, as the Lord said to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00614  013" id="14  013" >13</span>
 And Joshua blessed him, and gave Chebron to Chaleb the son of Jephone the son of Kenez for an inheritance.  <span class="verse" rel="v00614  014" id="14  014" >14</span>
 Therefore Chebron became the inheritance of Chaleb the   son   of Jephone the Kenezite until this day, because he followed the commandment of the Lord God of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00614  015" id="14  015" >15</span>

 All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel,   were   forty-eight cities,  <span class="verse" rel="v00621  040" id="21  040" >40</span>
 and their suburbs round about these cities: a city and the suburbs round about the city to all these cities: and Joshua ceased dividing the land by their borders: and the children of Israel gave a portion to Joshua because of the commandment of the Lord: they gave him the city which he asked: they gave him Thamnasachar in mount Ephraim; and Joshua built the city, and lived in it: and Joshua took the knives of stone, wherewith he circumcised the children of Israel that were born in the desert by the way, and put them in Thamnasachar.  <span class="verse" rel="v00621  041" id="21  041" >41</span>
 So the Lord gave to Israel all the land which he sware to give to their fathers: and they inherited it, and lived in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00621  042" id="21  042" >42</span>
 And the Lord gave them rest round about, as he sware to their fathers: not one of all their enemies maintained his ground against them; the Lord delivered all their enemies into their hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v00621  043" id="21  043" >43</span>
 There failed not one of the good things which the Lord spoke to the children of Israel; all came to pass.

<p><span class="chapter" id="22  001">22  </span> Then Joshua called together the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse,  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  002" id="22  002" >2</span>
 and said to them, You° have heard all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, and you° have listened to my voice in all that he commanded you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  003" id="22  003" >3</span>
 You° have not deserted your brethren these many days: until this day you° have kept the commandment of the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  004" id="22  004" >4</span>
 And now the Lord our God has given our brethren rest, as he told them: now then return and depart to your homes, and to the land of your possession, which Moses gave you on the other side Jordan.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  005" id="22  005" >5</span>
 But take great heed to do the commands and the law, which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you to do; to love the Lord our God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his commands, and to cleave to him, and serve him with all your mind, and with all your soul.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  006" id="22  006" >6</span>
 And Joshua blessed them, and dismissed them; and they went to their homes.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  007" id="22  007" >7</span>
 And to   one   half the tribe of Manasse Moses gave a portion in the land of Basan, and to   the other   half Joshua gave a portion with his brethren on the other side of Jordan westward: and when Joshua sent them away to their homes, then he blessed them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  008" id="22  008" >8</span>
 And they departed with much wealth to their houses, and they divided the spoil of their enemies with their brethren; very much cattle, and silver, and gold, and iron, and much raiment.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  009" id="22  009" >9</span>
 So the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse, departed from the children of Israel in Selo in the land of Chanaan, to go away into Galaad, into the land of their possession, which they inherited by the command of the Lord, by the hand of Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  010" id="22  010" >10</span>
 And they came to Galaad of Jordan, which is in the land of Chanaan: and the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to look at.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  011" id="22  011" >11</span>
 And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse have built an altar at the borders of the land of Chanaan at Galaad of Jordan, on the opposite side to the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  012" id="22  012" >12</span>
 And all the children of Israel gathered together to Selo, so as to go up and fight against them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  013" id="22  013" >13</span>
 And the children of Israel sent to the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and to the sons of the half tribe of Manasse into the land of Galaad, both Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest,  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  014" id="22  014" >14</span>
 and ten of the chiefs with him;   there was   one chief of every household out of all the tribes of Israel; (the heads of families are the captains of thousands in Israel.)  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  015" id="22  015" >15</span>
 And they came to the sons of Ruben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   halves,   adj. q.d.   dimidios   viros </span>  half tribe of Manasse into the land of Galaad; and they spoke to them, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  016" id="22  016" >16</span>
 Thus says the whole congregation of the Lord, What   is   this transgression that you° have transgressed before the God of Israel, to turn away today from the Lord, in that you° have built for yourselves an altar, so that you° should be apostates from the Lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  017" id="22  017" >17</span>
 Is the sin of Phogor too little for you, whereas we have not been cleansed from it until this day, though there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  018" id="22  018" >18</span>
 And you° have this day revolted from the Lord; and it shall come to pass if you° revolt this day from the Lord, that to-morrow there shall be wrath upon all Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  019" id="22  019" >19</span>
 And now if the land of your possession   be too   little, cross over to the land of the possession of the Lord, where the tabernacle of the Lord dwells, and receive you° an inheritance among us; and do not become apostates from God, neither do you° apostatize from the Lord, because of your having built an altar apart from the altar of the Lord our God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  020" id="22  020" >20</span>
 Behold! did not Achar the   son   of Zara commit a trespass   taking   of the accursed thing, and there was wrath on the whole congregation of Israel? and he himself died alone in his own sin.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  021" id="22  021" >21</span>
 And the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse answered, and spoke to the captains of the thousands of Israel, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  022" id="22  022" >22</span>
 God   even   God is the Lord, and God   even   God himself knows, and Israel he shall know; if we have transgressed before the Lord by apostasy, let him not deliver us this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  023" id="22  023" >23</span>
 And if we have built to ourselves an altar, so as to apostatize from the Lord our God, so as to offer upon it a sacrifice of whole burnt offerings, so as to offer upon it a sacrifice of peace-offering, —the Lord shall require it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  024" id="22  024" >24</span>
 But we have done this for the sake of precaution   concerning this   thing, saying, Lest  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to-morrow.  </span>  hereafter your sons should say to our sons, What have you° to do with the Lord God of Israel?  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  025" id="22  025" >25</span>
 Whereas the Lord has set boundaries between us and you, even Jordan, and you° have no portion  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   of.  </span>  in the Lord: so your sons shall alienate our sons, that they should not worship the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  026" id="22  026" >26</span>
 And we  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   spoke.  </span>  gave orders to do thus, to build this altar, not for burnt offerings, nor for meat-offerings;  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  027" id="22  027" >27</span>
 but that this may be a witness between you and us, and between our posterity after us, that we may do service to the Lord before him, with our burnt offerings and our meat-offerings and our peace-offerings: so your sons shall not say to our sons, hereafter, You° have no portion in the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  028" id="22  028" >28</span>
 And we said, If ever it should come to pass that they should speak   so   to us, or to our posterity hereafter; then shall they say, Behold the likeness of the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for the sake of burnt offerings, nor for the sake of meat-offerings, but it is a witness between you and us, and between our sons.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  029" id="22  029" >29</span>
 Far be it from us therefore that we should turn away from the Lord this day so as to apostatize from the Lord, so as that we should build an altar for burnt offerings, and for  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        A double translation in Greek.  </span>  peace-offerings, besides the altar of the Lord which is before his tabernacle.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  030" id="22  030" >30</span>
 And Phinees the priest and all the chiefs of the congregation of Israel who were with him  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   having heard.  </span>  heard the words which the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse spoke; and it pleased them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  031" id="22  031" >31</span>
 And Phinees the priest said to the sons of Ruben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the half of the tribe of Manasse, To-day we know that the Lord   is   with us, because you° have not trespassed grievously against the Lord, and because you° have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  032" id="22  032" >32</span>
 So Phinees the priest and the princes departed from the children of Ruben, and from the children of Gad, and from the half tribe of Manasse out of Galaad into the land of Chanaan to the children of Israel; and reported the words to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  033" id="22  033" >33</span>
 And it pleased the children of Israel; and they spoke to the children of Israel, and blessed the God of the children of Israel, and told them to go up no more to war against  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   them.  </span>  the others to destroy the land of the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse: so they lived upon it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00622  034" id="22  034" >34</span>
 And Joshua gave a name to the altar of the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse; and said, It is a testimony in the midst of them, that the Lord is their God.  
<!-- 23   034 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="23  001">23  </span> And it came to pass after many days after the Lord had given Israel rest from all his enemies round about, that Joshua was old and advanced in  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   days.  </span>  years.  <span class="verse" rel="v00623  002" id="23  002" >2</span>
 And Joshua called together all the children of Israel, and their elders, and their chiefs, and their judges, and their officers; and said to them, I am old and advanced in years.  <span class="verse" rel="v00623  003" id="23  003" >3</span>
 And you° have seen all that the Lord our God has done to all these nations before us;   for it   is the Lord your God who has fought for you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00623  004" id="23  004" >4</span>
 See, that I have  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   cast upon you.  </span>  given to you these nations that are left to you by lots to your tribes, all the nations beginning at Jordan; and   some   I have destroyed; and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   he shall bound.  </span>  the boundaries shall be at the great sea westward.  <span class="verse" rel="v00623  005" id="23  005" >5</span>
 And the Lord our God, he shall destroy them before us, until they utterly perish; and he shall send against them the wild beasts, until he shall have utterly destroyed them and their kings from before you; and you° shall inherit their land, as the Lord our God said to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00623  006" id="23  006" >6</span>
 Do you° therefore strive diligently to observe and do all things written in the book of the law of Moses, that you° turn not to the right hand or to the left;  <span class="verse" rel="v00623  007" id="23  007" >7</span>
 that you° go not in among these nations that are left; and the names of their gods shall not be named among you, neither shall you° serve them, neither shall you° bow down to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00623  008" id="23  008" >8</span>
 But you° shall cleave to the Lord our God, as you° have done until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00623  009" id="23  009" >9</span>
 And the Lord shall destroy them before you,   even   great and strong nations; and no one has stood before us until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00623  010" id="23  010" >10</span>
 One of you has chased a thousand, for the Lord our God, he fought for you, as he said to us.  <span class="verse" rel="v00623  011" id="23  011" >11</span>
 And take you° great heed to love the Lord our God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00623  012" id="23  012" >12</span>
 For if you° shall turn aside and attach yourselves to these nations that are left with you, and make marriages with them, and become mingled with them and they with you,  <span class="verse" rel="v00623  013" id="23  013" >13</span>
 know that the Lord will no more destroy these nations from before you; and they will be to you snares and stumbling blocks, and nails in your heels, and darts in your eyes, until you° be destroyed from off this good land, which the Lord your God has given you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00623  014" id="23  014" >14</span>
 But I hasten to go the way   of death  , as all that are upon the earth also   do  : and you° know in your heart and in your soul, that not one word has fallen   to the ground   of all the words which the Lord our God has spoken respecting all that concerns us; there has not one of them failed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00623  015" id="23  015" >15</span>
 And it shall come to pass, that as all the good things are come upon us which the Lord God will bring upon you all the evil things, until he shall have destroyed you from off this good land, which the Lord has given you,  <span class="verse" rel="v00623  016" id="23  016" >16</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="24  001">24  </span> And Joshua gathered all the tribe of Israel to Selo, and convoked their elders, and their officers, and their judges, and set them before God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  002" id="24  002" >2</span>
 And Joshua said to all the people, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, Your fathers at first sojourned beyond the river,   even   Thara, the father of Abraam and the father of Nachor; and they served other gods.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  003" id="24  003" >3</span>
 And I took your father Abraam from the other side of the river, and I guided him  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in.  </span>  through all the land, and I multiplied his seed;  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  004" id="24  004" >4</span>
 and I gave to him Isaac, and to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau mount Seir for him to inherit: and Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt, and became there a great and populous and mighty nation: and the Egyptians afflicted them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  005" id="24  005" >5</span>
 And I struck Egypt with the wonders that I wrought among them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  006" id="24  006" >6</span>
 And afterwards   God   brought out our fathers from Egypt, and you° entered into the Red Sea; and the Egyptians pursued after our fathers with chariots and horses into the Red Sea.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  007" id="24  007" >7</span>
 And we cried aloud to the Lord; and he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   gave.  </span>  put a cloud and darkness between us and the Egyptians, and he brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen all that the Lord did in the land of Egypt; and you° were in the wilderness many days.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  008" id="24  008" >8</span>
 And he brought us into the land of the Amorites that lived beyond Jordan, and the Lord delivered them into our hands; and you° inherited their land, and utterly destroyed them from before you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  009" id="24  009" >9</span>
 And Balac, king of Moab, son of Sepphor, rose up, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   set himself in array.  </span>  made war against Israel, and sent and called Balaam to curse us.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  010" id="24  010" >10</span>
 But the Lord your God would not destroy you; and he greatly blessed us, and rescued us out of their hands, and delivered them   to us  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  011" id="24  011" >11</span>
 And you° crossed over Jordan, and came to Jericho; and the inhabitants of Jericho fought against us, the Amorite, and the Chananite, and the Pherezite, and the Evite, and the Jebusite, and the Chettite, and the Gergesite, and the Lord delivered them into our hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  012" id="24  012" >12</span>
 And he sent forth the hornet before you; and he drove them out from before you,   even   twelve kings of the Amorites, not with your sword, nor with your bow.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  013" id="24  013" >13</span>
 And he gave you a land on which you° did not labor, and cities which you° did not build, and you° were settled in them; and you°  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   shall eat.  </span>  eat   of   vineyards and olive yards which you° did not plant.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  014" id="24  014" >14</span>
 And now fear the Lord, and serve him in righteousness and justice; and remove the strange gods, which our fathers served beyond the river, and in Egypt; and serve the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  015" id="24  015" >15</span>
 But if it seem not good to you to serve the Lord, choose to yourselves this day whom you° will serve, whether the gods of your fathers that were on the other side of the river, or the gods of the Amorites, among whom you° dwell upon their land: but I and my house will serve the Lord, for he is holy.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  016" id="24  016" >16</span>
 And the people answered and said, Far be it from us to forsake the Lord, so as to serve other gods.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  017" id="24  017" >17</span>
 The Lord our God, he is God; he brought up us and our fathers from Egypt, and kept us in all the way wherein we walked, and among all the nations  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   whom we passed through them.

 And the Lord cast out the Amorite, and all the nations that inhabited the land from before us: yes, we will serve the Lord, for he is our God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  019" id="24  019" >19</span>
 And Joshua said to the people, Indeed you° will not be able to serve the Lord, for God is holy; and he being jealous will not forgive your sins and your transgressions.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  020" id="24  020" >20</span>
 Whenever you° shall forsake the Lord and serve other gods, then he shall come upon you and afflict you, and consume you,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   whereas on the contrary.  </span>  because he has done you good.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  021" id="24  021" >21</span>
 And the people said to Joshua, Nay, but we will serve the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  022" id="24  022" >22</span>
 And Joshua said to the people, You°   are   witnesses against yourselves, that you° have chosen the Lord to serve him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  023" id="24  023" >23</span>
 And now take away the strange gods that are among you, and set your heart right toward the Lord God of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  024" id="24  024" >24</span>
 And the people said to Joshua, We will serve the Lord, and we will listen to his voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  025" id="24  025" >25</span>
 So Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day, and gave them a law and an ordinance in Selo before the tabernacle of the God of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  026" id="24  026" >26</span>
 And he wrote these words in the book of the laws of God: and Joshua took a great stone, and set it up under the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   Properly a pine or turpentine tree. So chap. 17. 9.  </span>  oak before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  027" id="24  027" >27</span>
 And Joshua said to the people, Behold, this stone shall be among you for a witness, for it has heard all the words that have been spoken to it by the Lord; for he has spoken to you this day; and this   stone   shall be among you for a witness in the last days, whenever you° shall deal falsely with the Lord my God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  028" id="24  028" >28</span>
 And Joshua dismissed the people, and they went every man to his place.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  029" id="24  029" >29</span>
 And it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Naue the servant of the Lord died,   at the age   of a hundred and ten years.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  030" id="24  030" >30</span>
 And they buried him by the borders of his inheritance in Thamnasarach in the mount of Ephraim, northward of the mount of Galaad: there they put with him into the tomb in which they buried him, the knives of stone with which he circumcised the children of Israel in Galgala, when he brought them out of Egypt, as the Lord appointed them; and there they are to this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  031" id="24  031" >31</span>
 And Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   drew out the time with Joshua.

 And the children of Israel brought up the bones of Joseph out of Egypt, and buried   them   in Sicima, in the portion of the land which Jacob bought of the Amorites who lived in Sicima for a hundred ewe-lambs; and he gave it to Joseph for a portion.  <span class="verse" rel="v00624  033" id="24  033" >33</span>
 And it came to pass afterwards that Eleazar the high-priest the son of Aaron died, and was buried in Gabaar of Phinees his son, which he gave him in mount Ephraim. In that day the children of Israel took the ark of God, and carried it about among them; and Phinees exercised the priest's office in the room of Eleazar his father till he died, and he was buried in his own place Gabaar: but the children of Israel departed every one to their place, and to their own city: and the children of Israel worshipped Astarte, and Astaroth, and the gods of the nations round about them; and the Lord delivered them into the hands of Eglom king of Moab and he ruled over them eighteen years.
