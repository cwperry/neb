<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">T</span>he word of the Lord which came to Osee the son of Beeri, in the days of Ozias, and Joatham, and Achaz, and Ezekias, kings of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joas, king of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0281  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 The beginning of the word of the Lord by Osee. And the Lord said to Osee, Go, take to yourself a wife of fornication, and children of fornication: for the land will surely go a-whoring in departing from the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0281  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 So he went and took Gomer, daughter of Debelaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son.  <span class="verse" rel="v0281  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And the Lord said to him, Call his name Jezrael; for yet a little   while  , and I will avenge the blood of Jezrael on the house of Juda, and will make to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0281  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 And it shall be, in that day,   that   I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezrael.  <span class="verse" rel="v0281  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And he said to him, Call her name, Unpitied: for I will no more have mercy on the house of Israel, but will surely set myself in array against them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0281  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 But I will have mercy on the house of Juda, and will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them with bow, nor with sword, nor by war, nor by horses, nor by horsemen.  <span class="verse" rel="v0281  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 And she weaned Unpitied; and she conceived again, and bore a son.  <span class="verse" rel="v0281  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 And he said, Call his name, Not my people: for you° are not my people, and I am not your   God  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0281  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 Yet the number of the children of Israel was as the sand of the sea, which shall not be measured nor numbered: and it shall come to pass,   that   in the place where it was said to them, You° are not my people, even they shall be called the sons of the living God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0281  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 And the children of Juda shall be gathered, and the children of Israel together, and shall appoint themselves one head, and shall come up out of the land: for great   shall be   the day of Jezrael.  
<!-- 2   011 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> Say to your brother, My people, and to your sister, Pitied.  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband: and I will remove her fornication out of my presence, and her adultery from between her breasts:  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 that I may strip her naked, and make her again as she was at the day of her birth: and I will make her desolate, and make her as a dry land, and will kill her with thirst.  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they are children of fornication.  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 And their mother went a-whoring: she that bore them disgraced   them  : for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, and my garments, and my linen clothes, my oil and my necessaries.  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 Therefore, behold, I hedge up her way with thorns, and I will stop the ways, and she shall not find her path.  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 And she shall follow after her lovers, and shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: and she shall say, I will go, and return to my former husband; for it was better with me than now.  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 And she knew not that I gave her her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied silver to her: but she made silver and gold   images   for Baal.  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 Therefore I will return, and take away my corn in its season, and my wine in its time; and I will take away my raiment and my linen clothes, so that she shall not cover her nakedness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 And now I will expose her uncleanness before her lovers, and no one shall by any means deliver her out of my hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 And I will take away all her gladness, her feasts, and her festivals at the new moon, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 And I will utterly destroy her vines, and her fig-trees, all things of which she said, These are my hire which my lovers have given me: and I will make them a testimony, and the wild beasts of the field, and the birds of the sky, and the reptiles of the earth shall devour them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 And I will recompense on her the days of Baalim, wherein she sacrificed to them, and put on her ear-rings, and her necklaces, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 Therefore, behold, I   will   cause her to err, and will make her as desolate, and will speak comfortably to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 And I will giver her possessions from thence, and the valley of Achor to open her understanding: and she shall be afflicted there according to the days of her infancy, and according to the days of her coming up out of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 And it shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord,   that   she shall call me, My husband, and shall no longer call me Baalim.  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 And I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and their names shall be remembered no more at all.  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 And I will make for them in that day a covenant with the wild beasts of the field, and with the birds of the sky, and with the reptiles of the earth: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle from off the earth, and will cause you to dwell safely.  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 And I will betroth you to myself for ever; yes, I will betroth you to myself in righteousness, and in judgment, and in mercy, and in tender compassions;  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 and I will betroth you to myself in faithfulness: and you shall know the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 And it shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord, I will listen to the heaven, and it shall listen to the earth;  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 and the earth shall listen to the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall listen to Jezrael.  <span class="verse" rel="v0282  023" id="2  023" >23</span>
 And I will sow her to me on the earth; and will love her that was not loved, and will say to that which was not my people, You are my people; and they shall say, You are the Lord my God.  
<!-- 3   023 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> And the Lord said to me, Go yet, and love a woman that loves evil things, an adulteress, even as the Lord loves the children of Israel, and they have respect to strange gods, and love cakes of dried grapes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0283  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 So I hired   her   to myself for fifteen   pieces   of silver, and a homer of barley, and a flagon of wine.  <span class="verse" rel="v0283  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 And I said to her, You shall wait for me many days; and you shall not commit fornication, neither shall you be for   another   man; and I   will be   for you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0283  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an altar, and without a priesthood, and without manifestations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0283  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 And afterward shall the children of Israel return, and shall seek the Lord their God, and David their king; and shall be amazed at the Lord and at his goodness in the latter days.  
<!-- 4   005 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> Hear the word of the Lord, you° children of Israel: for the Lord   has   a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0284  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 Cursing, and lying, and murder, and theft, and adultery abound in the land, and they mingle blood with blood.  <span class="verse" rel="v0284  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 Therefore shall the land mourn, and shall be diminished with all that dwell in it, with the wild beasts of the field, and the reptiles of the earth, and with the birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea shall fail:  <span class="verse" rel="v0284  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 that neither any one may plead, nor any one reprove   another  ; but my people are as a priest spoken against.  <span class="verse" rel="v0284  005" id="4  005" >5</span>
 Therefore they shall fall by day, and the prophet with you shall fall: I have compared your mother to night.  <span class="verse" rel="v0284  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 My people are like as if they had no knowledge: because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you, that you shall not minister as priest to me: and   as   you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children.  <span class="verse" rel="v0284  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 According to their multitude, so they sinned against me: I will turn their glory into shame.  <span class="verse" rel="v0284  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 They will devour the sins of my people, and will set their hearts on their iniquities.  <span class="verse" rel="v0284  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 And the priest shall be as the people: and I will avenge on them their ways, and I will recompense to them their counsels.  <span class="verse" rel="v0284  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 And they shall eat, and shall not be satisfied: they have gone a-whoring, and shall by no means prosper: because they have left off to take heed to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0284  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 The heart of my people has gladly engaged in fornication and wine and strong drink.  <span class="verse" rel="v0284  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 They asked counsel by   means of   signs, and they reported answer to them by their staves: they have gone astray in a spirit of whoredom, and gone grievously a-whoring from their God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0284  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 They have sacrificed on the tops of the mountains, and on the hills they have sacrificed under the oak and poplar, and under the shady tree, because the shade was good: therefore your daughters shall go a-whoring, and your daughters-in-law shall commit adultery.  <span class="verse" rel="v0284  014" id="4  014" >14</span>
 And I will not visit upon your daughters when they shall commit fornication, nor your daughters-in-law when they shall commit adultery: for they themselves mingled themselves with harlots, and sacrificed with polluted ones, and the people that understood not entangled itself with a harlot.  <span class="verse" rel="v0284  015" id="4  015" >15</span>
 But you, O Israel, be not ignorant, and go you° not,   men of   Juda, to Galgala; and go not up to the house of On, and swear not by the living Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0284  016" id="4  016" >16</span>
 For Israel was maddened like a mad heifer: now the Lord will feed them as a lamb in a wide place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0284  017" id="4  017" >17</span>
 Ephraim, joined with idols, has laid stumbling blocks in his own way.  <span class="verse" rel="v0284  018" id="4  018" >18</span>
 He has chosen the Chananites: they have grievously gone a-whoring: they have loved dishonor through her insolence.  <span class="verse" rel="v0284  019" id="4  019" >19</span>
 You are a blast of wind in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their altars.  
<!-- 5   019 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> Hear these things, you° priests; and attend, O house of Israel; and listen, O house of the king; for the controversy is with you, because you° have been a snare in Scopia, and as a net spread on Itabyrium,  <span class="verse" rel="v0285  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 which they that hunt the prey have fixed: but I will correct you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0285  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not far from me: for now Ephraim has gone grievously a-whoring, Israel is defiled.  <span class="verse" rel="v0285  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 They have not framed their counsels to return to their God, for the spirit of fornication is in them, and they have not known the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0285  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 And the pride of Israel shall be brought low before his face; and Israel and Ephraim shall fall in their iniquities; and Judas also shall fall with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0285  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 They shall go with sheep and calves diligently to seek the Lord; but they shall not find him, for he has withdrawn himself from them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0285  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 For they have forsaken the Lord; for strange children have been born to them: now shall the cankerworm devour them and their heritages.  <span class="verse" rel="v0285  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 Blow you° the trumpet on the hills, sound aloud on the heights: proclaim in the house of On, Benjamin is amazed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0285  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 Ephraim has come to nothing in the days of reproof: in the tribes of Israel I have shown faithful   dealings  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0285  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 The princes of Juda became as they that removed the bounds: I will pour out upon them my fury as water.  <span class="verse" rel="v0285  011" id="5  011" >11</span>
 Ephraim altogether prevailed against his adversary, he trod judgment under foot, for he began to go after vanities.  <span class="verse" rel="v0285  012" id="5  012" >12</span>
 Therefore I   will be   as consternation to Ephraim, and as a goad to the house of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v0285  013" id="5  013" >13</span>
 And Ephraim saw his disease, and Judas his pain; then Ephraim went to the Assyrians, and sent ambassadors to king Jarim: but he could not heal you, and your pain shall in nowise cease from you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0285  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 Therefore I am as a panther to Ephraim, and as a lion to the house of Juda: and I will tear, and go away; and I will take, and there shall be none to deliver.  <span class="verse" rel="v0285  015" id="5  015" >15</span>
 I will go and return to my place, until they are brought to nothing, and   then   shall they seek my face.

<p><span class="chapter" id="6  001">6  </span> In their affliction they will seek me early, saying, Let us go, and return to the Lord our God; for he has torn, and will heal us;  <span class="verse" rel="v0286  002" id="6  002" >2</span>
 he will strike, and bind us up.  <span class="verse" rel="v0286  003" id="6  003" >3</span>
 After two days he will heal us: in the third day we shall arise, and live before him, and shall know   him  :  <span class="verse" rel="v0286  004" id="6  004" >4</span>
 let us follow on to know the Lord: we shall find him ready as the morning, and he will come to us as the early and latter rain to the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0286  005" id="6  005" >5</span>
 What shall I do to you, Ephraim? What shall I do to you, Juda? whereas your mercy is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew that goes away.  <span class="verse" rel="v0286  006" id="6  006" >6</span>
 Therefore have I mown down your prophets; I have slain them with the word of my mouth: and my judgment shall go forth as the light.  <span class="verse" rel="v0286  007" id="6  007" >7</span>
 For I will   have   mercy rather than sacrifice, and the knowledge of God rather than whole burnt offerings.  <span class="verse" rel="v0286  008" id="6  008" >8</span>
 But they are as a man transgressing a covenant:  <span class="verse" rel="v0286  009" id="6  009" >9</span>
 there the city Galaad despised me, working vanity, troubling water.  <span class="verse" rel="v0286  010" id="6  010" >10</span>
 And your strength   is that   of a robber: the priests have hid the way, they have murdered   the people of   Sicima; for they have wrought iniquity in the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0286  011" id="6  011" >11</span>
 I have seen horrible   things   there,   even   the fornication of Ephraim: Israel and Juda are defiled;  <span class="verse" rel="v0286  012" id="6  012" >12</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="7  001">7  </span> When I have healed Israel, then shall the iniquity of Ephraim be revealed, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they have wrought falsehood: and a thief shall come in to him,   even   a robber spoiling in his way;  <span class="verse" rel="v0287  002" id="7  002" >2</span>
 that they may concert together as   men   singing in their heart: I remember all their wickedness: now have their own counsels compassed them about; they came before my face.  <span class="verse" rel="v0287  003" id="7  003" >3</span>
 They gladdened kings with their wickedness, and princes with their lies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0287  004" id="7  004" >4</span>
 They are all adulterers, as an oven glowing with flame for hot-baking, on account of the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened.  <span class="verse" rel="v0287  005" id="7  005" >5</span>
    In   the days of our kings, the princes began to be inflamed with wine: he stretched out his hand with pestilent fellows.  <span class="verse" rel="v0287  006" id="7  006" >6</span>
 Therefore their hearts are inflamed as an oven, while they rage all the night: Ephraim is satisfied with sleep; the morning is come; he is burnt up as a flame of fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v0287  007" id="7  007" >7</span>
 They are all heated like an oven, and have devoured their judges: all their kings are fallen; there was not among them one that called on me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0287  008" id="7  008" >8</span>
 Ephraim is mixed among his people; Ephraim became a cake not turned.  <span class="verse" rel="v0287  009" id="7  009" >9</span>
 Strangers devoured his strength, and he knew   it   not; and grey hairs came upon him, and he knew   it   not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0287  010" id="7  010" >10</span>
 And the pride of Israel shall be brought down before his face: yet they have not returned to the Lord their God, neither have they diligently sought him for all this.  <span class="verse" rel="v0287  011" id="7  011" >11</span>
 And Ephraim was as a silly dove, not having a heart: he called to Egypt, and they went to the Assyrians.  <span class="verse" rel="v0287  012" id="7  012" >12</span>
 Whenever they shall go, I will cast my net upon them; I will bring them down as the birds of the sky, I will chasten them with the rumor of their   coming   affliction.  <span class="verse" rel="v0287  013" id="7  013" >13</span>
 Woe to them! for they have started aside from me: they are cowards; for they have sinned against me: yet I redeemed them, but they spoke falsehoods against me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0287  014" id="7  014" >14</span>
 And their hearts did not cry to me, but they howled on their beds: they pined for oil and wine.  <span class="verse" rel="v0287  015" id="7  015" >15</span>
 They were instructed by me, and I strengthened their arms; and they devised evils against me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0287  016" id="7  016" >16</span>
 They turned aside to that which is not, they became as a bent bow: their princes shall fall by the sword, by reason of the unbridled state of their tongue: this is their setting at nothing in the land of Egypt.

<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span>    He shall come   into their midst as the land, as an eagle against the house of the Lord, because they have transgressed my covenant, and have sinned against my law.  <span class="verse" rel="v0288  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 They shall soon cry out to me,   saying  , O God, we know you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0288  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 For Israel has turned away from good things; they have pursued an enemy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0288  004" id="8  004" >4</span>
 They have made kings for themselves, but not by me: they have ruled, but they did not make it known to me:   of   their silver and their gold they have made images to themselves, that they might be destroyed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0288  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 Cast off your calf, O Samaria; my anger is kindled against them: how long will they be unable to purge themselves in Israel?  <span class="verse" rel="v0288  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 Whereas the workman made it, and it is not God; therefore your calf, Samaria, was a deceiver:  <span class="verse" rel="v0288  007" id="8  007" >7</span>
 for they sowed blighted   seed  , and their destruction shall await them, a sheaf of corn that avails not to make meal; and even if it should produce it, strangers shall devour it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0288  008" id="8  008" >8</span>
 Israel is swallowed up: now is he become among the nations as a worthless vessel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0288  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 For they have gone up to the Assyrians: Ephraim has been strengthened against himself; they loved gifts.  <span class="verse" rel="v0288  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 Therefore shall they be delivered to the nations: now I will receive them, and they shall cease a little to anoint a king and princes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0288  011" id="8  011" >11</span>
 Because Ephraim has multiplied altars,   his   beloved altars are become sins to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0288  012" id="8  012" >12</span>
 I will write down a multitude   of commands   for him; but his statutes are accounted strange things,   even   the beloved altars.  <span class="verse" rel="v0288  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 For if they should offer a sacrifice, and eat flesh, the lord will not accept them: now will he remember their iniquities, and will take vengeance on their sins: they have returned to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things among the Assyrians.  <span class="verse" rel="v0288  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 And Israel has forgotten him that made him, and they have built fanes, and Juda has multiplied walled cities: but I will send fire on his cities, and it shall devour their foundations.

<p><span class="chapter" id="9  001">9  </span> Rejoice not, O Israel, neither make merry, as   other   nations: for you have gone a-whoring from your God; you have loved gifts upon every threshing floor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0289  002" id="9  002" >2</span>
 The threshing floor and wine-press knew them not, and the wine disappointed them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0289  003" id="9  003" >3</span>
 They lived not in the Lord's land: Ephraim lived in Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things among the Assyrians.  <span class="verse" rel="v0289  004" id="9  004" >4</span>
 They have not offered wine to the Lord, neither have their sacrifices been sweet to him,   but   as the bread of mourning to them; all that eat them shall be defiled; for their bread for their soul shall not enter into the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0289  005" id="9  005" >5</span>
 What will you° do in the day of the general assembly, and in the day of the feast of the Lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v0289  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
 Therefore, behold, they go forth from the trouble of Egypt, and Memphis shall receive them, and Machmas shall bury them:   as for   their silver, destruction shall inherit it; thorns   shall be   in their tents.  <span class="verse" rel="v0289  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 The days of vengeance are come, the days of your recompense are come; and Israel shall be afflicted as the prophet that is mad, as a man deranged: by reason of the multitude of your iniquities your madness has abounded.  <span class="verse" rel="v0289  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 The watchman of Ephraim   was   with God: the prophet is a crooked snare in all his ways: they have established madness in the house of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0289  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 They have corrupted themselves according to the days of the hill: he will remember their iniquities, he will take vengeance on their sins.  <span class="verse" rel="v0289  010" id="9  010" >10</span>
 I found Israel as grapes in the wilderness, and I saw their fathers as an early watchman in a fig tree: they went in to Beel-phegor, and were shamefully estranged, and the abominable became as the beloved.  <span class="verse" rel="v0289  011" id="9  011" >11</span>
 Ephraim has flown away as a bird; their glories from the birth, and the travail, and the conception.  <span class="verse" rel="v0289  012" id="9  012" >12</span>
 For even if they should rear their children, yet shall they be utterly bereaved: therefore also there is woe to them,   though   my flesh is of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0289  013" id="9  013" >13</span>
 Ephraim,   even   as I saw, gave their children for a prey; yes, Ephraim   was ready   to bring out his children to slaughter.  <span class="verse" rel="v0289  014" id="9  014" >14</span>
 Give them, O Lord: what will you give them? a miscarrying womb, and dry breasts.  <span class="verse" rel="v0289  015" id="9  015" >15</span>
 All their wickedness is in Galgal: for there I hated them: because of the wickedness of their practices, I will cast them out of my house, I will not love them any more: all their princes are disobedient.  <span class="verse" rel="v0289  016" id="9  016" >16</span>
 Ephraim is sick, he is dried up at his roots, he shall in no wise any more bear fruit: therefore even if they should beget   children  , I will kill the desired   fruit   of their womb.  <span class="verse" rel="v0289  017" id="9  017" >17</span>
 God shall reject them, because they have not listened to him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.

<p><span class="chapter" id="10  001">10  </span> Israel is a vine with goodly branches, her fruit is abundant: according to the multitude of her fruits she has multiplied   her   altars; according to the wealth of his land, he has set up pillars.  <span class="verse" rel="v02810  002" id="10  002" >2</span>
 They have divided their hearts; now shall they be utterly destroyed: he shall dig down their altars, their pillars shall mourn.  <span class="verse" rel="v02810  003" id="10  003" >3</span>
 Because now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the Lord:  <span class="verse" rel="v02810  004" id="10  004" >4</span>
 and what should a king do for us, speaking false professions   as his   words? he will make a covenant: judgment shall spring up as a weed on the soil of the field.  <span class="verse" rel="v02810  005" id="10  005" >5</span>
 The inhabitants of Samaria shall dwell near the calf of the house of On; for the people of it mourned for it: and as they provoked him, they shall rejoice at his glory, because he has departed from them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02810  006" id="10  006" >6</span>

 Samaria has cast off her king as a twig on the surface of the water.  <span class="verse" rel="v02810  008" id="10  008" >8</span>
 And the altars of On, the sins of Israel, shall be taken away: thorns and thistles shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.  <span class="verse" rel="v02810  009" id="10  009" >9</span>

 Ephraim is a heifer taught to love victory, but I will come upon the fair part of her neck: I will mount Ephraim; I will pass over Juda in silence; Jacob shall prevail against him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02810  012" id="10  012" >12</span>
 Sow to yourselves for righteousness, gather in for the fruit of life: light you° for yourselves the light of knowledge; seek the Lord till the fruits of righteousness come upon you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02810  013" id="10  013" >13</span>

 As I called them, so they departed from my presence: they sacrificed to Baalim, and burnt incense to graven images.  <span class="verse" rel="v02811  003" id="11  003" >3</span>

 Return, O Israel, to the Lord your God; for the people have fallen through your iniquities.  <span class="verse" rel="v02814  003" id="14  003" >3</span>
 Take with you words, and turn to the Lord your God: speak to him, that you° may not receive   the reward of   unrighteousness, but that you° may receive good things: and we will render in return the fruit of our lips.  <span class="verse" rel="v02814  004" id="14  004" >4</span>
 Assur shall never save us; we will not mount on horseback; we will no longer say to the works of our hands, Our gods. He who is in you shall pity the orphan.  <span class="verse" rel="v02814  005" id="14  005" >5</span>
 I will restore their dwellings, I will love them truly: for he has turned away my wrath from him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02814  006" id="14  006" >6</span>
 I will be as dew to Israel: he shall bloom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Libanus.  <span class="verse" rel="v02814  007" id="14  007" >7</span>
 His branches shall spread, and he shall be as a fruitful olive, and his smell shall be as   the smell   of Libanus.  <span class="verse" rel="v02814  008" id="14  008" >8</span>
 They shall return, and dwell under his shadow: they shall live and be satisfied with corn, and he shall flower as a vine: his memorial shall be to Ephraim as the wine of Libanus.  <span class="verse" rel="v02814  009" id="14  009" >9</span>
 What   has   he to do any more with idols? I have afflicted him, and I will strengthen him: I am as a leafy juniper tree. From me is your fruit found.  <span class="verse" rel="v02814  010" id="14  010" >10</span>
 Who is wise, and will understand these things? or prudent, and will know them? for the ways of the Lord are straight, and the righteous shall walk in them: but the ungodly shall fall therein.
