 If   any   man of you shall bring gifts to the Lord, you° shall bring your gifts of the cattle and of the oxen and of the sheep.  <span class="verse" rel="v0031  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 If his gift be a whole burnt offering, he shall bring an unblemished male of the herd to the door of the tabernacle of witness, he shall bring it as acceptable before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0031  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And he shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering as a thing acceptable for him, to make atonement for him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0031  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 And they shall kill the calf before the Lord; and the sons of Aaron the priests shall bring the blood, and they shall pour the blood round about on the altar, which   is   at the doors of the tabernacle of witness.  <span class="verse" rel="v0031  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 And having flayed the whole burnt offering, they shall divide it by its limbs.  <span class="verse" rel="v0031  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 And the sons of Aaron the priests shall put fire on the altar, and shall pile wood on the fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v0031  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 And the sons of Aaron the priests shall pile up the divided parts, and the head, and the fat on the wood on the fire,   the wood   which is on the altar.  <span class="verse" rel="v0031  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 And the entrails and the feet they shall wash in water, and the priests shall put all on the altar: it is a burnt offering, a sacrifice, a smell of sweet savor to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0031  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 And if his gift   be   of the sheep to the Lord, or of the lambs, or of the kids for whole burnt offerings, he shall bring it a male without blemish.  <span class="verse" rel="v0031  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 And he shall lay his hand on its head; and they shall kill it by the side of the altar, toward the north before the Lord, and the sons of Aaron the priests shall pour its blood on the altar round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v0031  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 And they shall divide it by its limbs, and its head and its fat, and the priests shall pile them up on the wood which is on the fire, on the altar.  <span class="verse" rel="v0031  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 And they shall wash the entrails and the feet with water, and the priest shall bring all the   parts   and put them on the altar: it is a burnt offering, a sacrifice, a smell of sweet savor to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0031  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 And if he bring his gift, a burnt offering to the Lord, of birds, then shall he bring his gift of doves or pigeons.  <span class="verse" rel="v0031  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 And the priest shall bring it to the altar, and shall wring off its head; and the priest shall put it on the altar, and shall wring out the blood at the bottom of the altar.  <span class="verse" rel="v0031  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 And he shall take away the crop with the feathers, and shall cast it forth by the altar toward the east to the place of the ashes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0031  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 And he shall break it off from the wings and shall not separate it, and the priest shall put it on the altar on the wood which is on the fire: it is a burnt offering, a sacrifice, a sweet smelling savor to the Lord.

 And he shall bring it to the priests the sons of Aaron: and having taken from it a handful of the fine flour with the oil, and all its frankincense, then the priest shall put the memorial of it on the altar:   it is   a sacrifice, an odour of sweet savor to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0032  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 And the remainder of the sacrifice shall be for Aaron and his sons, a most holy portion from the sacrifices of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0032  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 And if he bring as a gift a sacrifice baked from the oven, a gift to the Lord of fine flour,   he shall bring   unleavened bread kneaded with oil, and unleavened cakes anointed with oil.  <span class="verse" rel="v0032  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 And if your gift   be   a sacrifice from a pan, it is fine flour mingled with oil, unleavened   offerings  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0032  006" id="2  006" >6</span>

 And the priest shall approach the altar, and shall take away from the sacrifice a memorial of it, and the priest shall place it on the altar: a burnt offering, a smell of sweet savor to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0032  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 And that which is left of the sacrifice   shall be   for Aaron and his sons, most holy from the burnt offerings of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0032  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 You° shall not leaven any sacrifice which you° shall bring to the Lord; for   as to   any leaven, or any honey, you° shall not bring of it to offer a gift to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0032  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 You° shall bring them in the way of fruits to the Lord, but they shall not be offered on the altar for a sweet smelling savor to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0032  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 And every gift of your sacrifice shall be seasoned with salt; omit not the salt of the covenant of the Lord from your sacrifices: on every gift of yours you° shall offer salt to the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0032  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 And if you would offer a sacrifice of first fruits to the Lord,   it shall be   new grains ground   and   roasted for the Lord; so shall you bring the sacrifice of the first fruits.  <span class="verse" rel="v0032  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 And you shall pour oil upon it, and shall put frankincense on it: it is a sacrifice.  <span class="verse" rel="v0032  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 And the priest shall offer the memorial of it   taken   from the grains with the oil, and all its frankincense: it is a burnt offering to the Lord.

 and sprinkled of it seven times on the altar; and anointed the altar, and hallowed it, and all things on it, and the laver, and its foot, and sanctified them; and anointed the tabernacle and all its furniture, and hallowed it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  012" id="8  012" >12</span>

 And Moses brought near the calf for the sin-offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the calf of the sin-offering.  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  015" id="8  015" >15</span>
 And he killed it; and Moses took of the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar round about with his finger; and he purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement upon it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  016" id="8  016" >16</span>
 And Moses took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the lobe on the liver, and both the kidneys, and the fat that was upon them, and Moses offered them on the altar.  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  017" id="8  017" >17</span>
 But the calf, and his hide, and his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp, as the Lord commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  018" id="8  018" >18</span>
 And Moses brought near the ram for a whole burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. And Moses killed the ram: and Moses poured the blood on the altar round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  019" id="8  019" >19</span>
 And he divided the ram by its limbs, and Moses offered the head, and the limbs, and the fat; and he washed the belly and the feet with water.  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  020" id="8  020" >20</span>
 And Moses offered up the whole ram on the altar: it is a whole burnt offering for a sweet smelling savor; it is a burnt offering to the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  021" id="8  021" >21</span>
 And Moses brought the second ram, the ram of consecration, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram, and   he   killed him;  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  022" id="8  022" >22</span>
 and Moses took of his blood, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  023" id="8  023" >23</span>
 And Moses brought near the sons of Aaron; and Moses put of the blood on the tips of their right ears, and on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the great toes of their right feet, and Moses poured out the blood on the altar round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  024" id="8  024" >24</span>

 And from the basket of consecration, which was before the Lord, he also took one unleavened loaf, and one loaf made with oil, and one cake; and put   them   upon the fat, and the right shoulder:  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  026" id="8  026" >26</span>
 and put them all on the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and offered them up for a wave-offering before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  027" id="8  027" >27</span>
 And Moses took them at their hands, and Moses offered them on the altar, on the whole burnt offering of consecration, which is a smell of sweet savor: it is a burnt offering to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  028" id="8  028" >28</span>
 And Moses took the breast, and separated it for a heave-offering before the Lord, from the ram of consecration; and it became Moses' portion, as the Lord commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  029" id="8  029" >29</span>
 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood that was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, and on his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  030" id="8  030" >30</span>
 And he sanctified Aaron and his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  031" id="8  031" >31</span>
 And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh in the tent of the tabernacle of witness in the holy place; and there you° shall eat it and the loaves in the basket of consecration, as it has been appointed me,   the Lord   saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  032" id="8  032" >32</span>
 And that which is left of the flesh and of the loaves burn you° with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  033" id="8  033" >33</span>
 And you° shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of witness for seven days, until the day be fulfilled, the day of your consecration; for in seven days shall he consecrate you,  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  034" id="8  034" >34</span>
 as he did in this day on which the Lord commanded me to do so, to make an atonement for you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  035" id="8  035" >35</span>
 And you° shall remain seven days at the door of the tabernacle of witness, day and night; you° shall observe the ordinances of the Lord, that you° die not; for so has the Lord God commanded me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0038  036" id="8  036" >36</span>
 And Aaron and his sons performed all these commands which the Lord commanded Moses.

 And they took as Moses commanded them before the tabernacle of witness, and all the congregation drew near, and they stood before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0039  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
 And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord has spoken; do   it  , and the glory of the Lord shall appear among you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0039  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 And Moses said to Aaron, Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin-offering, and your whole burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for your house; and offer the gifts of the people, and make atonement for them, as the Lord commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0039  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 And Aaron drew near to the altar, and killed the calf of his sin-offering.  <span class="verse" rel="v0039  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger into the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and he poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar.  <span class="verse" rel="v0039  010" id="9  010" >10</span>

 And he brought the whole burnt offering, and offered it in due form.  <span class="verse" rel="v0039  017" id="9  017" >17</span>
 And he brought the sacrifice and filled his hands with it, and laid it on the altar, besides the morning whole burnt offering.  <span class="verse" rel="v0039  018" id="9  018" >18</span>

 And Aaron separated the breast and the right shoulder as a choice-offering before the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0039  022" id="9  022" >22</span>
 And Aaron lifted up his hands on the people and blessed them; and after he had offered the sin-offering, and the whole burnt offerings, and the peace-offerings, he came down.  <span class="verse" rel="v0039  023" id="9  023" >23</span>
 And Moses and Aaron entered into the tabernacle of witness. And they came out and blessed all the people, and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0039  024" id="9  024" >24</span>
 And fire came forth from the Lord, and devoured the offerings on the altar, both the whole burnt offerings and the fat; and all the people saw, and were amazed, and fell upon their faces.

<p><span class="chapter" id="10  001">10  </span> And the two sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abiud, took each his censer, and put fire therein, and threw incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which the Lord did not command them,  <span class="verse" rel="v00310  002" id="10  002" >2</span>
 and fire came forth from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00310  003" id="10  003" >3</span>
 And Moses said to Aaron, This is the thing which the Lord spoke, saying, I will be sanctified among them that draw night to me, and I will be glorified in the whole congregation; and Aaron was pricked   in his heart  .  <span class="verse" rel="v00310  004" id="10  004" >4</span>
 And Moses called Misadae, and Elisaphan, sons of Oziel, sons of the brother of Aaron's father, and said to them, Draw near and take your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.  <span class="verse" rel="v00310  005" id="10  005" >5</span>
 And they came near and took them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses said.  <span class="verse" rel="v00310  006" id="10  006" >6</span>
 And Moses said to Aaron, and Eleazar and Ithamar his sons that were left, You° shall not make bare your heads, and you° shall not tear your garments; that you° die not, and   so   there should be wrath on all the congregation: but your brethren,   even   all the house of Israel, shall lament for the burning, with which they were burnt by the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00310  007" id="10  007" >7</span>
 And you° shall not go forth from the door of the tabernacle of witness, that you° die not; for the Lord's anointing oil   is   upon you: and they did according to the word of Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v00310  008" id="10  008" >8</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Aaron, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00310  009" id="10  009" >9</span>
 You° shall not drink wine nor strong drink, you and your sons with you, whenever you° enter into the tabernacle of witness, or when you° approach the altar, so shall you° not die;   it is   a perpetual statute for your generations,  <span class="verse" rel="v00310  010" id="10  010" >10</span>
 to distinguish between sacred and profane, and between clean and unclean,  <span class="verse" rel="v00310  011" id="10  011" >11</span>
 and to teach the children of Israel all the statutes, which the Lord spoke to them by Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v00310  012" id="10  012" >12</span>
 And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who survived, Take the sacrifice that is left of the burnt offerings of the Lord, and you° shall eat unleavened bread by the altar: it is most holy.  <span class="verse" rel="v00310  013" id="10  013" >13</span>
 And you° shall eat it in the holy place; for this is a statute for you and a statute for your sons, of the burnt offerings to the Lord; for so it has been commanded me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00310  014" id="10  014" >14</span>
 And you° shall eat the breast of separation, and the shoulder of the choice-offering in the holy place, you and your sons and your house with you; for it has been given as an ordinance for you and an ordinance for your sons, of the sacrifices of peace-offering of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00310  015" id="10  015" >15</span>
 They shall bring the shoulder of the choice-offering, and the breast of the separation upon the burnt offerings of the fat, to separate for a separation before the Lord; and it shall be a perpetual ordinance for you and your sons and your daughters with you, as the Lord commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" rel="v00310  016" id="10  016" >16</span>
 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, but it had been consumed by fire; and Moses was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar the sons of Aaron that were left, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00310  017" id="10  017" >17</span>
 Why did you° not eat the sin-offering in the holy place? for because it is most holy he has given you this to eat, that you° might take away the sin of the congregation, and make atonement for them before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00310  018" id="10  018" >18</span>
 For the blood of it was not brought into the holy place: you° shall eat it within, before   the Lord  , as the Lord commanded me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00310  019" id="10  019" >19</span>
 And Aaron spoke to Moses, saying, If they have brought near today their sin-offerings, and their whole burnt offerings before the Lord, and these events have happened to me, and   yet   I should eat today of the sin-offerings, would it be pleasing to the Lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v00310  020" id="10  020" >20</span>

 And you° shall not defile your souls with any of the reptiles that creep upon the earth, and you° shall not be polluted with them, and you° shall not be unclean by them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00311  044" id="11  044" >44</span>
 For I am the Lord your God; and you° shall be sanctified, and you° shall be holy, because I the Lord your God am holy; and you° shall not defile your souls with any of the reptiles creeping upon the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v00311  045" id="11  045" >45</span>
 For I am the Lord who brought you up out of the land of Egypt to be your God; and you° shall be holy, for I the Lord am holy.  <span class="verse" rel="v00311  046" id="11  046" >46</span>
 This is the law concerning beasts and birds and every living creature moving in the water, and every living creature creeping on the earth;  <span class="verse" rel="v00311  047" id="11  047" >47</span>
 to distinguish between the unclean and the clean; and between those that bring forth alive, such as should be eaten, and those that bring forth alive, such as should not be eaten.

 Speak to the children of Israel, and you shall say to them, Whatsoever woman shall have conceived and born a male child shall be unclean seven days, she shall be unclean according to the days of separation for her monthly courses.  <span class="verse" rel="v00312  003" id="12  003" >3</span>
 And on the eighth day she shall circumcise the flesh of his foreskin.  <span class="verse" rel="v00312  004" id="12  004" >4</span>
 And for thirty-three days she shall continue in her unclean blood; she shall touch nothing holy, and shall not enter the sanctuary, until the days of her purification be fulfilled.  <span class="verse" rel="v00312  005" id="12  005" >5</span>
 But if she should have born a female child, then she shall be unclean twice seven days, according to the time of her monthly courses; and for sixty-six days shall she remain in her unclean blood.  <span class="verse" rel="v00312  006" id="12  006" >6</span>
 And when the days of her purification shall have been fulfilled for a son or a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of a year old without blemish for a whole burnt offering, and a young pigeon or turtle-dove for a sin-offering to the door of the tabernacle of witness, to the priest.  <span class="verse" rel="v00312  007" id="12  007" >7</span>

 And if she can’t afford a lamb, then shall she take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a whole burnt offering, and one for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be purified.

 If any man should have in the skin of his flesh a bright clear spot, and there should be in the skin of his flesh a plague of leprosy, he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  003" id="13  003" >3</span>
 And the priest shall view the spot in the skin of his flesh; and   if   the hair in the spot be changed   to   white, and the appearance of the spot be below the skin of the flesh, it is a plague of leprosy; and the priest shall look upon it, and pronounce him unclean.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  004" id="13  004" >4</span>
 But if the spot be clear and white in the skin of his flesh, yet the appearance of it be not deep below the skin, and its hair have not changed   itself for   white hair, but it is dark, then the priest shall separate   him that has   the spot seven days;  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  005" id="13  005" >5</span>
 and the priest shall look on the spot the seventh day; and, behold,   if   the spot remains before him,   if   the spot has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall separate him the second time seven days.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  006" id="13  006" >6</span>
 And the priest shall look upon him the second time on the seventh day; and, behold,   if   the spot be dark,   and   the spot have not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is a   mere   mark, and the man shall wash his garments and be clean.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  007" id="13  007" >7</span>
 But if the bright spot should have changed and spread in the skin, after the priest has seen him for the purpose of purifying him, then shall he appear the second time to the priest,  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  008" id="13  008" >8</span>
 and the priest shall look upon him; and, behold,   if   the mark have spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  009" id="13  009" >9</span>
 And if a man have a plague of leprosy, then he shall come to the priest;  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  010" id="13  010" >10</span>
 and the priest shall look, and, behold, if it is a white spot in the skin, and it has changed the hair to white, and   there be   some of the sound part of the quick flesh in the sore—  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  011" id="13  011" >11</span>
 it is a leprosy waxing old in the skin of the flesh; and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall separate him, because he is unclean.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  012" id="13  012" >12</span>
 And if the leprosy should have come out very evidently in the skin, and the leprosy should cover all the skin of the patient from the head to the feet, wherever the priest shall look;  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  013" id="13  013" >13</span>
 then the priest shall look, and, behold, the leprosy has covered all the skin of the flesh; and the priest shall pronounce him clean of the plague, because it has changed all to white, it is clean.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  014" id="13  014" >14</span>
 But on whatever day the quick flesh shall appear on him, he shall be pronounced unclean.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  015" id="13  015" >15</span>
 And the priest shall look upon the sound flesh, and the sound flesh shall prove him to be unclean; for it is unclean, it is a leprosy.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  016" id="13  016" >16</span>
 But if the sound flesh be restored and changed   to   white, then shall he come to the priest;  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  017" id="13  017" >17</span>
 and the priest shall see   him  , and, behold,   if   the plague is turned white, then the priest shall pronounce the patient clean: he is clean.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  018" id="13  018" >18</span>
 And if the flesh should have become an ulcer in his skin, and should be healed,  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  019" id="13  019" >19</span>
 and there should be in the place of the ulcer a white sore, or   one   looking white and bright, or fiery, and it shall be seen by the priest;  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  020" id="13  020" >20</span>
 then the priest shall look, and, behold, if the appearance be beneath the skin, and its hair has changed to white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; because it is a leprosy, it has broken out in the ulcer.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  021" id="13  021" >21</span>
 But if the priest look, and behold there is no white hair on it, and it be not below the skin of the flesh, and it be dark-colored; then the priest shall separate him seven days.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  022" id="13  022" >22</span>
 But if it manifestly spread over the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy; it has broken out in the ulcer.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  023" id="13  023" >23</span>
 But if the bright spot should remain in its place and not spread, it is the scar of the ulcer; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  024" id="13  024" >24</span>
 And if the flesh be in his skin   in a state of   fiery inflammation, and there should be in his skin the part which is healed of the inflammation, bright, clear, and white, suffused with red or very white;  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  025" id="13  025" >25</span>
 then the priest shall look upon him, and, behold,   if   the hair being white is changed to a bright color, and its appearance is lower than the skin, it is a leprosy; it has broken out in the inflammation, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  026" id="13  026" >26</span>
 But if the priest should look, and, behold, there is not in the bright spot any white hair, and it should not be lower than the skin, and it should be dark, then the priest shall separate him seven days.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  027" id="13  027" >27</span>
 And the priest shall look upon him on the seventh day; and if the spot be much spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy, it has broken out in the ulcer.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  028" id="13  028" >28</span>
 But if the bright spot remain stationary, and be not spread in the skin, but   the sore   should be dark, it is a scar of inflammation; and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is the mark of the inflammation.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  029" id="13  029" >29</span>
 And if a man or a woman have in them a plague of leprosy in the head or the beard;  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  030" id="13  030" >30</span>
 then the priest shall look on the plague, and, behold,   if   the appearance of it be beneath the skin, and in it there be thin yellowish hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a scurf, it is a leprosy of the head or a leprosy of the beard.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  031" id="13  031" >31</span>
 And if the priest should see the plague of the scurf, and, behold, the appearance of it be not beneath the skin, and there is no yellowish hair in it, then the priest shall set apart   him that has   the plague of the scurf seven days.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  032" id="13  032" >32</span>
 And the priest shall look at the plague on the seventh day; and, behold,   if   the scurf be not spread, and there be no yellowish hair on it, and the appearance of the scurf is not hollow under the skin;  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  033" id="13  033" >33</span>
 then the skin shall be shaven, but the scurf shall not be shaven; and the priest shall set aside the person having the scurf the second time for seven days.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  034" id="13  034" >34</span>
 And the priest shall see the scurf on the seventh day; and, behold,   if   the scurf is not spread in the skin after the man's being shaved, and the appearance of the scurf is not hollow beneath the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his garments, and be clean.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  035" id="13  035" >35</span>
 But if the scurf be indeed spread in the skin after he has been purified,  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  036" id="13  036" >36</span>
 then the priest shall look, and, behold,   if   the scurf be spread in the skin, the priest shall not examine concerning the yellow hair, for he is unclean.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  037" id="13  037" >37</span>
 But if the scurf remain before   him   in its place, and a dark hair should have arisen in it, the scurf is healed: he is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  038" id="13  038" >38</span>
 And if a man or woman should have in the skin of their flesh spots of a bright whiteness,  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  039" id="13  039" >39</span>
 then the priest shall look; and, behold, there   being   bright spots of a bright whiteness in the skin of their flesh, it is a tetter; it burst forth in the skin of his flesh; he is clean.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  040" id="13  040" >40</span>
 And if any one's head should lose the hair, he is   only   bald, he is clean.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  041" id="13  041" >41</span>
 And if his head should lose the hair in front, he is forehead bald: he is clean.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  042" id="13  042" >42</span>
 And if there should be in his baldness of head, or his baldness of forehead, a white or fiery plague, it is leprosy in his baldness of head, or baldness of forehead.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  043" id="13  043" >43</span>
 And the priest shall look upon him, and, behold, if the appearance of the plague be white or inflamed in his baldness of head or baldness in front, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of his flesh,  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  044" id="13  044" >44</span>
 he is a leprous man: the priest shall surely pronounce him unclean, his plague is in his head.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  045" id="13  045" >45</span>
 And the leper in whom the plague is, let his garments be ungirt, and his head uncovered; and let him have a covering put upon his mouth, and he shall be called unclean.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  046" id="13  046" >46</span>
 All the days in which the plague shall be upon him, being unclean, he shall be   esteemed   unclean; he shall dwell apart, his place of sojourn shall be without the camp.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  047" id="13  047" >47</span>
 And if a garment have in it the plague of leprosy, a garment of wool, or a garment of flax,  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  048" id="13  048" >48</span>
 either in the warp or in the woof, or in the linen, or in the woollen threads, or in a skin, or in any workmanship of skin,  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  049" id="13  049" >49</span>
 and the plague be greenish or reddish in the skin, or in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any utensil of skin, it is a plague of leprosy, and he shall show it to the priest.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  050" id="13  050" >50</span>
 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and the priest shall set apart   that which has   the plague seven days.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  051" id="13  051" >51</span>
 And the priest shall look upon the plague on the seventh day; and if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in the skin, in whatever things skins may be used in their workmanship, the plague is a confirmed leprosy; it is unclean.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  052" id="13  052" >52</span>
 He shall burn the garment, either the warp or woof in woollen garments or in flaxen, or in any utensil of skin, in which there may be the plague; because it is a confirmed leprosy; it shall be burnt with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  053" id="13  053" >53</span>
 And if the priest should see, and the plague be not spread in the garments, either in the warp or in the woof, or in any utensil of skin,  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  054" id="13  054" >54</span>
 then the priest shall give directions, and   one   shall wash that on which there may have been the plague, and the priest shall set it aside a second time for seven days.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  055" id="13  055" >55</span>
 And the priest shall look upon it after the plague has been washed; and   if   this, even the plague, has not changed its appearance, and the plague does not spread, it is unclean; it shall be burnt with fire: it is fixed in the garment, in the warp, or in the woof.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  056" id="13  056" >56</span>
 And if the priest should look, and the spot be dark after it has been washed, he shall tear it off from the garment, either from the warp or from the woof, or from the skin.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  057" id="13  057" >57</span>
 And if it should still appear in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of skin, it is a leprosy bursting forth: that wherein is the plague shall be burnt with fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  058" id="13  058" >58</span>
 And the garment, or the warp, or the woof, or any article of skin, which shall be washed, and the plague depart from it, shall also be washed again, and shall be clean.  <span class="verse" rel="v00313  059" id="13  059" >59</span>
 This is the law of the plague of leprosy of a woollen or linen garment, either of the warp, or woof, or any leather article, to pronounce it clean or unclean.

 the one for a sin-offering, the other for a whole burnt offering with the meat-offering, and the priest shall make an atonement before the Lord for him that is under purification.  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  032" id="14  032" >32</span>
 This is the law for him in whom is the plague of leprosy, and who can’t afford the offerings for his purification.  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  033" id="14  033" >33</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  034" id="14  034" >34</span>
 Whenever you° shall enter into the land of the Chananites, which I give you for a possession, and I shall put the plague of leprosy in the houses of the land of your possession;  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  035" id="14  035" >35</span>
 then the owner of the house shall come and report to the priest, saying, I have seen as it were a plague in the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  036" id="14  036" >36</span>
 And the priest shall give orders to remove the furniture of the house, before the priest comes in to see the plague, and   thus   none of the things in the house shall become unclean; and afterwards the priest shall go in to examine the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  037" id="14  037" >37</span>
 And he shall look on the plague, and, behold,   if   the plague is in the walls of the house,   he will see   greenish or reddish cavities, and the appearance of them   will be   beneath the surface of the walls.  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  038" id="14  038" >38</span>
 And the priest shall come out of the house to the door of the house, and the priest shall separate the house seven days.  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  039" id="14  039" >39</span>
 And the priest shall return on the seventh day and view the house; and, behold,   if   the plague is spread in the walls of the house,  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  040" id="14  040" >40</span>
 then the priest shall give orders, and they shall take away the stones in which the plague is, and shall cast them out of the city into an unclean place.  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  041" id="14  041" >41</span>
 And they shall scrape the house within round about, and shall pour out the dust scraped off outside the city into an unclean place.  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  042" id="14  042" >42</span>
 And they shall take other scraped stones, and put them in the place of the   former   stones, and they shall take other plaster and plaster the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  043" id="14  043" >43</span>
 And if the plague should return again, and break out in the house after they have taken away the stones and after the house is scraped, and after it has been plastered,  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  044" id="14  044" >44</span>
 then the priest shall go in and see if the plague is spread in the house: it is a confirmed leprosy in the house, it is unclean.  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  045" id="14  045" >45</span>
 And they shall take down the house, and its timbers and its stones, and they shall carry out all the mortar without the city into an unclean place.  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  046" id="14  046" >46</span>
 And he that goes into the house at any time, during its separation, shall be unclean until evening.  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  047" id="14  047" >47</span>
 And he that sleeps in the house shall wash his garments, and be unclean until evening; and he that eats in the house shall wash his garments, and be unclean until evening.  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  048" id="14  048" >48</span>
 and if the priest shall arrive and enter and see, and behold the plague be not at all spread in the house after the house has been plastered, then the priest shall declare the house clean, because the plague is healed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  049" id="14  049" >49</span>
 And he shall take to purify the house two clean living birds, and cedar wood, and spun scarlet, and hyssop.  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  050" id="14  050" >50</span>
 And he shall kill one bird in an earthen vessel over running water.  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  051" id="14  051" >51</span>
 And he shall take the cedar wood, and the spun scarlet, and the hyssop, and the living bird; and shall dip it into the blood of the bird slain over running water, and with them he shall sprinkle the house seven times.  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  052" id="14  052" >52</span>
 and he shall purify the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the spun scarlet.  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  053" id="14  053" >53</span>
 And he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the field, and shall make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean.  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  054" id="14  054" >54</span>
 This   is   the law concerning every plague of leprosy and scurf,  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  055" id="14  055" >55</span>
 and of the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  056" id="14  056" >56</span>
 and of a sore, and of a clear spot, and of a shining one,  <span class="verse" rel="v00314  057" id="14  057" >57</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="22  001">22  </span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  002" id="22  002" >2</span>
 Speak to Aaron and to his sons, and let them take heed concerning the holy things of the children of Israel, so they shall not profane my holy name in any of the things which they consecrate to me: I   am   the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  003" id="22  003" >3</span>
 Say to them, Every man throughout your generations, whoever of all your seed shall approach to the holy things, whatever the children of Israel shall consecrate to the Lord, while his uncleanness is upon him, that soul shall be cut off from me: I   am   the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  004" id="22  004" >4</span>
 And the man of the seed of Aaron the priest, if he should have leprosy or issue of the reins, shall not eat of the holy things, until he be cleansed; and he that touches any uncleanness of a dead body, or the man whose seed of copulation shall have gone out from him,  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  005" id="22  005" >5</span>
 or whoever shall touch any unclean reptile, which will defile him, or   who shall touch   a man, whereby he shall defile him according to all his uncleanness:  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  006" id="22  006" >6</span>
 whatever soul shall touch them shall be unclean until evening; he shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his body in water,  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  007" id="22  007" >7</span>
 and the sun go down, and then he shall be clean; and then shall he eat of all the holy things, for they are his bread.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  008" id="22  008" >8</span>
 He shall not eat that which dies of itself, or is taken of beasts, so that he should be polluted by them: I   am   the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  009" id="22  009" >9</span>
 And they shall keep my ordinances, that they do not bear iniquity because of them, and die because of them, if they shall profane them: I   am   the Lord God that sanctifies them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  010" id="22  010" >10</span>
 And no stranger shall eat the holy things: one that sojourns with a priest, or a hireling, shall not eat the holy things.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  011" id="22  011" >11</span>
 But if a priest should have a soul purchased for money, he shall eat of his bread; and they that are born in his house, they also shall eat of his bread.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  012" id="22  012" >12</span>
 And if the daughter of a priest should marry a stranger, she shall not eat of the offerings of the sanctuary.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  013" id="22  013" >13</span>
 And if the daughter of priest should be a widow, or put away, and have no seed, she shall return to her father's house, as in her youth: she shall eat of her father's bread, but no stranger shall eat of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  014" id="22  014" >14</span>
 And the man who shall ignorantly eat holy things, shall add the fifth part to it, and give the holy thing to the priest.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  015" id="22  015" >15</span>
 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  016" id="22  016" >16</span>

 They shall not bring to the Lord anything that has a blemish in it, for it shall not be acceptable for you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  021" id="22  021" >21</span>
 And whatever man shall offer a peace-offering to the Lord, discharging a vow, or in the way of free will offering, or an offering in your feasts, of the herds or of the sheep, it shall be without blemish for acceptance: there shall be no blemish in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  022" id="22  022" >22</span>
 One that is blind, or broken, or has its tongue cut out, or is troubled with warts, or has a malignant ulcer, or tetters, they shall not offer these to the Lord; neither shall you° offer any of them for a burnt offering on the altar of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  023" id="22  023" >23</span>
 And a calf or a sheep with the ears cut off, or that has lost its tail, you shall kill them for yourself; but they shall not be accepted for your vow.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  024" id="22  024" >24</span>
 That which has broken testicles, or is crushed or gelt or mutilated, —you shall not offer them to the Lord, neither shall you° sacrifice them upon your land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  025" id="22  025" >25</span>
 Neither shall you° offer the gifts of your God of all these things by the hand of a stranger, because there is corruption in them, a blemish in them: these shall not be accepted for you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  026" id="22  026" >26</span>
 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  027" id="22  027" >27</span>
 As for a calf, or a sheep, or a goat, whenever it is born, then shall it be seven days under its mother; and on the eighth day and after they shall be accepted for sacrifices, a burnt offering to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  028" id="22  028" >28</span>
 And a bullock and a ewe, it and its young, you shall not kill in one day.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  029" id="22  029" >29</span>
 And if you should offer a sacrifice, a vow of rejoicing to the Lord, you° shall offer it so as to be accepted for you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  030" id="22  030" >30</span>
 In that same day it shall be eaten; you° shall not leave of the flesh till the morrow: I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  031" id="22  031" >31</span>
 And you° shall keep my commandments and do them.  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  032" id="22  032" >32</span>
 And you° shall not profane the name of the Holy One, and I will be sanctified in the midst of the children of Israel. I   am   the Lord that sanctifies you,  <span class="verse" rel="v00322  033" id="22  033" >33</span>

 Speak to the children of Israel, and you shall say to them, When you° shall enter into the land which I give you, and reap the harvest of it, then shall you° bring a sheaf, the first fruits of your harvest, to the priest;  <span class="verse" rel="v00323  011" id="23  011" >11</span>

 Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vine, and gather in its fruit.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  004" id="25  004" >4</span>
 But in the seventh year   shall be   a sabbath, it shall be a rest to the land, a sabbath to the Lord: you shall not sow your field, and you shall not prune your vine.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  005" id="25  005" >5</span>
 And you shall not gather the spontaneous produce of your field, and you shall not gather fully the grapes of your dedication: it shall be a year of rest to the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  006" id="25  006" >6</span>
 And the sabbaths of the land shall be food for you, and for your man-servant, and for your maidservant, and your hireling, and the stranger that abides with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  007" id="25  007" >7</span>
 And for your cattle, and for the wild beats that are in your land, shall every fruit of it be for food.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  008" id="25  008" >8</span>
 And you shall reckon to yourself seven sabbaths of years, seven times seven years; and they shall be to you seven weeks of years, nine and forty years.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  009" id="25  009" >9</span>
 In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you° shall make a proclamation with the sound of a trumpet in all your land; on the day of atonement you° shall make a proclamation with a trumpet in all your land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  010" id="25  010" >10</span>
 And you° shall sanctify the year, the fifties year, and you° shall proclaim a release upon the land to all that inhabit it; it shall be given a year of release, a jubilee for you; and each one shall depart to his possession, and you° shall go each to his family.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  011" id="25  011" >11</span>
 This is a jubilee of release, the year shall be to you the fifties year: you° shall not sow, nor reap the produce that comes of itself from the land, neither shall you° gather its dedicated fruits.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  012" id="25  012" >12</span>
 For it is a jubilee of release; it shall be holy to you, you° shall eat its fruits off the fields.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  013" id="25  013" >13</span>
 In the year of the release   even   the jubilee of it, shall   each   one return to his possession.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  014" id="25  014" >14</span>
 And if you should sell a possession to your neighbor, or if you should buy of your neighbor, let not a man oppress his neighbor.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  015" id="25  015" >15</span>
 According to the number of years after the jubilee shall you buy of your neighbor, according to the number of years of the fruits shall he sell to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  016" id="25  016" >16</span>
 According as   there may be   a greater number of years he shall increase   the value of   his possession, and according as   there may be   a less number of years he shall lessen   the value of   his possession; for according to the number of his crops, so shall he sell to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  017" id="25  017" >17</span>
 Let not a man oppress his neighbor, and you shall fear the Lord your God: I am the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  018" id="25  018" >18</span>
 And you° shall keep all my ordinances, and all my judgments; and do you° observe them, and you° shall keep them, and dwell securely in the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  019" id="25  019" >19</span>
 And the land shall yield her increase, and you° shall eat to fullness, and shall dwell securely in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  020" id="25  020" >20</span>
 And if you° should say, What shall we eat in this seventh year, if we do not sow nor gather in our fruits?  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  021" id="25  021" >21</span>
 Then will I send my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and the land shall produce its fruits for three years.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  022" id="25  022" >22</span>
 And you° shall sow in the eighth year, and eat old fruits till the ninth year: until its fruit come, you° shall eat old fruits of the old.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  023" id="25  023" >23</span>
 And the land shall not be sold for a permanence; for the land is mine, because you° are strangers and sojourners before me.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  024" id="25  024" >24</span>
 And in every land of your possession, you° shall allow ransoms for the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  025" id="25  025" >25</span>
 And if your brother who is with you be poor, and should have sold   part   of his possession, and his kinsman who is near to him come, then he shall redeem the possession which his brother has sold.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  026" id="25  026" >26</span>
 And if one have no near kinsman, and he prosper with his hand, and he find sufficient money,   even   his ransom;  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  027" id="25  027" >27</span>
 then shall he calculate the years of his sale, and he shall give what is due to the man to whom he sold it, and he shall return to his possession.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  028" id="25  028" >28</span>
 But if his hand have not prospered sufficiently, so as that he should restore the money to him, then he that bought the possessions shall have them till the sixth year of the release; and it shall go out in the release, and the owner shall return to his possession.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  029" id="25  029" >29</span>
 And if any one should sell an inhabited house in a walled city, then there shall be the ransom of it, until   the time   is fulfilled: its time of ransom shall be a full year.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  030" id="25  030" >30</span>
 And if it be not ransomed until there be completed of its time a full year, the house which is in the walled city shall be surely confirmed to him that bought it, throughout his generations; and it shall not go out in the release.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  031" id="25  031" >31</span>
 But the houses in the villages which have not a wall round about them, shall be reckoned as the fields of the country: they shall always be redeemable, and they shall go out in the release.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  032" id="25  032" >32</span>
 And the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities in their possession, shall be always redeemable to the Levites.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  033" id="25  033" >33</span>
 And if any one shall redeem a house of the Levites, then shall their sale of the houses of their possession go out in the release; because the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession in the midst of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  034" id="25  034" >34</span>
 And the lands set apart for their cities shall not be sold, because this is their perpetual possession.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  035" id="25  035" >35</span>
 And if your brother who is with you become poor, and he fail in resources with you, you shall help him as a stranger and a sojourner, and your brother shall live with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  036" id="25  036" >36</span>
 You shall not receive from him interest, nor increase: and you shall fear your God: I   am   the Lord: and your brother shall live with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  037" id="25  037" >37</span>
 You shall not lend your money to him at interest, and you shall not lend your meat to him to be returned with increase.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  038" id="25  038" >38</span>
 I   am   the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Chanaan, so as to be your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  039" id="25  039" >39</span>
 And if your brother by you be lowered, and be sold to you, he shall not serve you with the servitude of a slave.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  040" id="25  040" >40</span>
 He shall be with you as a hireling or a sojourner, he shall work for you till the year of release:  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  041" id="25  041" >41</span>
 and he shall go out in the release, and his children with him; and he shall go to his family, he shall hasten back to his patrimony.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  042" id="25  042" >42</span>
 Because these are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; such an one shall not be sold as a   common   servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  043" id="25  043" >43</span>
 You shall not oppress him with labor, and shall fear the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  044" id="25  044" >44</span>
 And whatever number of menservants and maidservants you shall have, you shall purchase male and female servants from the nations that are round about you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  045" id="25  045" >45</span>
 And of the sons of the sojourners that are among you, of these you° shall buy and of their relations, all that shall be in your lands; let them be to you for a possession.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  046" id="25  046" >46</span>
 And you° shall distribute them to your children after you, and they shall be to you permanent possessions for ever: but of your brethren the children of Israel, one shall not oppress his brother in labors.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  047" id="25  047" >47</span>
 And if a stranger or sojourner with you wax rich, and your brother in distress be sold to the stranger or the sojourner that is with you, or to a proselyte by extraction;  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  048" id="25  048" >48</span>
 after he is sold to him there shall be redemption for him, one of his brethren shall redeem him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  049" id="25  049" >49</span>
 A brother of his father, or a son of his father's brother shall redeem him; or let one of his near kin of his tribe redeem him, and if he should be rich and redeem himself,  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  050" id="25  050" >50</span>
 then shall he calculate with his purchaser from the year that he sold himself to him until the year of release: and the money of his purchase shall be as that of a hireling, he shall be with him from year to year.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  051" id="25  051" >51</span>
 And if any have a greater number of years   than enough  , according to these he shall pay his ransom out of his purchase-money.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  052" id="25  052" >52</span>
 And if but a little time be left of the years to the year of release, then shall he reckon to him according to his years, and shall pay his ransom  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  053" id="25  053" >53</span>
 as a hireling; he shall be with him from year to year; you shall not oppress him with labor before you.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  054" id="25  054" >54</span>
 And if he do not pay his ransom accordingly, he shall go out in the year of his release, he and his children with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v00325  055" id="25  055" >55</span>
 For the children of Israel are my servants: they are my attendants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt.

 If you° will walk in my ordinances, and keep my commandments, and do them,  <span class="verse" rel="v00326  004" id="26  004" >4</span>

 and I walked with them with a perverse mind; and I will destroy them in the land of their enemies: then shall their uncircumcised heart be ashamed, and then shall they acquiesce in   the punishment of   their sins.  <span class="verse" rel="v00326  042" id="26  042" >42</span>
 And I will remember the covenant of Jacob, and the covenant of Isaac, and the covenant of Abraam will I remember.  <span class="verse" rel="v00326  043" id="26  043" >43</span>
 And I will remember the land, and the land shall be left of them; then the land shall enjoy her sabbaths, when it is deserted through them: and they shall accept   the punishment of   their iniquities, because they neglected my judgments, and in their soul loathed my ordinances.  <span class="verse" rel="v00326  044" id="26  044" >44</span>
 And yet not even thus, while they were in the land of their enemies, did I overlook them, nor did I loathe them so as to consume them, to break my covenant made with them; for I am the Lord their God.  <span class="verse" rel="v00326  045" id="26  045" >45</span>
 And I will remember their former covenant, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage before the nation, to be their God; I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00326  046" id="26  046" >46</span>

 And if   the worshipper   will at all redeem it, he shall add the fifth part to its value.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  014" id="27  014" >14</span>
 And whatever man shall consecrate his house as holy to the Lord, the priest shall make a valuation of it between the good and the bad: as the priest shall value it, so shall it stand.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  015" id="27  015" >15</span>
 And if he that has sanctified it should redeem his house, he shall add to it the fifth part of the money of the valuation, and it shall be his.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  016" id="27  016" >16</span>
 And if a man should hallow to the Lord a part of the field of his possession, then the valuation shall be according to its seed, fifty didrachmas of silver for a homer of barley.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  017" id="27  017" >17</span>
 And if he should sanctify his field from the year of release, it shall stand according to his valuation.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  018" id="27  018" >18</span>
 And if he should sanctify his field in the latter time after the release, the priest shall reckon to him the money for the remaining years, until the   next   year of release, and it shall be deducted as an equivalent from his full valuation.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  019" id="27  019" >19</span>
 And if he that sanctified the field would redeem it, he shall add to its value the fifth part of the money, and it shall be his.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  020" id="27  020" >20</span>
 And if he do not redeem the field, but should sell the field to another man, he shall not after redeem it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  021" id="27  021" >21</span>
 But the field shall be holy to the Lord after the release, as separated land; the priest shall have possession of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  022" id="27  022" >22</span>
 And if he should consecrate to the Lord of a field which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession,  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  023" id="27  023" >23</span>
 the priest shall reckon to him the full valuation from the year of release, and he shall pay the valuation in that day   as   holy to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  024" id="27  024" >24</span>
 And in the year of release the land shall be restored to the man of whom the other bought it, whose the possession of the land was.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  025" id="27  025" >25</span>
 And every valuation shall be by holy weights: the didrachm shall be twenty oboli.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  026" id="27  026" >26</span>
 And every firstborn which shall be produced among your cattle shall be the Lord's, and no man shall sanctify it: whether calf or sheep, it is the Lord's.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  027" id="27  027" >27</span>
 But if he should redeem an unclean beast, according to its valuation, then he shall add the fifth part to it, and it shall be his; and if he redeem it not, it shall be sold according to its valuation.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  028" id="27  028" >28</span>
 And every dedicated thing which a man shall dedicate to the Lord of all that he has, whether man or beast, or of the field of his possession, he shall not sell it, nor redeem it: every devoted thing shall be most holy to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  029" id="27  029" >29</span>
 And whatever shall be dedicated of men, shall not be ransomed, but shall be surely put to death.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  030" id="27  030" >30</span>
 Every tithe of the land, both of the seed of the land, and of the fruit of trees, is the Lord's, holy to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  031" id="27  031" >31</span>
 And if a man should at all redeem his tithe, he shall add the fifth part to it, and it shall be his.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  032" id="27  032" >32</span>
 And every tithe of oxen, and of sheep, and whatever may come in numbering under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  033" id="27  033" >33</span>
 You shall not change a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if you should at all change it, its equivalent also shall be holy, it shall not be redeemed.  <span class="verse" rel="v00327  034" id="27  034" >34</span>
 These are the commandments which the Lord commanded Moses for the sons of Israel in mount Sina.
