<h2>(2 Samuel) </h2>
<!-- 1   001 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">A</span>nd it came to pass after Saul was dead, that David returned from striking Amalec, and David abode two days in Sekelac.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 And it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came from the camp, from the people of Saul, and his garments were tore, and earth   was   upon his head: and it came to pass when he went in to David, that he fell upon the earth, and did obeisance to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 And David said to him, Whence come you? and he said to him, I have escaped out of the camp of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And David said to him, What   is   the matter? tell me. And he said, The people fled out of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   war.  </span>  battle, and many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 And David said to the young man who brought him the tidings, How know you that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 And the young man that brought the tidings, said to him, I happened accidentally to be upon mount Gelbue; and, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear, and, behold, the chariots and captains of horse pressed hard upon him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 And he looked behind him, and saw me, and called me; and I said, Behold,   here am   I.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 And he said to me, Who are you? and I said, I am an Amalekite.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 And he said to me, Stand, I pray you, over me, and kill me, for a dreadful darkness has come upon me, for all my life   is   in me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   will.  </span>  would not live after he was fallen; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was upon his arm, and I have brought them hither to my lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 And David laid hold of his garments, and tore them; and all the men who were with him tore their garments.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 And they lamented, and wept, and fasted till evening, for Saul and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Juda, and for the house of Israel, because they were struck with the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 And David said to the young man who brought the tidings to him, Whence are you? and he said, I am the son of an Amalekite sojourner.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 And David said to him, How was it you were not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the anointed of the Lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 And David called one of his young men, and said, Go and fall upon him: and he struck him, and he died.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 And David said to him, Your blood   be   upon your own head; for your mouth has  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   answered.  </span>  testified against you, saying, I have slain the anointed of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 And he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   told.  </span>  gave orders to teach it the sons of Juda: behold, it is written in the book of  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   straight,   or   right, sometimes upright, as of a man.   Heb. Jasher.  </span>  Right.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The LXX. take הצבי as from כיצב, the   A.V.   from צבי.  </span>  Set up a pillar, O Israel, for  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Two words here are used, as is often the case in the LXX. to express one.   viz.   τεθηκότων and τραυματτιῶν to express חלל  </span>  the slain that died upon your high places: how are the mighty fallen!  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 Tell it not in Geth, and tell it not as glad tidings in the streets of Ascalon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  021" id="1  021" >21</span>
 You° mountains of Gelbue, let not dew no rain descend upon you, nor fields of first fruits   be upon you  , for there the shield of the mighty ones has been grievously assailed; the shield of Saul was not anointed with oil.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  022" id="1  022" >22</span>
 From the blood of the slain, and from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan returned not empty; and the sword of Saul turned not back empty.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  023" id="1  023" >23</span>
 Saul and Jonathan, the beloved and the beautiful, were not divided: comely   were they   in their life, and in their death they were not divided:   they were   swifter than eagles, and they were stronger than lions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  024" id="1  024" >24</span>
 Daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you with scarlet together with your adorning, who added golden ornaments to your apparel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  025" id="1  025" >25</span>
 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, even the slain ones upon your high places!  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  026" id="1  026" >26</span>
 I am grieved for you, my brother Jonathan; you were very lovely to me; your love to me was wonderful beyond the love of women.  <span class="verse" rel="v0101  027" id="1  027" >27</span>
 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> And it came to pass after this that David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up into one of the cities of Juda? and the Lord said to him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? and he said, To Chebron.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 And David went up there to Chebron,   he   and both his wives, Achinaam the Jezraelitess, and Abigaia the wife of Nabal the Carmelite,  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 and the men that were with him, every one and his family; and they lived in the cities of Chebron.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 And the men of Judea come, and anoint David there to reign over the house of Juda; and they reported to David, saying, The men of Jabis of the country of Galaad have buried Saul.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 And David sent messengers to the rulers of Jabis of the country of Galaad, and David said to them, Blessed be you° of the Lord, because you° have wrought this mercy toward your lord, even toward Saul the anointed of the Lord, and you° have buried him and Jonathan his son.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 And now may the Lord deal in mercy and truth towards you: and I also will requite towards you this good deed, because you° have done this.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 And now let your hands be made strong, and be  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   mighty sons.  </span>  valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and moreover the house of Juda have anointed me to be king over them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 But Abenner, the son of Ner, the commander-in-chief of Saul's army, took Jebosthe son of Saul, and brought him up from the camp to Manaem  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Observe the active use of ἐβασίλευσεν, common in LXX.  </span>  made him king over the land of Galaad, and over Thasiri, and over Jezrael, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 Jebosthe, Saul's son   was   forty years old, when he reigned over Israel; and he reigned two years, but not over the house of Juda, who followed David.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 And the days which David reigned in Chebron over the house of Juda were seven years and six months.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 And Abenner the son of Ner went forth, and the servants of Jebosthe the son of Saul, from Manaem to Gabaon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 And Joab the son of Saruia, and the servants of David, went forth from Chebron, and met them at the fountain of Gabaon, at the same place: and these sat down by the fountain on this side, and those by the fountain on that side.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 And Abenner said to Joab, Let now the young men arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 And there arose and passed over by number twelve of the children of Benjamin, belonging to Jebosthe the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 And they seized every one the head of his neighbor with his hand, and his sword   was thrust   into the side of his neighbor, and they fall down together: and the name of that place was called The portion of the treacherous ones, which is in Gabaon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 And the battle was very severe on that day; and Abenner and the men of Israel were worsted before the servants of David.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 And there were there the three sons of Saruia, Joab, and Abessa, and Asael: and Asael was swift in his feet as a roe in the field.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 And Asael followed after Abenner, and turned not to go to the right hand or to the left from following Abenner.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 And Abenner looked behind him, and said, Are you Asael himself? and he said, I am.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 And Abenner said to him, Turn you to the right hand or to the left, and lay hold for yourself on one of the young men, and take to yourself his armor: but Asel would not turn back from following him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 And Abenner said yet again to Asael, Stand aloof from me, lest I strike you to the ground? and how should I lift up my face to Joab?  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  023" id="2  023" >23</span>
 And what does this mean? return to Joab your brother? But he would not stand aloof; and Abenner smites him with the hinder end of the spear on the loins, and the spear went out behind him, and he falls there and dies  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        A literal version of the Hebrew חחחו   q.d.   sur le champ.  </span>  on the spot: and it came to pass that every one that came to the place where Asael fell and died, stood still.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  024" id="2  024" >24</span>
 And Joab and Abessa pursued after Abenner, and the sun went down: and they went as far as the hill of Amman, which is in the front of Gai, by the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See Acts 8. 26.  </span>  desert way of Gabaon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  025" id="2  025" >25</span>
 And the children of Benjamin who followed Abenner gather themselves together, and they formed themselves into one body, and stood on the top of a hill.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  026" id="2  026" >26</span>
 And Abenner called Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour perpetually? know you not that it will be bitter at last? How long then will you refuse to tell the people to turn from following our brethren?  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  027" id="2  027" >27</span>
 And Joab said, As the Lord lives, if you had not spoken, even from the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  028" id="2  028" >28</span>
 And Joab sounded the trumpet, and all the people departed, and did not pursue after Israel, and did not fight any longer.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  029" id="2  029" >29</span>
 And Abenner and his men departed at evening,   and went   all that night, and crossed over Jordan, and went along the whole adjacent   country  , and they come to the camp.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  030" id="2  030" >30</span>
 And Joab returned from following Abenner, and he assembled all the people, and there were missing of the people of David, nineteen men, and Asael.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  031" id="2  031" >31</span>
 And the servants of David struck of the children of Benjamin, of the men of Abenner, three hundred and sixty men belonging to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0102  032" id="2  032" >32</span>
 And they take up Asael, and bury him in the tomb of his father in Bethleem. And Joab and the men with him went all the night, and the morning rose upon them in Chebron.

<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> And there was war for a long time between the house of Saul and the house of David; and the house of David grew continually stronger; but the house of Saul grew continually weaker.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 And sons were born to David in Chebron: and his firstborn was Ammon the son of Achinoom the Jezraelitess.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 And his second son   was   Daluia, the son of Abigaia the Carmelitess; and the third, Abessalom the son of Maacha the daughter of Tholmi the king of Gessir.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 And the fourth   was   Ornia, the son of Aggith, and the fifth   was   Saphatia, the son of Abital.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 And the sixth   was   Jetheraam, the son of Aegal the wife of David. These were born to David in Chebron.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 And it came to pass while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abenner was governing the house of Saul.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 And Saul had a concubine, Respha, the daughter of Jol; and Jebosthe the son of Saul said to Abenner, Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 And Abenner was very angry with Jebosthe for this saying; and Abenner said to him, Am I a dog's head? I have this day wrought kindness with the house of Saul your father, and with his brethren and friends, and have not gone over to the house of David, and do you this day seek a charge against me concerning injury to a woman?  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 God do thus and more also to Abenner, if as the Lord swore to David, so do I not to him this day;  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 to take away the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to raise up the throne of David over Israel and over Juda from Dan to Bersabee.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 And Jebosthe could not any longer answer Abenner a word, because he feared him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 And Abenner sent messengers to David to Thaelam where he was, immediately, saying, Make your covenant with me, and, behold, my hand   is   with you to bring back to you all the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 And David said, With a good will I will make with you a covenant: only I demand one condition of you, saying, You shall not see my face, unless you bring Melchol the daughter of Saul, when you come to see my face.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 And David sent messengers to Jebosthe the son of Saul, saying, Restore me my wife Melchol, whom I took for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 And Jebosthe sent, and took her from her husband,   even   from Phaltiel the son of Selle.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 And her husband went with her weeping behind her as far as Barakim. And Abenner said to him, Go, return; and he returned.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 And Abenner spoke to the elders of Israel, saying, In former days you° sought David to reign over you;  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 and now perform   it  : for the Lord has spoken concerning David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save Israel out of the hand of all their enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  019" id="3  019" >19</span>
 And Abenner spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abenner went to speak in the ears of David at Chebron, all that seemed good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of the house of Benjamin.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  020" id="3  020" >20</span>
 And Abenner came to David to Chebron, and with him twenty men: and David made for Abenner and his men with him a banquet of wine.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  021" id="3  021" >21</span>
 And Abenner said to David, I will arise now, and go, and gather to my lord the king all Israel; and I will make with him a covenant, and you shall reign over all whom your soul desires. And David sent away Abenner, and he departed in peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  022" id="3  022" >22</span>
 And, behold, the servants of David and Joab arrived from their expedition, and they brought much spoil with them: and Abenner was not with David in Chebron, because he had sent him away, and he had departed in peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  023" id="3  023" >23</span>
 And Joab and all his army came, and it was reported to Joab, saying, Abenner the son of Ner is come to David, and David has let him go, and he has departed in peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  024" id="3  024" >24</span>
 And Joab went in to the king, and said, What   is   this   that   you have done? behold, Abenner came to you; and why have you let him go, and he has departed in peace?  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  025" id="3  025" >25</span>
 Know you not the mischief of Abenner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all things that you do?  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  026" id="3  026" >26</span>
 And Joab returned from David, and sent messengers to Abenner after   him  ; and they bring him back from the well of Seiram: but David knew   it   not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  027" id="3  027" >27</span>
 And he brought back Abenner to Chebron, and Joab caused him to turn aside from the gate to speak to him, laying wait for him: and he struck him there in the loins, and he died for the blood of Asael the brother of Joab.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  028" id="3  028" >28</span>
 And David heard   of it   afterwards, and said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the Lord even for ever of the blood of Abenner the son of Ner.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  029" id="3  029" >29</span>

 For Joab and Abessa his brother laid wait continually for Abenner, because he killed Asael their brother at Gabaon in the battle.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  031" id="3  031" >31</span>
 And David said to Joab and to all the people with him, Rend your garments, and gird yourselves with sackcloth, and lament before Abenner. And king David followed the bier.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  032" id="3  032" >32</span>
 And they bury Abenner in Chebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at his tomb, and all the people wept for Abenner.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  033" id="3  033" >33</span>
 And the king mourned over Abenner, and said, Shall Abenner die according to the death of Nabal?  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  034" id="3  034" >34</span>
 Your hands were not bound, and your feet   were   not   put   in fetters:   one   brought   you   not near as Nabal; you did fall before children of iniquity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  035" id="3  035" >35</span>
 And all the people assembled to weep for him. And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day: and David swore, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I eat bread or any thing else before the sun goes down.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  036" id="3  036" >36</span>
 And all the people took notice, and all things that the king did before the people were pleasing in their sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  037" id="3  037" >37</span>
 So all the people and all Israel perceived in that day, that it was not of the king to kill Abenner the son of Ner.  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  038" id="3  038" >38</span>
 And the king said to his servants, Know you° not that a great prince is this day fallen in Israel?  <span class="verse" rel="v0103  039" id="3  039" >39</span>
 And that I am this day a   mere   kinsman   of his  , and   as it were    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   appointed by a king.  </span>  a subject; but these men the sons of Saruia are too hard for me: the Lord reward the evil-doer according to his wickedness.

<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> And Jebosthe the son of Saul heard that Abenner the son of Ner had died in Chebron; and his hands were paralyzed, and all the men of Israel grew faint.  <span class="verse" rel="v0104  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 And Jebosthe the son of Saul had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one   was   Baana, and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Remmon the Berothite of the children of Benjamin; for Beroth was reckoned to the children of Benjamin.  <span class="verse" rel="v0104  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 And the Berothites ran away to Gethaim, and were sojourners there until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0104  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 And Jonathan Saul's son   had   a son lame of his feet, five years old, and he was   in the way   when the news of Saul and Jonathan his son came from Jezrael, and his nurse took him up, and fled; and it came to pass as he hasted and retreated, that he fell, and was lamed. And his name   was   Memphibosthe.  <span class="verse" rel="v0104  005" id="4  005" >5</span>
 And Rechab and Baana the sons of Remmon the Berothite went, and they came in the heat of the day into the house of Jebosthe; and he was sleeping on a bed at noon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0104  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 And, behold, the porter of the house winnowed wheat, and he slumbered and slept: and the brothers Rechab and Baana went privily into the house:  <span class="verse" rel="v0104  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 And Jebosthe was sleeping on his bed in his chamber: and they strike him, and kill him, and take off his head: and they took his head, and went all the night by the western road.  <span class="verse" rel="v0104  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 And they brought the head of Jebosthe to David to Chebron, and they said to the king, Behold the head of Jebosthe the son of Saul your enemy, who sought your life; and the Lord has  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   given.  </span>  executed for my lord the king vengeance on his enemies, as   it is   this day: even on Saul your enemy, and on his seed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0104  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 And David answered and Rechab and Baana his brother, the sons of Remmon the Berothite, and said to them,   As   the Lord lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all affliction;  <span class="verse" rel="v0104  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 he that reported to me that Saul was dead, even he was as one bringing glad tidings before me: but I seized him and killed him in Sekelac, to whom I ought,   as he thought  , to have given a reward for his tidings.  <span class="verse" rel="v0104  011" id="4  011" >11</span>

 And David commanded his young men, and they kill them, and cut off their hands and their feet; and they hung them up at the fountain in Chebron: and they buried the head of Jebosthe in the tomb of Abenezer the son of Ner.

 Seven years and six months he reigned in Chebron over Juda, and thirty-three years he reigned over all Israel and Juda in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0105  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 And David and his men, departed to Jerusalem, to the Jebusite that inhabited the land: and it was said to David, You shall not come in hither: for the blind and the lame withstood him, saying, David shall not come in hither.  <span class="verse" rel="v0105  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 And David took first the hold of Sion: this   is   the city of David.  <span class="verse" rel="v0105  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 And David said on that day, Every one that smites the Jebusite, let him attack with the dagger both the lame and the blind, and those that hate the soul of David. Therefore they say, The lame and the blind shall not enter into the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0105  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 And David lived in the hold, and it was called the city of David, and he built the city itself round about from the citadel, and   he built   his own house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0105  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 And David advanced and became great, and the Lord Almighty   was   with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0105  011" id="5  011" >11</span>

 And the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over Israel; and all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the strong hold.  <span class="verse" rel="v0105  018" id="5  018" >18</span>
 And the Philistines came, and assembled in the valley of the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   Titans.   Heb.   Rephaim.

 And David came from  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb.

 And David arose, and went, he and all the people that were with him, and some of the rulers of Juda, on an expedition   to a distant place  , to bring back thence the ark of God, on which the name of the Lord of Host who dwells between the cherubs upon it is called.  <span class="verse" rel="v0106  003" id="6  003" >3</span>
 And they put the ark of the Lord on a new waggon, and took it out of the house of Aminadab who lived on the hill, and Oza and his brethren the sons of Aminadab drove the waggon  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.   more according to the   Heb. inserts 'and brought it out of the house of Abinadab in the hill.'  </span>  with the ark.  <span class="verse" rel="v0106  004" id="6  004" >4</span>
 And his brethren went before the ark.  <span class="verse" rel="v0106  005" id="6  005" >5</span>
 And David and the children of Israel   were   playing before the Lord on well-tuned instruments mightily, and with songs, and with harps, and with lutes, and with drums, and with cymbals, and with pipes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0106  006" id="6  006" >6</span>
 And they come as far as the threshing floor of Nachor: and Oza reached forth his hand to the ark of God to keep it steady, and took hold of it; for  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the calf.  </span>  the ox shook it out of its place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0106  007" id="6  007" >7</span>

 And David was dispirited because the Lord made a breach upon Oza; and that place was called the breach of Oza until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0106  009" id="6  009" >9</span>
 And David feared the Lord in that day, saying, How shall the ark of the Lord come in to me?  <span class="verse" rel="v0106  010" id="6  010" >10</span>
 And David would not bring in the ark of the covenant of the Lord to himself into the city of David: and David turned it aside into the house of Abeddara the Gethite.  <span class="verse" rel="v0106  011" id="6  011" >11</span>
 And the ark of the Lord lodged in the house of Abeddara the Gethite three months, and the Lord blessed all the house of Abeddara, and all his possessions.  <span class="verse" rel="v0106  012" id="6  012" >12</span>
 And it was reported to king David, saying, The Lord has blessed the house of Abeddara, and all that he has, because of the ark of the Lord.

 And there were with him bearing the ark seven bands, and for a sacrifice a calf and lambs.  <span class="verse" rel="v0106  014" id="6  014" >14</span>
 And David sounded with well-tuned instruments before the Lord, and David   was   clothed with a fine long robe.  <span class="verse" rel="v0106  015" id="6  015" >15</span>
 And David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting, and with the sound of a trumpet.  <span class="verse" rel="v0106  016" id="6  016" >16</span>
 And it came to pass as the ark arrived at the city of David, that Melchol the daughter of Saul looked through the window, and saw king David dancing and playing before the Lord; and she despised him in her heart.  <span class="verse" rel="v0106  017" id="6  017" >17</span>
 And they bring the ark of the Lord, and set it in its place in the midst of the tabernacle which David pitched for it: and David offered whole burnt offerings before the Lord,   and   peace-offerings.  <span class="verse" rel="v0106  018" id="6  018" >18</span>
 And David made an end of offering the whole burnt offerings and peace-offerings, and blessed the people in the name of the Lord of Hosts.  <span class="verse" rel="v0106  019" id="6  019" >19</span>
 And he distributed to all the people, even to all the host of Israel from Dan to Bersabee, both men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a joint of meat, and a cake from the frying-pan: and all the people departed every one to his home.  <span class="verse" rel="v0106  020" id="6  020" >20</span>
 And David returned to bless his house. And Melchol the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and saluted him, and said, How was the king of Israel glorified today, who was today uncovered in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the dancers wantonly uncovers himself!  <span class="verse" rel="v0106  021" id="6  021" >21</span>
 And David said to Melchol, I will dance before the Lord. Blessed   be   the Lord who chose me before your father, and before all his house, to make me head over his people, even over Israel: therefore I will play, and dance before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0106  022" id="6  022" >22</span>
 And I will again uncover myself thus, and I will be vile in your eyes, and with the maidservants by whom you said that I was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.   omits the negative, but still differs from the Hebrew.  </span>  not had in honor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0106  023" id="6  023" >23</span>

 Go, and say to my servant David, Thus says the Lord, You shall not build me a house for me to dwell in.  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  006" id="7  006" >6</span>
 For I have not lived in a house from the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt to this day, but I have been walking in a lodge and in a tent,  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  007" id="7  007" >7</span>
 wherever I went with all Israel. Have I ever spoken to any of the tribes of Israel, which I commanded to tend my people Israel, saying, Why have you° not built me a house of Cedar?  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  008" id="7  008" >8</span>
 And now thus shall you say to my servant David, Thus says the Lord Almighty, I took you from the sheep-cote, that you should be a prince over my people, over Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  009" id="7  009" >9</span>
 And I was with you wherever you went, and I destroyed all your enemies before you, and I made you renowned according to the renown of the great ones on the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  010" id="7  010" >10</span>
 And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   it.  </span>  them, and they shall dwell by themselves, and shall be no more distressed; and the son of iniquity shall no more afflict them, as he   has done   from the beginning,  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  011" id="7  011" >11</span>
 from the days when I appointed judges over my people Israel: and I will give you rest from all your enemies, and the Lord will tell you that you shall build a house to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  012" id="7  012" >12</span>
 And it shall come to pass when your days shall have been fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, that I will raise up your seed after you, even your own issue, and I will establish his kingdom.  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  013" id="7  013" >13</span>
 He shall build for me a house to my name, and I will set up his throne even for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  014" id="7  014" >14</span>
 I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. And when he happens to transgress, then will I chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of men.  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  015" id="7  015" >15</span>
 But my mercy I will not take from him, as I took it from those whom I removed from my presence.  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  016" id="7  016" >16</span>
 And his house shall be made sure, and his kingdom for ever before me, and his throne shall be set up for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  017" id="7  017" >17</span>
 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  018" id="7  018" >18</span>
 And king David came in, and sat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord, my Lord, and what   is   my house, that you have loved me  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   so much as this.  </span>  hitherto?  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  019" id="7  019" >19</span>
 Whereas I was very little before you, O Lord, my Lord, yet you spoke concerning the house of your servant for a long time to   to come  . And   is   this the law of man, O Lord, my Lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  020" id="7  020" >20</span>
 And what shall David yet say to you? and now you know your servant, O Lord, my Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  021" id="7  021" >21</span>
 And you have wrought for your servant's sake, and according to your heart you have wrought all this greatness, to make it known to your servant,  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  022" id="7  022" >22</span>
 that he may magnify you, O my Lord; for there is no one  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   as you.  </span>  like you, and there is no God, but you among all of whom we have heard with our ears.  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  023" id="7  023" >23</span>
 And what other nation in the earth   is   as your people Israel? whereas God was his guide, to redeem for himself a people to make you a name, to do mightily and nobly, so that you should cast out nations an   their   tabernacles from the presence of your people, whom you did redeem for yourself out of Egypt?  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  024" id="7  024" >24</span>
 And you have prepared for yourself your people Israel to be a people for ever, and you, Lord, are become their God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  025" id="7  025" >25</span>
 And now, O my Lord, the Almighty Lord God of Israel, confirm the word for ever which you have spoken concerning your servant and his house: and now as you have said,  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  026" id="7  026" >26</span>
 Let your name be magnified for ever.  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. and   Alex.   add, 'and let the house of your servant David be established before you.'  </span>   <span class="verse" rel="v0107  027" id="7  027" >27</span>
 Almighty Lord God of Israel, you have uncovered the ear of your servant, saying, I will build you a house: therefore your servant has found   in   his heart to pray this prayer to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  028" id="7  028" >28</span>
 And now, O Lord my Lord, you are God; and your words will be true, and you have spoken these good things concerning your servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v0107  029" id="7  029" >29</span>
 And now begin and bless the house of your servant, that it may continue for ever before you; for you, O Lord, my Lord, have spoken, and the house of your servant shall be blessed with your blessing so as to continue for ever.

 And David said, I will show mercy to Annon the son of Naas, as his father dealt mercifully with me.

 And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Annon their lord,   Is it   to honor your father before you that David has sent comforters to you? Has not David rather sent his servants to you that they should search the city, and spy it out and examine it?  <span class="verse" rel="v01010  004" id="10  004" >4</span>
 And Annon took the servants of David, and shaved their beards, and cut off their garments in the midst as far as their haunches, and sent them away.  <span class="verse" rel="v01010  005" id="10  005" >5</span>

 And the children of Ammon saw that the people of David were ashamed; and the children of Ammon sent, and hired the Syrians of Baethraam, and the Syrians of Suba, and Roob, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Amalec with a thousand men, and Istob with twelve thousand men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01010  007" id="10  007" >7</span>

 And the children of Ammon went forth, and set the battle in array by the door of the gate:   those   of Syria, Suba, and Roob, and Istob, and Amalec, being by themselves in the field.  <span class="verse" rel="v01010  009" id="10  009" >9</span>
 And Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him from that which was opposed in front and from behind, and he chose out   some   of all the young men of Israel, and they set themselves in array against Syria.  <span class="verse" rel="v01010  010" id="10  010" >10</span>
 And the rest of the people he gave into the hand of Abessa his brother, and they set the battle in array opposite to the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01010  011" id="10  011" >11</span>

 And the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, and they fled from before Abessa, and entered into the city: and Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01010  015" id="10  015" >15</span>
 And the Syrians saw that they were worsted before Israel, and they gathered themselves together.  <span class="verse" rel="v01010  016" id="10  016" >16</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="11  001">11  </span> And it came to pass when the time o the year for kings going out   to battle   had come round, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbath: but David remained at Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  002" id="11  002" >2</span>
 And it came to pass toward evening, that David arose off his couch, and walked on the roof of the king's house, and saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  003" id="11  003" >3</span>
 And David sent and enquired about the woman: and   one   said,   Is   not this Bersabee the daughter of Eliab, the wife of Urias the Chettite?  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  004" id="11  004" >4</span>
 And David sent messengers, and took her, and went in to her, and he lay with her: and she was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   sanctified.  </span>  purified from her uncleanness, and returned to her house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  005" id="11  005" >5</span>
 And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  006" id="11  006" >6</span>
 And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Urias the Chettite; and Joab sent Urias to David.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  007" id="11  007" >7</span>
 And Urias arrived and went in to him, and David asked him how Joab was, and how the people were, and how the war went on.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  008" id="11  008" >8</span>
 And David said to Urias, Go to your house, and wash your feet: and Urias departed from the house of the king, and a portion   of meat   from the king followed him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  009" id="11  009" >9</span>
 And Urias slept at the door of the king with the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  010" id="11  010" >10</span>
 And they brought David word, saying, Urias has not gone down to his house. And David said to Urias, Are you not come from a journey? why have you not gone down to your house?  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  011" id="11  011" >11</span>
 And Urias said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Juda dwell in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   encamp.  </span>  are encamped in the open fields; and shall I go into my house to eat and drink, and lie with my wife? how   should I do this? as   your soul lives,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   if I do this thing.  </span>  I will not do this thing.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  012" id="11  012" >12</span>
 And David said to Urias, Remain here today also, and to-morrow I will let you go. So Urias remained in Jerusalem that day and the day following.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  013" id="11  013" >13</span>
 And David called him, and he ate before him and drank, and he made him drunk: and he went out in the evening to lie upon his bed with the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  014" id="11  014" >14</span>
 And the morning came, and David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Urias.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  015" id="11  015" >15</span>
 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Station Urias in front of the severe   part   of the fight, and retreat from behind him, so shall he be wounded and die.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  016" id="11  016" >16</span>
 And it came to pass while Joab was watching against the city, that he set Urias in a place where he knew that valiant men were.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  017" id="11  017" >17</span>
 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and some of the people of the servants of David fell, and Urias the Chettite died also.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  018" id="11  018" >18</span>
 And Joab sent, and reported to David all the events of the war,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.   and   Heb. make the verse end here.  </span>  so as to tell them to the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  019" id="11  019" >19</span>
 And he charged the messenger, saying, When you have finished reporting all the events of the war to the king,  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  020" id="11  020" >20</span>
 then it shall come to pass if the anger of the king shall arise, and he shall say to you, Why did you° draw near to the city to fight? knew you° not that they would shoot from off the wall?  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  021" id="11  021" >21</span>
 Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerobaal son of Ner? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from above the wall, and he died in Thamasi? why did you° draw near to the wall? then you shall say, Your servant Urias the Chettite is also dead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  022" id="11  022" >22</span>
 And the messenger of Joab went to the king to Jerusalem, and he came and reported to David all that Joab told him, all the affairs of the war. And David was very angry with Joab, and said to the messenger, Why did you° draw near to the wall to fight? knew you° not that you° would be wounded from off the wall? Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerobaal? did not a woman cast upon him a piece of millstone from the wall, and he died in Thamasi? why did you° draw near to the wall?  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  023" id="11  023" >23</span>
 And the messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us, and they came out against us into the field, and we came upon them even to the door of the gate.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  024" id="11  024" >24</span>
 And the archers shot at your servants from off the wall, and some of the king's servants died, and your servant Urias the Chettite is dead also.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  025" id="11  025" >25</span>
 And David said to the messenger, Thus shall you say to Joab, Let not the matter be grievous in your eyes, for the sword devours one way at one time and another way at another: strengthen your array against the city, and destroy it, and strengthen  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        There can be little doubt that αὐτὸν the   Alex.   reading, is correct, instead of αὐτήν.  </span>  him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  026" id="11  026" >26</span>
 And the wife of Urias heard that Urias her husband was dead, and she mourned for her husband.  <span class="verse" rel="v01011  027" id="11  027" >27</span>
 And the time of mourning expired, and David sent and took her into his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son: but the thing which David did was evil in the eyes of the Lord.

<p><span class="chapter" id="12  001">12  </span> And the Lord sent Nathan the prophet to David; and he went in to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city, one rich and the other poor.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  002" id="12  002" >2</span>
 And the rich   man   had very many flocks and herds.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  003" id="12  003" >3</span>
 But the poor   man had   only one little ewe lamb, which he had purchased, and preserved, and reared; an it grew up with himself and his children in common; it ate of his bread and drank of his cup, and slept in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  004" id="12  004" >4</span>
 And a traveller came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his flocks and of his herds, to dress for the traveller that came to him; and he took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that came to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  005" id="12  005" >5</span>
 And David was greatly moved with anger against the man; and David said to Nathan,   As   the Lord lives, the man that did this thing  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   is the son of death.  </span>  shall surely die.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  006" id="12  006" >6</span>
 And he shall restore the lamb sevenfold, because he has not spared.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  007" id="12  007" >7</span>
 And Nathan said to David, You are the man that has done this. Thus says the Lord God of Israel, I anointed you to be king over Israel, and I rescued you out the hand of Saul;  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  008" id="12  008" >8</span>
 and I gave you the house of your lord, and the wives of your lord into your bosom, and I gave to you the house of Israel and Juda; and if that  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   is little, I will give, etc.  </span>  had been little, I would have given you yet more.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  009" id="12  009" >9</span>
 Why have you set at nothing the word of the Lord, to do that which is evil in his eyes? you have slain Urias the Chettite with the sword, and you have taken his wife to be your wife, and you have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  010" id="12  010" >10</span>
 Now therefore the sword shall not depart from your house for ever, because you have set me at nothing, and you have taken the wife of Urias the Chettite, to be your wife.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  011" id="12  011" >11</span>
 Thus says the Lord, Behold, I will raise up against you evil out of your house, and I will take your wives before your eyes, and will give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  012" id="12  012" >12</span>
 For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing in the sight of all Israel, and before the sun.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  013" id="12  013" >13</span>
 And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord. And Nathan said to David, And the Lord has put away your sin; you shall not die.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  014" id="12  014" >14</span>
 Only because you have given great occasion of provocation to the enemies of the Lord by this thing, your son also  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   born.  </span>  that is born to you shall surely die.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  015" id="12  015" >15</span>
 And Nathan departed to his house. And the Lord struck the child, which the wife of Urias the Chettite bore to David, and it was ill.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  016" id="12  016" >16</span>
 And David enquired of God concerning the child, and David fasted, and went in and lay all night upon the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  017" id="12  017" >17</span>
 And the elders of his house arose   and went   to him to raise him up from the ground, but he would not   rise  , nor did he eat bread with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  018" id="12  018" >18</span>
 And it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died: and the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive we spoke to him, and he listened not to our voice; and you should we tell him that the child is dead?—so  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   will.  </span>  would he do   himself   harm.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  019" id="12  019" >19</span>
 And David understood that his servants were whispering, and David perceived that the child was dead: and David said to his servants, Is the child dead? and they said, He is dead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  020" id="12  020" >20</span>
 Then David rose up from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his raiment, and went into the house of God, and worshipped him; and went into his own house, and called for bread to eat, and they set bread before him and he ate.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  021" id="12  021" >21</span>
 And his servants said to him, What   is   this thing that you have done concerning the child? while it was yet living you did fast, and weep, and watch: and when the child was dead you did rise up, and did eat bread, and drink.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  022" id="12  022" >22</span>
 And David said, While the child yet lived, I fasted and wept; for I said, Who knows if the Lord will pity me, and the child live?  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  023" id="12  023" >23</span>
 But now it is dead, why should I fast thus? shall I be able to bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  024" id="12  024" >24</span>
 And David comforted Bersabee his wife, and he went in to her, and lay with her; and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his named Solomon, and the Lord loved him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  025" id="12  025" >25</span>
 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and called his name Jeddedi, for the Lord's sake.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  026" id="12  026" >26</span>
 And Joab fought against Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  027" id="12  027" >27</span>
 And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbath, and taken the city of waters.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  028" id="12  028" >28</span>
 And now gather the rest of the people, and encamp against the city, an take it beforehand; lest I take the city first, and my name be called upon it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  029" id="12  029" >29</span>
 And David gathered all the people, and went to Rabbath, and fought against it, and took it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  030" id="12  030" >30</span>
 And he took the crown of  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.   rightly omits Molchom. 'Their king' in   Heb.  </span>  Molchom their king from off his head, and the weight of it was a talent of gold, with precious stones, and it was upon the head of David; and he carried forth very much spoil of the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v01012  031" id="12  031" >31</span>
 And he brought forth the people that were in it, and put them  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in.  </span>  under the saw, and under iron harrows, and axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus he did to all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

<p><span class="chapter" id="13  001">13  </span> And it happened after this that Abessalom the son of David had a very beautiful sister, and her name   was   Themar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  002" id="13  002" >2</span>
 And Amnon was distressed even to sickness, because of Themar his sister; for she was a virgin, and it seemed very difficult for Amnon to do anything to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  003" id="13  003" >3</span>
 And Amnon had a friend, and his name   was   Jonadab, the son of Samaa the brother of David: and Jonadab   was   a very cunning man.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  004" id="13  004" >4</span>
 And he said to him, What ails you that you are thus weak? O son of the king, morning by morning?  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   do.  </span>  will you not tell me? and Ammon said, I love Themar the sister of my brother Abessalom.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  005" id="13  005" >5</span>
 And Jonadab said to him, Lie upon your bed, and make yourself sick, and your father shall come in to see you; and you shall say to him, Let, I pray you, Themar my sister come, and feed me with morsels, and let her prepare food before my eyes, that I may see and eat at her hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  006" id="13  006" >6</span>
 So Ammon lay down, and made himself sick; and the king came in to see him: and Amnon said to the king, Let, I pray you, my sister Themar come to me, and make a couple of cakes in my sight, and I will eat them at her hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  007" id="13  007" >7</span>
 And David sent to Themar to the house, saying, Go now to your brother's house, and dress him food.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  008" id="13  008" >8</span>
 And Themar went to the house of her brother Amnon, and he   was   lying down: and she took the dough and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  009" id="13  009" >9</span>
 And she took the frying pan and poured them out before him, but he would not eat. And Amnon said, Send out every man from  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   above.  </span>  about me. And they removed every man from about him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  010" id="13  010" >10</span>
 And Amnon said to Themar, Bring in the food into the closet, and I will eat of your hand. And Themar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them to her brother Amnon into the chamber.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  011" id="13  011" >11</span>
 And she brought   them   to him to eat, and he caught hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  012" id="13  012" >12</span>
 And she said to him, Nay, my brother, do not humble me, for it  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   will not.   q.d.   non est fasciendum.  </span>  ought not to be so done in Israel; do not this folly.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  013" id="13  013" >13</span>
 And I, whither shall I remove my reproach? and you shall be as one of the fools in Israel. And now, speak, I pray you, to the king, for surely he will not keep me from you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  014" id="13  014" >14</span>
 But Amnon would not listen to her voice; and he prevailed against her, and humbled her, and lay with her.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  015" id="13  015" >15</span>
 Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her, for the last wickedness was greater than the first: and Amnon said to her, Rise, and be gone.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  016" id="13  016" >16</span>
 And Themar spoke to him concerning this great mischief, greater,   said she  , than the other that you did me, to send me away: but Amnon would not listen to her voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  017" id="13  017" >17</span>
 And he called his servant who had charge of the house, and said to him, Put now this   woman   out from me, and shut the door after her.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  018" id="13  018" >18</span>
 And she had on her a variegated robe, for so were the king's daughters that were virgins attired in their apparel: and his servant led her forth, and shut the door after her.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  019" id="13  019" >19</span>
 And Themar took ashes, and put them on her head; and she tore the variegated garment that was upon her: and she laid her hands on her head, and went crying continually.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  020" id="13  020" >20</span>
 And Abessalom her brother said to her, Has your brother Amnon been with you? now then, my sister, be silent, for he is your brother: be not careful to mention this matter. So Themar lived as a widow in the house of her brother Abessalom.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  021" id="13  021" >21</span>
 And king David heard of all these things, and was very angry; but he did not grieve the spirit of his son Amnon, because be loved him, for he was his firstborn.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  022" id="13  022" >22</span>
 And Abessalom spoke not to Amnon, good or bad, because Abessalom hated Amnon, on account of his humbling his sister Themar.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  023" id="13  023" >23</span>
 And it came to pass at the end of  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        q.d.   a two-year of days.  </span>  two whole years, that they were shearing   sheep   for Abessalom in Belasor near Ephraim: and Abessalom invited all the king's sons.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  024" id="13  024" >24</span>
 And Abessalom came to the king, and said, Behold,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   they are shearing for your servant.  </span>  your servant has a sheep-shearing; let now the king and his servants go with your servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  025" id="13  025" >25</span>
 And the king said to Abessalom, Nay, my son, let us not all go, and let us not be burdensome to you. And he pressed him; but he would not go, but blessed him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  026" id="13  026" >26</span>
 And Abessalom said to him, And if not, let I pray you, my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with you?  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  027" id="13  027" >27</span>
 And Abessalom pressed him, and he sent with him Amnon and all the king's sons; and Abessalom made a banquet like the banquet of the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  028" id="13  028" >28</span>
 And Abessalom charged his servants, saying, Mark when the heart of Amnon shall be merry with wine, and I shall say to you, Strike Amnon, and kill him: fear not; for is it not I that command you? Be courageous,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and become sons of strength.  </span>  and be valiant.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  029" id="13  029" >29</span>
 And the servants of Abessalom did to Amnon as Abessalom commanded them: and all the sons of the king rose up, and they mounted every man his mule, and fled.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  030" id="13  030" >30</span>
 And it came to pass, when they were in the way, that a report came to David, saying, Abessalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  031" id="13  031" >31</span>
 Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay upon the ground: and all his servants that were standing round him tore their garments.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  032" id="13  032" >32</span>
 And Jonadab the son of Samaa brother of David, answered and said, Let not my Lord the king say that he has slain all the young men the sons of the king, for Amnon only of them all is dead; for he was appointed   to death   by the mouth of Abessalom from the day that he humbled his sister Themar.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  033" id="13  033" >33</span>
 And now let not my lord the king take the matter to heart, saying, All the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only of them is dead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  034" id="13  034" >34</span>
 And Abessalom escaped: and the young man the watchman, lifted up his eyes, and looked; and, behold, much people went in the way behind him from the side of the mountain in the descent: and the watchman came and told the king, and said, I have seen men by the way of Oronen, by the side of the mountain.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  035" id="13  035" >35</span>
 And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons are present: according to the word of your servant, so has it happened.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  036" id="13  036" >36</span>
 And it came to pass when he had finished speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voices and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept with a very great weeping.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  037" id="13  037" >37</span>
 But Abessalom fled, and went to Tholmi son of Emiud the king of Gedsur to the land of Chamaachad: and king David mourned for his son continually.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  038" id="13  038" >38</span>
 So Abessalom fled, and departed to Gedsur, and was there three years.  <span class="verse" rel="v01013  039" id="13  039" >39</span>
 And king David ceased to go out after Abessalom, for he was comforted concerning Amnon, touching his death.  
<!-- 14   039 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="14  001">14  </span> And Joab the son of Saruia knew that the heart of the king was toward Abessalom.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  002" id="14  002" >2</span>
 And Joab sent to Thecoe, and took thence a cunning woman, and said to her, Mourn, I pray you, and put on mourning apparel, and anoint you not with oil, and you shall be as a woman mourning for one that is dead thus for many days.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  003" id="14  003" >3</span>
 And you shall go to the king, and speak to him according to this word. And Joab put the words in her mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  004" id="14  004" >4</span>
 So the woman of Thecoe went in to the king and fell upon her face to the earth, and did him obeisance, and said,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   save.  </span>  Help, O king, help.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  005" id="14  005" >5</span>
 And the king said to her, What is the matter with you? And she said, I am indeed a widow woman, and my husband is dead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  006" id="14  006" >6</span>
 And moreover your handmaid had two sons, and they fought  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   both.  </span>  together in the field, and there was no one to part them; and the one struck the other his brother, and killed him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  007" id="14  007" >7</span>
 And behold the whole family rose up against your handmaid, and they said, Give up the one that struck his brother, and we will put him to death for the life of his brother, whom he killed, and we will take away even your heir: so they will quench my coal that is left, so as not to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   place.  </span>  leave my husband remnant or name on the face of the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  008" id="14  008" >8</span>
 And the king said to the woman, Go  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in health.  </span>  in peace to your house, and I will give commandment concerning you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  009" id="14  009" >9</span>
 And the woman of Thecoe said to the king, On me, my lord, O king, and on my father's house   be   the iniquity, and the king and his throne   be   guiltless.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  010" id="14  010" >10</span>
 And the king said, Who was it that spoke to you? you shall even bring him to me, and   one   shall not touch  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        q.d.   your son.  </span>  him any more.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  011" id="14  011" >11</span>
 And she said, Let now the king remember concerning his Lord God in that the avenger of blood is multiplied to destroy, and let them not take away my son. And he said,   As   the lord lives, not a hair of your son shall fall to the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  012" id="14  012" >12</span>
 And the woman said, Let now your servant speak a word to my lord the king. And he said, Say on.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  013" id="14  013" >13</span>
 And the woman said, Why have you devised this thing against the people of God? or   is   this word out of the king's mouth as a transgression, so that the king should not bring back his banished?  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  014" id="14  014" >14</span>
 For we shall surely die, and be as water poured upon the earth, which shall not be gathered up, and God shall take the life, even as he devises to thrust forth from him his outcast.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  015" id="14  015" >15</span>
 And now whereas I came to speak this word to my lord the king,   the reason is   that the people will see me, and your handmaid will say, Let one now speak to my lord the king, if perhaps the king will perform the request of his handmaid;  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  016" id="14  016" >16</span>
 for the king will hear. Let him rescue his handmaid out of the hand of the man that seeks to cast out me and my son from the inheritance of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  017" id="14  017" >17</span>
 And the woman said, If now the word of my lord the king be gracious, —  well  : for as an angel of God, so   is   my lord the king, to hear good and evil: and the Lord your God shall be with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  018" id="14  018" >18</span>
 And the king answered, and said to the woman, Hide not from me, I pray you, the matter which I ask you. And the woman said, Let my lord the king by all means speak.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  019" id="14  019" >19</span>
 And the king said,   Is   not the hand of Joab in all this matter with you? and the woman said to the king,   As   your soul lives, my lord, O king, <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   If there is, etc.  </span>  there is no turning to the right hand or to the left from all that my lord the king has spoken; for your servant Joab himself charged me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  020" id="14  020" >20</span>
 In order that this form of speech might come about   it was   that your servant Joab has framed this matter: and my lord is wise as   is   the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  021" id="14  021" >21</span>
 And the king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done to you according to this your word: go, bring back the young man Abessalom.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  022" id="14  022" >22</span>
 And Joab fell on his face to the ground, and did obeisance, and blessed the king: and Joab said, To-day your servant knows that I have found grace in your sight, my lord, O king, for my lord the king has performed the request of his servant.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  023" id="14  023" >23</span>
 And Joab arose, and went to Gedsur, and brought Abessalom to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  024" id="14  024" >24</span>
 And the king said, Let him return to his house, and not see my face. And Abessalom returned to his house, and saw not the king's face.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  025" id="14  025" >25</span>
 And there was not a man in Israel so  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   praised.  </span>  very comely as Abessalom: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  026" id="14  026" >26</span>
 And when he polled his head, (and it was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from the beginning of days to days.   Hebraism. </span>  at the beginning of every year that he polled it, because it grew, heavy upon him,) even when he polled it, he weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels according to the royal shekel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  027" id="14  027" >27</span>
 And there were born to Abessalom three sons and one daughter, and her name was Themar: she was a very beautiful woman, and she becomes the wife of Roboam son of Solomon, and she bears to him Abia.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  028" id="14  028" >28</span>
 And Abessalom remained in Jerusalem two  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   years of days.  </span>  full years, and he saw not the king's face.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  029" id="14  029" >29</span>
 And Abessalom sent to Joab to bring him in to the king, and he would not come to him: and he sent to him the second time, and he would not come.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  030" id="14  030" >30</span>
 And Abessalom said to his servants, Behold, Joab's portion in the field   is   next to mine, and he has in it barley; go and set it on fire. And the servants of Abessalom set the field on fire: and the servants of Joab come to him with their clothes tore, and they said to him, The servants of Abessalom have set the field on fire.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  031" id="14  031" >31</span>
 And Joab arose, and came to Abessalom into the house, and said to him, Why have your servants set my field on fire?  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  032" id="14  032" >32</span>
 And Abessalom said to Joab, Behold, I sent to you, saying, Come hither, and I will send you to the king, saying, Why did I come out of Gedsur? it would have been better for me to have remained there: and now, behold, I have not seen the face of the king; but if there is iniquity in me, then put me to death.  <span class="verse" rel="v01014  033" id="14  033" >33</span>
 And Joab went in to the king, and brought him word: and he called Abessalom, and he went in to the king, and did him obeisance, and fell upon his face to the ground, even in the presence of the king; and the king kissed Abessalom.

<p><span class="chapter" id="15  001">15  </span> And it came to pass after this that Abessalom  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   made.  </span>  prepared for himself chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  002" id="15  002" >2</span>
 And Abessalom rose early, and stood by the side of the way of the gate: and it came to pass that every man who had a cause, came to the king for judgment, and Abessalom cried to him, and said to him, Of what city are you? And he said, Your servant   is   of one of the tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  003" id="15  003" >3</span>
 And Abessalom said to him, See, your affairs   are   right and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   easy to be understood.  </span>  clear, yet you have no one   appointed   of the king to hear you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  004" id="15  004" >4</span>
 And Abessalom said, O that one would make me a judge in the land; then every man who had a dispute or a cause would come to me, and I would judge him!  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  005" id="15  005" >5</span>
 And it came to pass when a man came near to do him obeisance, that he stretched out his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  006" id="15  006" >6</span>
 And Abessalom did after this manner to all Israel that came to the king for judgment; and Abessalom gained the hearts of the men of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  007" id="15  007" >7</span>
 And it came to pass  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   from the end of, etc.  </span>  after forty years, that Abessalom said to his father, I will go now, and pay my vows, which I vowed to the Lord in Chebron.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  008" id="15  008" >8</span>
 For your servant vowed a vow when I lived at Gedsur in Syria, saying, If the Lord should indeed restore me to Jerusalem, then will I serve the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  009" id="15  009" >9</span>
 And the king said to him, Go in peace. And he arose and went to Chebron.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  010" id="15  010" >10</span>
 And Abessalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, When you° hear the sound of the trumpet, then shall you° say, Abessalom is become king in Chebron.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  011" id="15  011" >11</span>
 And there went with Abessalom two hundred chosen men from Jerusalem; and they went in their simplicity, and knew not anything.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  012" id="15  012" >12</span>
 And Abessalom sent to Achitophel the Theconite, the counsellor of David, from his city, from Gola, where he was sacrificing: and there was a strong  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        So the   Alex.   which reads σὺστρεμμα. See Acts 23.12.  </span>  conspiracy; and the people with Abessalom were increasingly numerous.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  013" id="15  013" >13</span>
 And there came a messenger to David, saying, the heart of the men of Israel is gone after Abessalom.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  014" id="15  014" >14</span>
 And David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem, Rise, and let us flee, for we have no refuge from Abessalom: make haste and go, lest he overtake us speedily, and bring evil upon us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  015" id="15  015" >15</span>
 And the king's servants said to the king, In all things which our lord the king chooses, behold   we are   your servants.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  016" id="15  016" >16</span>
 And the king and all his house went out on foot: and the king left ten women of his concubines to keep the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  017" id="15  017" >17</span>
 And the king and all his servants went out on foot; and abode in a distant house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  018" id="15  018" >18</span>
 And all his servants passed on by his  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   hand.  </span>  side, and every Chelethite, and every Phelethite, and they stood by the olive tree in the wilderness: and all the people marched near him, and all his court, and all the men of might, and all the men of war, six hundred: and they were present at his side: and every Chelethite, and every Phelethite, and all the six hundred Gittites that came on foot out of Geth, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   they that.  </span>  they went on before the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  019" id="15  019" >19</span>
 And the king said to Ethi, the Gittite, Why do you also go with us? return, and dwell with the king, for you are a stranger, and you have come forth as a sojourner out of your place.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  020" id="15  020" >20</span>
   <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   it.  </span>  Whereas you came yesterday, shall I today cause you to travel with us, and shall you   thus   change your place? you did come forth yesterday, and today shall I set you in motion to go along with us? I indeed will go wherever I may go: return then, and cause your brethren to return with you, and may the Lord deal mercifully and truly with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  021" id="15  021" >21</span>
 And Ethi answered the king and said,   As   the Lord lives and as my lord the king lives, in the place wherever my lord shall be, whether it be for death or life, there shall your servant be.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  022" id="15  022" >22</span>
 And the king said to Ethi, Come and pass over with me. So Ethi the Gittite and the king passed over, and all his servants, and all the multitude with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  023" id="15  023" >23</span>
 And all the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   land.  </span>  country wept with a loud voice. And all the people passed by  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in.  </span>  over the brook of Kedron; and the king crossed the brook Kedron: and all the people and the king passed on toward the way of the wilderness.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  024" id="15  024" >24</span>
 And behold also Sadoc, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord from Baethar: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had passed out of the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  025" id="15  025" >25</span>
 And the king said to Sadoc, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I should find favor in the eyes of the Lord, then will he bring me back, and he will show me it and its beauty.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  026" id="15  026" >26</span>
 But if he should say thus, I have no pleasure in you; behold,   here   I am, let him do to me according to that which is good in his eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  027" id="15  027" >27</span>
 And the king said to Sadoc the priest, Behold, you  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   do.  </span>  shall return to the city in peace, and Achimaas your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, your two sons with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  028" id="15  028" >28</span>
 Behold, I continue in arms in Araboth of the desert, until there come tidings from you to report to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  029" id="15  029" >29</span>
 So Sadoc and Abiathar brought back the ark of the Lord to Jerusalem, and it continued there.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  030" id="15  030" >30</span>
 And David went up by the ascent of   the mount of   Olives, ascending and weeping, and had his head covered, and went barefooted: and all the people that were with him covered   every   man his head; and they went up, ascending and weeping.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  031" id="15  031" >31</span>
 And it was reported to David, saying, Achitophel also   is   among the conspirators with Abessalom. And David said, O Lord my God, disconcert, I pray you, the counsel of Achitophel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  032" id="15  032" >32</span>
 And David came as far as Ros, where he worshipped God: and behold, Chusi the chief friend of David came out to meet him, having tore his garment, and earth   was   upon his head.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  033" id="15  033" >33</span>
 And David said to him, If you should go over with me, then will you be a burden to me;  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  034" id="15  034" >34</span>
 but if you shall return to the city, and shall say to Abessalom, Your brethren are passed over, and the king your father is passed over after me: and now I am your servant, O king, suffer me to live: at one time even of late I was the servant of your father, and now I   am   your humble servant—so shall you disconcert for me, the counsel of Achitophel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  035" id="15  035" >35</span>
 And, behold,   there are   there with you Sadoc and Abiathar the priests; and it shall be that every word that you shall hear of the house of the king, you shall report it to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  036" id="15  036" >36</span>
 Behold,   there are   there with them their two sons, Achimaas the son of Sadoc, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar; and by them you° shall report to me every word which you° shall hear.  <span class="verse" rel="v01015  037" id="15  037" >37</span>
 So Chusi the friend of David went into the city, and Abessalom was lately gone into Jerusalem.  
<!-- 16   037 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="16  001">16  </span> And David passed on a little way from Ros; and, behold, Siba the servant of Memphibosthe   came   to meet him; and he had a couple of asses laden, and upon them two hundred loaves, and a hundred   bunches of   raisins, and a hundred   cakes of   dates, and bottle of wine.  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  002" id="16  002" >2</span>
 And the king said to Siba, What meanest you by these? and Siba, said, The asses   are   for the household of the king to sit upon, and the loaves and the dates   are   for the young men to eat, and the wine   is   for them that are faint in the wilderness to drink.  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  003" id="16  003" >3</span>
 And the king said, And where   is   the son of your master? and Siba said to the king, Behold, he remains in Jerusalem; for he said, To-day shall the house of Israel restore to me the kingdom of my father.  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  004" id="16  004" >4</span>
 And the king said to Siba, Behold, all Memphibosthe's property   is   your. And Siba did obeisance and said, My lord, O king, let me find grace in your eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  005" id="16  005" >5</span>
 And king David came to Baurim; and, behold, there came out from thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, and his name   was   Semei the son of Gera. He came forth and cursed as he went,  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  006" id="16  006" >6</span>
 and cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on the right and left hand of the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  007" id="16  007" >7</span>
 And thus Semei said when he cursed him, Go out, go out, you bloody man, and man of sin.  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  008" id="16  008" >8</span>
 The Lord has returned upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, because you have reigned in his stead; and the Lord has given the kingdom into the hand of Abessalom your son: and, behold, you   are taken   in your mischief, because you   are   a bloody man.  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  009" id="16  009" >9</span>
 And Abessa the son of Saruia said to the king, Why does this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over now and take off his head.  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  010" id="16  010" >10</span>
 And the king said, What have I to do with you, you° sons of Saruia? even let him alone, and so let him curse, for the Lord has told him to curse David: and who shall say, Why have you done thus?  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  011" id="16  011" >11</span>
 And David said to Abessa and to all his servants, Behold, my son who came forth out of my bowels seeks my life; still more now may the son of Benjamin: let him curse, because the Lord has told him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  012" id="16  012" >12</span>
 If by any means the Lord may look on my affliction, thus shall he return me good for his cursing this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  013" id="16  013" >13</span>
 And David and all the men with him went on the way: and Semei went by the side of the hill next to him, cursing as he went, and casting stones  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   obliquely, etc.  </span>  at him, and sprinkling him with dirt.  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  014" id="16  014" >14</span>
 And the king, and all the people with him, came away and refreshed themselves there.  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  015" id="16  015" >15</span>
 And Abessalom and all the men of Israel went into Jerusalem, and Achitophel with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  016" id="16  016" >16</span>
 And it came to pass when Chusi the chief friend of David came to Abessalom, that Chusi said to Abessalom, Let the king live.  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  017" id="16  017" >17</span>
 And Abessalom said to Chusi,   Is   this your kindness to your friend? why went you not forth with your friend?  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  018" id="16  018" >18</span>
 And Chusi said to Abessalom, Nay, but following whom the Lord, and this people, and all Israel have chosen, —his will I be, and with him I will dwell.  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  019" id="16  019" >19</span>
 And again, whom shall I serve? should I not in the presence of his son? As I served in the sight of your father, so will I be in your presence.  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  020" id="16  020" >20</span>
 And Abessalom said to Achitophel, Deliberate among yourselves concerning what we should do.  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  021" id="16  021" >21</span>
 And Achitophel said to Abessalom, Go in to your father's concubines, whom he left to keep his house; and all Israel shall hear that you have dishonored your father; and the hands of all that are with you shall be strengthened.  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  022" id="16  022" >22</span>
 And they pitched a tent for Abessalom on the roof, and Abessalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01016  023" id="16  023" >23</span>
 And the counsel of Achitophel, which he counselled in former days,   was   as if one should enquire of the word of God: so   was   all the counsel of Achitophel both to David and also to Abessalom.  
<!-- 17   023 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="17  001">17  </span> And Achitophel said to Abessalom, Let me now choose out for myself twelve thousand men, and I will arise and follow after David this night:  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  002" id="17  002" >2</span>
 and I will come upon him when he   is   weary and weak-handed, and I will strike him with terror; and all the people with him shall flee, and I will strike the king only of all.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  003" id="17  003" >3</span>
 And I will bring back all the people to you, as a bride returns to her husband: only you seek the life of one man, and all the people shall have peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  004" id="17  004" >4</span>
 And the saying   was   right in the eyes of Abessalom, and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  005" id="17  005" >5</span>
 And Abessalom said, Call now also Chusi the Arachite, and let us hear what   is   in his mouth, even in his also.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  006" id="17  006" >6</span>
 And Chusi went in to Abessalom, and Abessalom spoke to him, saying, After this manner spoke Achitophel: shall we do according to his word? but if not, do you speak.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  007" id="17  007" >7</span>
 And Chusi said to Abessalom, This counsel which Achitophel has counselled this one time   is   not good.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  008" id="17  008" >8</span>
 And Chusi said, You know your father and his men, that they are very mighty, and bitter in their spirit, as a bereaved bear in the field,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. and   Alex.   omit the wods in italics.  </span>    and as a wild boar in the plain  : and your father   is   a man of war, and will not give the people rest.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  009" id="17  009" >9</span>
 For, behold, he is now hidden in one of the hills or in some   other   place: and it shall come to pass when he falls upon them at the beginning, that   some one   will certainly hear, and say, There has been a slaughter among the people that follow after Abessalom.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  010" id="17  010" >10</span>
 Then even he   that is    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a son of strength.  </span>  strong, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, —it shall utterly melt: for all Israel knows that your father   is   mighty, and they that are with him   are   mighty men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  011" id="17  011" >11</span>
 For thus I have surely given counsel, that all Israel be generally gathered to you from Dan even to Bersabee, as the sand that is upon the sea-shore for multitude: and that your presence  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   going.  </span>  go in the midst of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  012" id="17  012" >12</span>
 And we will come upon him in one of the places where we shall find him, and we will encamp against him, as the dew falls upon the earth; and we will not leave of him and of his men so much as one.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  013" id="17  013" >13</span>
 And if he shall have taken refuge with his army in a city, then shall all Israel take ropes to that city, and we will draw it even into the river, that there may not be left there even a stone.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  014" id="17  014" >14</span>
 And Abessalom, and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Chusi the Arachite   is   better than the counsel of Achitophel. For the Lord ordained to disconcert the good counsel of Achitophel, that the Lord might bring all evil upon Abessalom.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  015" id="17  015" >15</span>
 And Chusi the Arachite said to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus Achitophel counselled Abessalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  016" id="17  016" >16</span>
 And now send quickly and report to David, saying, Lodge not this night in Araboth of the wilderness: even go and make haste, lest   one    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.   καταπίῃ.  </span>  swallow up the king, and all the people with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  017" id="17  017" >17</span>
 And Jonathan and Achimaas stood by the well of Rogel, and a maidservant went and reported to them, and they go and tell king David; for they might not be seen to enter into the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  018" id="17  018" >18</span>
 But a young man saw them and told Abessalom: and the two went quickly, and entered into the house of a man in Baurim; and he had a well in his court, and they went down into it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  019" id="17  019" >19</span>
 And a woman took a covering, and spread it over the mouth of the well, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        See Num 11. 32. Jerem 8. 2.  </span>  spread out ground corn upon it to dry, and the thing was not known.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  020" id="17  020" >20</span>
 And the servants of Abessalom came to the woman into the house, and said, Where   are   Achimaas and Jonathan? and the woman said to them, They are  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   lately gone over.  </span>  gone a little way beyond  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   the small streams.  </span>  the water. And they sought and found them not, and returned to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  021" id="17  021" >21</span>
 And it came to pass after they were gone, that they came up out of the pit, and went on their way; and reported to king David, and said to David, Arise you° and go quickly over the water, for thus has Achitophel counselled concerning you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  022" id="17  022" >22</span>
 And David rose up and all the people with him, and they passed over Jordan till the morning light; there was not one missing who did not pass over Jordan.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  023" id="17  023" >23</span>
 And Achitophel saw that his counsel was not followed, and he saddled his ass, and rose and departed to his house into his city; and he gave orders to his household, and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Comp. the Greek with Matt 27. 5.  </span>  hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  024" id="17  024" >24</span>
 And David passed over to Manaim: and Abessalom crossed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  025" id="17  025" >25</span>
 And Abessalom appointed Amessai in the room of Joab over the host. And Amessai was the son of a man  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and his name, etc.  </span>  whose name was Jether of Jezrael: he went in to Abigaia the daughter of Naas, the sister of Saruia the mother of Joab.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  026" id="17  026" >26</span>
 And all Israel and Abessalom encamped in the land of Galaad.  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  027" id="17  027" >27</span>
 And it came to pass when David came to Manaim, that Uesbi the son of Naas of Rabbath of the sons of Ammon, and Machir son of Amiel of Lodabar, and Berzelli the Galaadite of Rogellim,  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  028" id="17  028" >28</span>
 brought ten embroidered beds, (with double coverings,) and ten caldrons, and earthenware, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and meal, and beans, and pulse,  <span class="verse" rel="v01017  029" id="17  029" >29</span>
 and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheeses of kine: and they brought them to David and to his people with him to eat; for   one   said, The people   is   faint and hungry and thirsty in the wilderness.

<p><span class="chapter" id="18  001">18  </span> And David numbered the people with him, and set over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  002" id="18  002" >2</span>
 And David sent away the people, the third part  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in, by.  </span>  under the hand of Joab, and the third part under the hand of Abessa the son of Saruia, the brother of Joab, and the third part under the hand of Ethi the Gittite. And David said to the people, I also will surely go out with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  003" id="18  003" >3</span>
 And they said, You shall not go out: for if we should indeed flee, they will not care for us; and if half of us should die, they will not mind us; for you   are    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   as we, ten thousand.  </span>  as ten thousand of us: and now   it is   well that you shall be to us an aid to help us in the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  004" id="18  004" >4</span>
 And the king said to them, Whatsoever shall seem good in your eyes I will do. And the king stood by the  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   hand.  </span>  side of the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  005" id="18  005" >5</span>
 And the king commanded Joab and Abessa and Ethi, saying, Spare for my sake the young man Abessalom. And all the people heard the king charging all the commanders concerning Abessalom.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  006" id="18  006" >6</span>
 And all the people went out into the wood against Israel; and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  007" id="18  007" >7</span>
 And the people of Israel fell down there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter in that day,   even   twenty thousand men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  008" id="18  008" >8</span>
 And the battle there was scattered over the face of all the land: and the wood consumed more of the people than the sword consumed among the people in that day.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  009" id="18  009" >9</span>
 And Abessalom went to meet the servants of David: and Abessalom was mounted on his mule, and the mule came under the thick boughs of a great oak; and his head was entangled in the oak, and he was suspended between heaven and earth; and the mule passed on from under him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  010" id="18  010" >10</span>
 And a man saw it, and reported to Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Abessalom hanging in an oak.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  011" id="18  011" >11</span>
 And Joab said to the man who reported it to him, And, behold, you did see him: why did you not strike him there to the ground? and I would have given you ten   pieces   of silver, and a girdle.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  012" id="18  012" >12</span>
 And the man said to Joab, Were I even to  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   weigh upon my nanda.  </span>  receive a thousand shekels of silver, I would not lift my hand against the king's son; for in our ears the king charged you and Abessa and Ethi, saying, Take care of the young man Abessalom for me,  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  013" id="18  013" >13</span>
 so as to do no harm to his life: and nothing of the matter will be concealed from the king, and you will set yourself against me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  014" id="18  014" >14</span>
 And Joab said, I will begin this; I will not thus remain with you. And Joab took three darts in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Abessalom, while he was yet alive in the heart of the oak.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  015" id="18  015" >15</span>
 And ten young men that bore Joab's armor compassed Abessalom, and struck him and killed him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  016" id="18  016" >16</span>
 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel, for Joab spared the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  017" id="18  017" >17</span>
 And he took Abessalom, and cast him into a great cavern in the wood, into a deep pit, and set up over him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled every man to his tent.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  018" id="18  018" >18</span>
 Now Abessalom while yet alive had taken and set up for himself the pillar  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   in, or by.  </span>  near which he was taken, and set it up so as to have the pillar in the king's dale; for he said he had no son to keep his name in remembrance:  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. and   Alex.   insert 'and he called the pillar after his own name.'  </span>  and he called the pillar, Abessalom's  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. idiom for 'place.'  </span>  hand, until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  019" id="18  019" >19</span>
 And Achimaas the son of Sadoc said, Let me run now and carry glad tidings to the king, for the Lord has delivered him from the hand of his enemies.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  020" id="18  020" >20</span>
 And Joab said to him, You   shall   not   be   a messenger of glad tidings this day; you shall bear them another day; but on this day you shall bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  021" id="18  021" >21</span>
 And Joab said to Chusi, Go, report to the king all that you have seen. And Chusi did obeisance to Joab, and went out.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  022" id="18  022" >22</span>
 And Achimaas the son of Sadoc said again to Joab, Nay, let me also run after Chusi. And Joab said, Why  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   do.  </span>  would you thus run, my son? attend, you have no tidings for profit if you go.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  023" id="18  023" >23</span>
 And he said,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   for what if I should run?.  </span>  Why should I not run? and Joab said to him, Run. And Achimaas ran along the way of Kechar, and outran Chusi.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  024" id="18  024" >24</span>
 And David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up on the top of the gate of the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone before him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  025" id="18  025" >25</span>
 And the watchman cried out, and reported to the king. And the king said, If he be alone,   there are   good tidings in his mouth. And the man came and drew near.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  026" id="18  026" >26</span>
 And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman cried at the gate, and said, And look, another man running alone. And the king said, He also brings glad tidings.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  027" id="18  027" >27</span>
 And the watchman said, I see the running of the first as the running of Achimaas the son of Sadoc. And the king said, He   is   a good man, and will come to   report   glad tidings.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  028" id="18  028" >28</span>
 And Achimaas cried out and said to the king, Peace. And he did obeisance to the king with his face to the ground, and said, Blessed   be   the Lord your God, who has delivered up the men that lifted up their hands against my lord the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  029" id="18  029" >29</span>
 And the king said,   Is   the young man Abessalom safe? and Achimaas said, I saw a great multitude   at the time   of Joab's sending the king's servant and your servant, and I knew not what was there.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  030" id="18  030" >30</span>
 And the king said, Turn aside, stand still here. And he turned aside, and stood.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  031" id="18  031" >31</span>
 And, behold, Chusi came up, and said to the king, Let my lord the king hear glad tidings, for the Lord has avenged you this day upon all them that rose up against you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  032" id="18  032" >32</span>
 And the king said to Chusi, Is it well with the young man Abessalom? and Chusi said, Let the enemies of my lord the king, and all whoever have risen up against him for evil, be as that young man.  <span class="verse" rel="v01018  033" id="18  033" >33</span>
 And the king was troubled, and went to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and thus he said as he went, My son Abessalom, my son, my son Abessalom;  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   who will give my death for you?.  </span>  would God I had died for you,   even   I   had died   for you, Abessalom, my son, my son!

<p><span class="chapter" id="19  001">19  </span> And they brought Joab word, saying, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Abessalom.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  002" id="19  002" >2</span>
 And the victory was turned that day into mourning to all the people, for the people heard say that day, The king grieves after his son.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  003" id="19  003" >3</span>
 And the people stole away that day to go into the city, as people steal away when they are ashamed as they flee in the battle.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  004" id="19  004" >4</span>
 And the king hid his face: and the king cried with a loud voice, My son Abessalom! Abessalom my son!  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  005" id="19  005" >5</span>
 And Joab went in to the king, into the house, and said, You have this day shamed the faces of all your servants that have delivered you this day, and   have saved   the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and of your concubines,  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  006" id="19  006" >6</span>
 forasmuch as you love them that hate you, and hate them that love you; and you have this day declared, that your princes and your servants are nothing   in your sight  : for I know this day, that if Abessalom were alive,   and   all of us dead today, then it would have been right in your sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  007" id="19  007" >7</span>
 And now arise, and go forth, and speak comfortably to your servants; for I have sworn by the Lord, that unless you will go forth today, there shall not a man remain with you this night: and know for yourself, this thing   will   indeed   be   evil to you beyond all the evil that has come upon you from your youth until now.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  008" id="19  008" >8</span>
 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate: and all the people reported, saying, Behold, the king sits in the gate. And all the people went in before the king to the gate; for Israel had fled every man to his  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   tents.  </span>  tent.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  009" id="19  009" >9</span>
 And all the people disputed among all the tribes of Israel, saying, King David delivered us from all our enemies, and he rescued us from the hand of the Philistines: and now he has fled from the land, and from his kingdom, and from Abessalom.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  010" id="19  010" >10</span>
 And Abessalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle: and now why are you° silent about bringing back the king? And the word of all Israel came to the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  011" id="19  011" >11</span>
 And king David sent to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Israel, saying, Why are you° the last to bring back the king to his house? whereas the word of all Israel is come to the king to his house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  012" id="19  012" >12</span>

 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Juda as that of one man; and they sent to the king, saying, Return you, and all your servants.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  015" id="19  015" >15</span>
 And the king returned, and came as far as Jordan. And the men of Juda came to Galgala on their way to meet the king, to cause the king to pass over Jordan.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  016" id="19  016" >16</span>
 And Semei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Baurim, hasted and went down with  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   the man.  </span>  the men of Juda to meet king David.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  017" id="19  017" >17</span>

 and they performed the service of bringing the king over; and there went over a ferry-boat to remove the household of the king, and to do that which was right in his eyes. And Semei the son of Gera fell on his face before the king, as he went over Jordan;  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  019" id="19  019" >19</span>
 and said to the king, Let not my lord now impute iniquity, and remember not all the iniquity of your servant in the day in which my lord went out from Jerusalem, so that the king should mind it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  020" id="19  020" >20</span>
 For your servant knows that I have sinned: and, behold, I am come today before all Israel and the house of Joseph, to go down and meet my lord the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  021" id="19  021" >21</span>
 And Abessai the son of Saruia answered and said, Shall not Semei therefore be put to death, because he cursed the Lord's anointed?  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  022" id="19  022" >22</span>
 And David said, What have I to do with you, you° sons of Saruia, that you° as it were lie in wait against me this day? today no man in Israel shall be put to death, for I know not if I this day reign over Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  023" id="19  023" >23</span>
 And the king said to Semei, You shall not die: and the king swore to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  024" id="19  024" >24</span>
 And Memphibosthe the son of Saul's son went down to meet the king, and had not dressed his feet, nor pared his nails, nor shaved himself, neither had he washed his garments, from the day that the king departed, until the day when he arrived in peace.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  025" id="19  025" >25</span>

 And Memphibosthe said to him, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for your servant said to him, Saddle me the ass, and I will ride upon it, and go with the king; for your servant   is   lame.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  027" id="19  027" >27</span>

 For all the house of my father were but as dead men before my lord the king; yet you have set your servant among them that eat at your table: and what right have I any longer even to cry to the king?  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  029" id="19  029" >29</span>

 And Berzelli said to the king, How many   are   the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  035" id="19  035" >35</span>
 I am this day eighty years old: can I then distinguish between good and evil? Can your servant taste any longer what I eat or drink? can I any longer hear the voice of singing men or singing women? and therefore shall your servant any longer be a burden to my lord the king?  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  036" id="19  036" >36</span>
 Your servant will go  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   as it were a little.  </span>  a little way over Jordan with the king: and why does the king return me this recompense?  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  037" id="19  037" >37</span>
 Let, I pray you, your servant remain, and I will die in my city, by the tomb of my father and of my mother. And, behold, your servant Chamaam shall go over with my lord the king; and do you to him as it seems good in your eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  038" id="19  038" >38</span>
 And the king said, Let Chamaam go over with me, and I will do to him what is good in my sight; and whatever you shall choose at my hand, I will do for you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  039" id="19  039" >39</span>
 And all the people went over Jordan, and the king went over; and the king kissed Berzelli, and blessed him; and he returned to his place.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  040" id="19  040" >40</span>
 And the king went over to Galgala, and Chamaam went over with him: and all the men of Juda went over with the king, and also half the people of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  041" id="19  041" >41</span>
 And behold,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   every man.  </span>  all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brethren the men of Juda stolen you away, and caused the king and all his house to pass over Jordan, and all the men of David with him?  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  042" id="19  042" >42</span>
 And all the men of Juda answered the men of Israel, and said, Because the king is near of kin to us: and why were you thus angry concerning this matter? have we indeed eaten of the king's food? or has he given us a gift, or has he sent us a portion?  <span class="verse" rel="v01019  043" id="19  043" >43</span>
 And the men of Israel answered the men of Juda, and said, We have ten  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   and   Heb. hands.  </span>  parts in the king, and we are older than you, we have also an interest in David above you: and why have you° thus insulted us, and why was not our advice taken before that of Juda, to bring back our king? And the speech of the men of Juda was sharper than the speech of the men of Israel.

<p><span class="chapter" id="20  001">20  </span> And there was a transgressor   so   called there, and his name was Sabee, a Benjamite, the son of Bochori: and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we   any   inheritance in the son of Jessae: to your tents, O Israel, every one.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  002" id="20  002" >2</span>
 And all the men of Israel went up from following David after Sabee the son of Bochori: but the men of Juda adhered to their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  003" id="20  003" >3</span>
 And David went into his house at Jerusalem: and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and he put them in a place of custody, and maintained them, and went not in to them; and they were kept living as widows, till the day of their death.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  004" id="20  004" >4</span>
 And the king said to Amessai, Call to me the men of Juda for three days, and do you be present here.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  005" id="20  005" >5</span>
 And Amessai went to call Juda, and delayed beyond the time which David appointed him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  006" id="20  006" >6</span>
 And David said to Amessai, Now shall Sabee the son of Bochori do us more harm than Abessalom: now then take you with you the servants of your lord, and follow after him, lest he find for himself strong cities, so will he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        i.e.   escape us.  </span>  blind our eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  007" id="20  007" >7</span>
 And there went out after him Amessai and the men of Joab, and the Cherethites, and the Phelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out from Jerusalem to pursue after Sabee the son of Bochori.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  008" id="20  008" >8</span>
 And they   were   by the great stone that is in Gabaon: and Amessai went in before them: and Joab  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   was girded about with.  </span>  had upon him a military cloak over his apparel, and over it he was girded with a dagger fastened upon his loins in its scabbard: and the dagger came out, it even came out and fell.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  009" id="20  009" >9</span>
 And Joab said to Amessai, Are you in health,   my   brother? and the right hand of Joab took hold of the beard of Amessai to kiss him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  010" id="20  010" >10</span>
 And Amessai observed not the dagger that was in the hand of Joab: and Joab struck him with it on the loins, and his  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   belly.  </span>  bowels were shed out upon the ground, and he did not repeat the blow, and he died: and Joab and Abessai his brother pursued after Sabee the son of Bochori.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  011" id="20  011" >11</span>
 And there stood over him one of the servants of Joab, and said, Who   is   he that is for Joab, and who   is   on the side of David following Joab?  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  012" id="20  012" >12</span>
 And Amessai   was   weltering in blood in the midst of the way. And a man saw that all the people stood still; and he removed Amessai out of the path into a field, and he cast a garment upon him, because he saw every one that came to him standing still.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  013" id="20  013" >13</span>
 And when he was quickly removed from the road, every man of Israel passed after Joab to pursue after Sabee the son of Bochori.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  014" id="20  014" >14</span>
 And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Bethmacha; and all in Charri too were assembled, and followed after him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  015" id="20  015" >15</span>
 And they came and besieged him in Abel and Phermacha: and they raised a mound against the city and it stood close to the wall; and all the people with Joab proposed to throw down the wall.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  016" id="20  016" >16</span>
 And a wise woman cried from the wall, and said, Hear, hear; say, I pray you°, to Joab, Draw near hither, and I will speak to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  017" id="20  017" >17</span>
 And he drew near to her, and the woman said to him, Are you Joab? and he said, I   am  . And she said to him, Hear the words of your handmaid; and Joab said, I do hear.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  018" id="20  018" >18</span>
 And she spoke, saying,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   they spoke a word among the first, saying.  </span>  Of old time they said thus, Surely one was asked in Abel, and Dan, whether the faithful in Israel failed in what they purposed; they will surely ask in Abel, even in like manner, whether they have failed.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  019" id="20  019" >19</span>
 I am a peaceful one of the strong ones in Israel; but you seek to destroy a city and a mother city in Israel: why do you seek to ruin the inheritance of the Lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  020" id="20  020" >20</span>
 And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should ruin or destroy.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  021" id="20  021" >21</span>
 Is not the case thus, that a man of mount Ephraim, Sabee, son of Bochori by name, has even lifted up his hand against king David? Give him only to me, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  022" id="20  022" >22</span>
 And the woman went in to all the people, and she spoke to all the city in her wisdom; and  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   it or she.   i.e.   ἡ πόλις.  </span>  they took off the head of Sabee the son of Bochori; and took it away and threw it to Joab: and he blew the trumpet, and the people separated from the city away from him, every man to his tent: and Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  023" id="20  023" >23</span>
 And Joab   was    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   to.  </span>  over all the forces of Israel: and Banaias the son of Jodae   was   over the Cherethites and over the Phelethites.  <span class="verse" rel="v01020  024" id="20  024" >24</span>

 Moreover Iras the   son of   Iarin was priest to David.

<p><span class="chapter" id="21  001">21  </span> And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of the Lord. And the Lord said,   There is    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   iniquity.  </span>  guilt upon Saul and his house because of his  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   the death of his bloods.  </span>  bloody murder, whereby he killed the Gabaonites.  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  002" id="21  002" >2</span>
 And King David called the Gabaonites, and said to them; —(now the Gabaonites are not the children of Israel, but   are   of the remnant of the Amorite, and the children of Israel had sworn to them: but Saul sought to strike them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Juda.)  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  003" id="21  003" >3</span>
 And David said to the Gabaonites, What shall I do to you? and wherewithal shall I make atonement, that you° may bless the inheritance of the Lord?  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  004" id="21  004" >4</span>
 And the Gabaonites said to him, We have no   question about   silver or gold with Saul and with his house; and there is no man for us to put to death in Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  005" id="21  005" >5</span>
 And he said, What say you°? speak, and I will do it for you. And they said to the king, The man who would have made an end of us, and persecuted us, who plotted against us to destroy us, let us utterly destroy him, so that he shall have no standing in all the coasts of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  006" id="21  006" >6</span>
 Let one give us seven men of his sons, and let us hang them up in the sun to the Lord in Gabaon of Saul, as chosen out for the Lord. And the king said, I will give   them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  007" id="21  007" >7</span>
 But the king spared Memphibosthe son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the oath of the Lord that was between them, even between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  008" id="21  008" >8</span>
 And the king took the two sons of Respha the daughter of Aia, whom she bore to Saul, Hermonoi and Memphibosthe, and the five sons of Michol daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Esdriel son of Berzelli the Moulathite.  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  009" id="21  009" >9</span>
 And he gave them into the hand of the Gabaonites, and they hanged them up to the sun in the mountain before the lord: and they fell, even the seven together: moreover they were put to death in the days of harvest at the commencement, in the beginning of barley harvest.  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  010" id="21  010" >10</span>
 And Respha the daughter of Aia took sackcloth, and fixed it for herself on the rock in the beginning of barley harvest, until water dropped upon them out of heaven: and she did not suffer the birds of the air to rest upon them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  011" id="21  011" >11</span>
 And it was told David what Respha the daughter of Aia the concubine of Saul had done,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. omits the words in italics.  </span>    and they were faint, and Dan, the son of Joa of the offspring of the giants overtook them.    <span class="verse" rel="v01021  012" id="21  012" >12</span>
 And David went and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, from the men of the sons of Jabis Galaad, who stole them from the street of Baethsan; for the Philistines set them there in the day in which the Philistines struck Saul in Gelbue.  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  013" id="21  013" >13</span>
 And he carried up thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son, and gathered the bones of them that had been hanged.  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  014" id="21  014" >14</span>
 And they buried the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son, and the bones of them that had been hanged, in the land of Benjamin in the hill, in the sepulchre of Cis his father; and they did all things that the king commanded: and after this God listened to   the prayers of   the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  015" id="21  015" >15</span>
 And there was yet war between the Philistines and Israel: and David went down and his servants with him, and they fought with the Philistines, and David went.  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  016" id="21  016" >16</span>
 And Jesbi, who was of the progeny of Rapha, and the head of whose spear   was   three hundred shekels of brass in weight, who also was girded with a club, even he thought to strike David.  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  017" id="21  017" >17</span>
 And Abessa the son of Saruia helped him and struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore, saying, You shall not any longer go out with us to battle, and you shall not quench the lamp of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  018" id="21  018" >18</span>
 And after this there was a battle again with the Philistines in Geth: then Sebocha the Astatothite killed Seph of the progeny of Rapha.  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  019" id="21  019" >19</span>
 And there was a battle in Rom with the Philistines; and Eleanan son of Ariorgim the Bethleemite killed Goliath the Gittite; and the staff of his spear   was   as a weaver's beam.  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  020" id="21  020" >20</span>
 And there was yet a battle in Geth: and there was  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   The original is Hebrew in Greek letters.  </span>  a man of stature, and the fingers of his hands and the toes of his feet   were   six on each, four and twenty in number: and he also was born to Rapha.  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  021" id="21  021" >21</span>
 And he  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   reproached.  </span>  defied Israel, and Jonathan son of Semei brother of David, struck him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01021  022" id="21  022" >22</span>
 These four were born descendants of the giants in Geth, the family of Rapha; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

 There went up a smoke in his wrath, and fire out of his mouth devours: coals were kindled at it.  <span class="verse" rel="v01022  010" id="22  010" >10</span>

 At the brightness before him coals of fire were kindled.  <span class="verse" rel="v01022  014" id="22  014" >14</span>
 The Lord thundered out of heaven, and the Most High uttered his voice.  <span class="verse" rel="v01022  015" id="22  015" >15</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="23  001">23  </span> And these   are   the last words of David. Faithful   is   David the son of Jessae, and faithful the man whom the Lord raised up to be the anointed of the God of Jacob, and beautiful   are   the psalms of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  002" id="23  002" >2</span>
 The Spirit of the Lord spoke by me, and his word   was   upon my tongue.  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  003" id="23  003" >3</span>
 The God of Israel says, A watchman out of Israel spoke to me a parable: I said among men, How will you° strengthen the fear of the anointed?  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  004" id="23  004" >4</span>
 And in the morning light of God, let the sun arise in the morning, from the light of which the Lord passed on, and as it were from the rain of the tender grass upon the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  005" id="23  005" >5</span>
 For my house   is   not so with the Mighty One: for he has made an everlasting covenant with me, ready, guarded at every time; for all my salvation and all my desire   is  , that the wicked should not flourish.  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  006" id="23  006" >6</span>
 All these   are   as a thorn thrust forth, for they shall not be taken with the hand,  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  007" id="23  007" >7</span>
 and a man shall not labor among them; and   one shall have   that which is fully armed with iron, and the staff of a spear, an he shall burn them with fire, and they shall be burnt in their shame.  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  008" id="23  008" >8</span>
 These   are   the names of the mighty men of David: Jebosthe the Chananite is a captain of the third   part  : Adinon the Asonite, he drew his sword against eight hundred soldiers at once.  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  009" id="23  009" >9</span>
 And after him Eleanan the son of his uncle, son of Dudi who was among the three mighty men with David; and when  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Or,   they defied him among the Philistines.  </span>  he defied the Philistines they were gathered there to war, and the men of Israel went up.  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  010" id="23  010" >10</span>
 He arose an struck the Philistines, until his hand was weary, and his hand clave to the sword: and the Lord wrought a great salvation in that day, and the people  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Heb. returned.  </span>  rested behind him only to strip   the slain  .  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  011" id="23  011" >11</span>
 And after him Samaia the son of Asa the Arachite: and the Philistines were gathered to Theria; and there was there a portion of ground full of lentiles; and the people fled before the Philistines.  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  012" id="23  012" >12</span>
 And he stood firm in the midst of the portion, and rescued it, and struck the Philistines; and the Lord wrought a great deliverance.  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  013" id="23  013" >13</span>
 And three out of the thirty went down, and came to Cason to David, to the cave of Odollam; and   there was   an army of the Philistines, and they encamped in the valley of Raphain.  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  014" id="23  014" >14</span>
 And David   was   then in the strong hold, and the garrison of the Philistines   was   then in Bethleem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  015" id="23  015" >15</span>
 And David longed, and said, Who will give me water to drink out of the well that is in Bethleem by the gate? now the band of the Philistines   was   then in Bethleem.  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  016" id="23  016" >16</span>
 And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well that was in Bethleem in the gate: and they took it, and brought it to David, and he would not drink it, but poured it out before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  017" id="23  017" >17</span>
 And he said, O Lord, forbid that I should do this,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   if.  </span>  that I should drink of the blood of the men who went at   the risk of   their lives: and he would not drink it.

 And Abessa the brother of Joab the son of Saruia, he   was   chief among the three, and he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he killed; and he had a name among three.  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  019" id="23  019" >19</span>
 Of those three   he was   most honorable, and he became a chief over them, but he reached not to the   first   three.  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  020" id="23  020" >20</span>
 And Banaeas the son of Jodae, he was abundant in   mighty   deeds, from Cabeseel, and he struck the two sons of Ariel of Moab: and he went down and struck a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day.  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  021" id="23  021" >21</span>
 He struck an Egyptian,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   a man seen   or   to be seen.  </span>  a wonderful man, and in the hand of the Egyptian   was   a spear as the side of a ladder; and he went down to him with a staff, and snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  022" id="23  022" >22</span>
 These things did Banaeas the son of Jodae, and he had a name among the three mighty men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01023  023" id="23  023" >23</span>
 He was honorable among the   second   three, but he reached not to the   first   three: and David  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   appointed him to his hearings.  </span>  made him his reporter.

<p><span class="chapter" id="24  001">24  </span> And the Lord caused his anger to burn forth again in Israel, and   Satan   stirred up David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  002" id="24  002" >2</span>
 And the king said to Joab commander of the host, who was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel and Juda, from Dan even to Bersabee, and number the people, and I will know the number of the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  003" id="24  003" >3</span>
 And Joab said to the king, Now may the Lord add to the people a hundred-fold as many as they are, and   may   the eyes of my lord the king  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   seeing.  </span>  see it: but why does my lord the king desire this thing?  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  004" id="24  004" >4</span>
 Nevertheless the word of the king prevailed against Joab an the captains of the host: And Joab and the captains of the host went out before the king to number the people of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  005" id="24  005" >5</span>
 And they went over Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right of the city which is in the midst of the valley of Gad and Eliezer.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  006" id="24  006" >6</span>
 And they came to Galaad, and into the land of Thabason, which is Adasai, and they came to Danidan and Udan, and compassed Sidon.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  007" id="24  007" >7</span>
 And they came to Mapsar of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Evite and the Chananite: and they came by the South of Juda to Bersabee.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  008" id="24  008" >8</span>
 And they compassed the whole land; and they arrived at Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  009" id="24  009" >9</span>
 And Joab gave in the number of the census of the people to the king: and Israel consisted of eight hundred thousand men of might that drew sword; and the men of Juda, five hundred thousand fighting men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  010" id="24  010" >10</span>
 And the heart of David struck him after he had numbered the people; and David said to the Lord, I have sinned grievously, O Lord,   in   what I have now done: remove, I pray you, the iniquity of your servant, for I have been exceedingly foolish.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  011" id="24  011" >11</span>
 And David rose early in the morning, and the word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad, the seer, saying, Go, and speak to David, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  012" id="24  012" >12</span>
 Thus says the Lord,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        The word εἰμὶ is simply redundant.  </span>  I bring   one of   three things upon you: now choose you one of them, and I will do   it   to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  013" id="24  013" >13</span>
 And Gad went in to David, and told him, and said to him, Choose   one of these things   to befall you, whether there shall come upon you   for   three years famine in your land; or that you should flee three months before your enemies, and they should pursue you; or that there should be   for   three days mortality in your land. Now then decide, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  014" id="24  014" >14</span>
 And David said to Gad, On every side  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   things are very narrow to me.  </span>  I am much straitened: let me fall now into the hands of the Lord, for his compassions   are   very many; and let me not fall into the hands of man.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  015" id="24  015" >15</span>
 So David chose for himself the mortality: and   they were   the days of wheat harvest; and the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from morning till  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Lit.   dinner time.  </span>  noon, and the plague began among the people; and there died of the people from Dan even to Bersabee seventy thousand men.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  016" id="24  016" >16</span>
 And the angel of the Lord stretched out his hand against Jerusalem to destroy it, and the Lord repented of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people,   It is    <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   much.  </span>  enough now, withhold your hand. And the angel of the Lord was by the threshing floor of Orna the Jebusite.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  017" id="24  017" >17</span>
 And David spoke to the Lord when he saw the angel striking the people, and he said, Behold, it is I that have done wrong,  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Alex.   adds, 'and I the shepherd have done wickedly.'  </span>  but these sheep what have they done? Let your hand, I pray you, be upon me, and upon my father's house.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  018" id="24  018" >18</span>
 And Gad came to David in that day, and said to him, Go up, and set up to the Lord and altar in the threshing floor of Orna the Jebusite.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  019" id="24  019" >19</span>
 And David went up according to the word of Gad, as the Lord commanded him.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  020" id="24  020" >20</span>
 And Orna  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   stooped. See 1 Pet. 1. 12.; also John 20. 5.  </span>  looked out, and saw the king and his servants coming on before him: and Orna went forth, and did obeisance to the king with his face to the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  021" id="24  021" >21</span>
 And Orna said, Why has my lord the king come to his servant? and David said, To buy of you the threshing floor, in order to build an altar to the Lord that the plague may be restrained from off the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  022" id="24  022" >22</span>
 And Orna said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer to the Lord that which is good in his eyes: behold,   here are   oxen for a whole burnt offering, and the wheels and furniture of the oxen for wood.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  023" id="24  023" >23</span>
 Orna gave all to the king: and Orna said to the king, The Lord your God bless you.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  024" id="24  024" >24</span>
 And the king said to Orna, Nay, but I will surely buy it of you at a fair price, and I will not offer to the Lord my God a whole burnt offering for nothing. So David purchased the threshing floor and the oxen for  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Gr.   silver of fifty shekels.  </span>  fifty shekels of silver.  <span class="verse" rel="v01024  025" id="24  025" >25</span>
 And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered up whole burnt offerings and peace-offerings: and Solomon made an addition to the altar afterwards, for it was little at first. And the Lord listened to the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.
