<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">A</span>nd it came to pass when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land: and a man went from Bethleem Juda to sojourn in the land of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 And the man's name   was   Elimelech, and his wife's name Noemin, and the names of his two sons Maalon and Chelaion, Ephrathites of Bethleem of Juda: and they came to the land of Moab, and remained there.  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 And Elimelech the husband of Noemin died; and she was left, and her two sons.  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And they took to themselves wives, women of Moab; the name of the one   was   Orpha, and the name of the second Ruth; and they lived there about ten years.  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 And both Maalon and Chelaion died also; and the woman was left of her husband and her two sons.  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 And she rose up and her two daughters-in-law, and they returned out of the country of Moab, for she heard in the country of Moab that the Lord   had   visited his people to give them bread.  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her: and they went by the way to return to the land of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 And Noemin said to her daughter-in-law, Go now, return each to the house of her mother: the Lord deal mercifully with you, as you° have dealt with the dead, and with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 The Lord grant you that you° may find rest each of you in the house of her husband: and she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 And they said to her, We will return with you to your people.  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 And Noemin said, Return now, my daughters; and why do you° go with me? have I yet sons in my womb to be your husbands?  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 Turn now, my daughters, for I am too old to be married: for I said, Suppose I were married, and should bear sons;  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 would you° wait for them till they should be grown? or would you° refrain from being married for their sakes? Not so, my daughters; for I am grieved for you, that the hand of the Lord has gone forth against me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  014" id="1  014" >14</span>
 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again; and Orpha kissed her mother-in-law and returned to her people; but Ruth followed her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 And Noemin said to Ruth, Behold, your sister-in-law has returned to her people and to her gods; turn now you also after your sister-in-law.  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave you, or to return from following you; for wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you lodge, I will lodge; your people   shall be   my people, and your God my God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 And wherever you die, I will die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also,   if I leave you  , for death   only   shall divide between me and you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 And Noemin seeing that she was determined to go with her, ceased to speak to her any more.  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 And they went both of them until they came to Bethleem: and it came to pass, when they arrived at Bethleem, that all the city rang with them, and they said, Is this Noemin?  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 And she said to them, Nay, do not call me Noemin; call me 'Bitter,' for the Mighty One has dealt very bitterly with me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  021" id="1  021" >21</span>
 I went out full, and the Lord has brought me back empty: and why call you° me Noemin, whereas the Lord has humbled me and the Mighty One has afflicted me?  <span class="verse" rel="v0081  022" id="1  022" >22</span>
 So Noemin and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, returned from the country of Moab; and they came to Bethleem in the beginning of barley harvest.  
<!-- 2   022 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> And Noemin had   a friend   an acquaintance of her husband, and the man   was   a mighty man of the kindred of Elimelech, and his name   was   Booz.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 And Ruth the Moabitess said to Noemin, Let me go now to the field, and I will glean among the ears behind the man with whoever I shall find favor: and she said to her, Go, daughter.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 And she went; and came and gleaned in the field behind the reapers; and she happened by chance to come on a portion of the land of Booz, of the kindred of Elimelech.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 And, behold, Booz came from Bethleem, and said to the reapers, The Lord   be   with you: and they said to him, The Lord bless you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 And Booz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, Whose   is   this damsel?  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 And his servant who was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel who returned with Noemin out of the land of Moab.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the reapers: and she came and stood from morning till evening, and rested not   even   a little in the field.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 And Booz said to Ruth, Hast you not heard,   my   daughter? go not to glean in another field; and depart not you hence, join yourself here with my damsels.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
    Let   your eyes   be   on the field where   my men   shall reap, and you shall go after them: behold, I have charged the young men not to touch you: and when you shall thirst, then you shall go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men shall have drawn.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 And she fell upon her face, and did reverence to the ground, and said to him, How is it that I have found grace in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, whereas I am a stranger?  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  011" id="2  011" >11</span>
 And Booz answered and said to her, It has fully been told me how you have dealt with your mother-in-law after the death of your husband; and how you did leave your father and your mother, and the land of your birth, and came to a people whom you knew not before.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  012" id="2  012" >12</span>
 The Lord recompense your work; may a full reward be given you of the Lord God of Israel, to whom you have come to trust under his wings.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  013" id="2  013" >13</span>
 And she said, Let me find grace in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your handmaid, and behold, I shall be as one of your servants.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  014" id="2  014" >14</span>
 And Booz said to her, Now   it is   time to eat; come here, and you shall eat of the bread, and you shall dip your morsel in the vinegar: and Ruth sat by the side of the reapers: and Booz handed her meal, and she ate, and was satisfied, and left.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  015" id="2  015" >15</span>
 And she rose up to glean; and Booz charged his young men, saying, Let her even glean among the sheaves, and reproach her not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  016" id="2  016" >16</span>
 And do you° by all means carry it for her, and you° shall surely let fall for her some of that which is heaped up; and let her eat, and glean, and rebuke her not.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  017" id="2  017" >17</span>
 So she gleaned in the field till evening, and beat out that she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barely.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  018" id="2  018" >18</span>
 And she took   it   up, and went into the city: and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned, and Ruth brought forth and gave to her the food which she had left from what she had been satisfied with.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  019" id="2  019" >19</span>
 And her mother-in-law said to her, Where have you gleaned today, and where have you wrought? blessed be he that took notice of you. And Ruth told her mother-in-law where she   had   wrought, and said, The name of the man with whom I wrought today   is   Booz.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  020" id="2  020" >20</span>
 And Noemin said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed is he of the Lord, because he has not failed in his mercy with the living and with the dead: and Noemin said to her, The man is near akin to us, he is one of our relations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  021" id="2  021" >21</span>
 And Ruth said to her mother-in-law, Yes, he said also to me, Keep close to my damsels, until the men shall have finished all my reaping.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  022" id="2  022" >22</span>
 And Noemin said to Ruth her daughter-in-law,   It is   well, daughter, that you went out with his damsels; thus they shall not meet you in another field.  <span class="verse" rel="v0082  023" id="2  023" >23</span>
 And Ruth joined herself to the damsels of Booz to glean until they had finished the barley harvest and the wheat harvest.  
<!-- 3   023 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> And she lodged with her mother-in-law: and Noemin her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?  <span class="verse" rel="v0083  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 And now   is   not Booz our kinsman, with whose damsels you were? behold, he winnows barley this night in the floor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0083  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 But do you wash, and anoint yourself, and put your raiment upon you, and go up to the threshing floor: do not discover yourself to the man until he has done eating and drinking.  <span class="verse" rel="v0083  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 And it shall come to pass when he lies down, that you shall mark the place where he lies down, and shall come and lift up the covering of his feet, and shall lie down; and he shall tell you what you shall do.  <span class="verse" rel="v0083  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 And Ruth said to her, All that you shall say, I will do.  <span class="verse" rel="v0083  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 And she went down to the threshing floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law enjoined her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0083  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 And Booz ate and drank, and his heart was glad, and he came to lie down by the side of the heap of corn; and she came secretly, and lifted up the covering of his feet.  <span class="verse" rel="v0083  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 And it came to pass at midnight that the man was amazed, and troubled, and behold, a woman lay at his feet.  <span class="verse" rel="v0083  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 And he said, Who are you? and she said, I am your handmaid Ruth; spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid, for you are a near relation.  <span class="verse" rel="v0083  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 And Booz said, Blessed   be   you of the Lord God,   my   daughter, for you have made your latter kindness greater than the former, in that you follow not after young men, whether   any be   poor or rich.  <span class="verse" rel="v0083  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 And now fear not, my daughter, whatever you shall say I will do to you; for all the tribe of my people knows that you are a virtuous woman.  <span class="verse" rel="v0083  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 And now I am truly akin to you; nevertheless there is a kinsman nearer than I.  <span class="verse" rel="v0083  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 Lodge   here   for the night, and it shall be in the morning, if he will do the part of a kinsman to you, well—let him do it: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, I will do the kinsman's part to you,   as   the Lord lives; lie down till the morning.  <span class="verse" rel="v0083  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 And she lay at his feet until the morning; and she rose up before a man could know his neighbor; and Booz said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.  <span class="verse" rel="v0083  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 And he said to her, Bring the apron that is upon you: and she held it, and he measured six measures of barley, and put them upon her, and she went into the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0083  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 And Ruth went in to her mother-in-law, and she said to her,   My   daughter! and   Ruth   told her all that the man had done to her.  <span class="verse" rel="v0083  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 And she said to her, He gave me these six measures of barley, for he said to me, Go not empty to your mother-in-law.  <span class="verse" rel="v0083  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 And she said, Sit still,   my   daughter, until you shall know how the matter will fall out; for the man will not rest until the matter be accomplished this day.  
<!-- 4   018 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> And Booz went up to the gate, and sat there; and behold, the relative passed by, of whom Booz spoke: and Booz said to him, Turn aside, sit down here, such a one: and he turned aside and sat down.  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 And Booz took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit you° here; and they sat down.  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 And Booz said to the relative,   The matter regards   the portion of the field which was our brother Elimelech's which was given to Noemin, now returning out of the land of Moab;  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 and I said, I will inform you, saying, Buy it before those that sit, and before the elders of my people: if you will redeem it, redeem it, but if you will not redeem it, tell me, and I shall know; for there is no one beside you to do the office of a kinsman, and I am after you: and he said, I am   here  , I will redeem it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  005" id="4  005" >5</span>
 And Booz said, In the day of your buying the field of the hand of Noemin and of Ruth the Moabitess the wife of the deceased, you must also buy her, so as to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 And the kinsman said, I shall not be able to redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance; do you redeem my right for yourself, for I shall not be able to redeem   it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 And this   was   in former time the ordinance in Israel for redemption, and for a bargain, to confirm every word: A man loosed his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor that redeemed his right; and this was a testimony in Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 And the kinsman said to Booz, Buy my right for yourself: and he took off his shoe and gave it to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 And Booz said to the elders and to all the people, You°   are   this day witnesses, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that belonged to Chelaion and Maalon, of the hand of Noemin.  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 Moreover I have bought for myself for a wife Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Maalon, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance; so the name of the dead shall not be destroyed from among his brethren, and from the tribe of his people: you°   are   this day witnesses.  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 And all the people who were in the gate said,   We are   witnesses: and the elders said, The Lord make your wife who goes into your house, as Rachel and as Lia, who both   together   built the house of Israel, and wrought mightily in Ephratha, and there shall be a name   to you   in Bethleem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 And let your house be as the house of Phares, whom Thamar bore to Juda, of the seed which the Lord shall give you of this handmaid.  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 And Booz took Ruth, and she became his wife, and he went in to her; and the Lord gave her conception, and she bore a son.  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  014" id="4  014" >14</span>
 And the woman said to Noemin, Blessed   is   the Lord, who has not suffered a redeemer to fail you this day, even to make your name famous in Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  015" id="4  015" >15</span>
 And he shall be to you a restorer of your soul, and one to cherish your old age; for your daughter-in-law which has loved you, who is better to you than seven sons, has born him.  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  016" id="4  016" >16</span>
 And Noemin took the child and laid it in her bosom, and became a nurse to it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  017" id="4  017" >17</span>
 And the neighbors gave it a name, saying, A son has been born to Noemin; and they called his name Obed; this   is   the father of Jessae the father of David.  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  018" id="4  018" >18</span>
 And these   are   the generations of Phares: Phares begot Esrom:  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  019" id="4  019" >19</span>
 Esrom begot Aram; and Aram begot Aminadab.  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  020" id="4  020" >20</span>
 And Aminadab begot Naasson; and Naasson begot Salmon.  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  021" id="4  021" >21</span>
 And Salmon begot Booz; and Booz begot Obed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0084  022" id="4  022" >22</span>
 And Obed begot Jessae; and Jessae begot David.
