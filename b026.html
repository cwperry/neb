<p><span class="chapter" id="1  001">1  </span><span class="dropcap">N</span>ow it came to pass in the thirties year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, that I was in the midst of the captivity by the river of Chobar; and the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  002" id="1  002" >2</span>
 On the fifth day of the month; this was the fifth year of the captivity of king Joakim.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  003" id="1  003" >3</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to Jezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river of Chobar; and the hand of the Lord was upon me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  004" id="1  004" >4</span>
 And I looked, and, behold, a sweeping wind came from the north, and a great cloud on it, and   there was   brightness round about it, and gleaming fire, and in the midst of it as it were the appearance of amber in the midst of the fire, and brightness in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  005" id="1  005" >5</span>
 And in the midst as it were the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; the likeness of a man was upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  006" id="1  006" >6</span>
 And each one   had   four faces, and each one   had   four wings.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  007" id="1  007" >7</span>
 And their legs were straight; and their feet were winged, and   there were   sparks, like gleaming brass, and their wings were light.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  008" id="1  008" >8</span>
 And the hand of a man was under their wings on their four sides.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  009" id="1  009" >9</span>
 And the faces of them four turned not when they went; they went everyone straight forward.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  010" id="1  010" >10</span>
 And the likeness of their faces was the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right of the four; and the face of a calf on the left of the four; and the face of an eagle to the four.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  011" id="1  011" >11</span>
 And the four had their wings spread out above; each one   had   two joined to one another, and two covered their bodies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  012" id="1  012" >12</span>
 And each one went straight forward: wherever the spirit was going they went, and turned not back.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  013" id="1  013" >13</span>
 And in the midst of the living creatures   there was   an appearance as of burning coals of fire, as an appearance of lamps turning among the living creatures; and the brightness of fire, and out of the fire came forth lightning.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  015" id="1  015" >15</span>
 And I looked, and, behold, the four   had each   one wheel on the ground near the living creatures.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  016" id="1  016" >16</span>
 And the appearance of the wheels was as the appearance of beryl: and the four had one likeness: and their work was as it were a wheel in a wheel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  017" id="1  017" >17</span>
 They went on their four sides: they turned not as they went;  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  018" id="1  018" >18</span>
 neither did their backs   turn  : and they were high: and I [*]saw them, and the backs of them four were full of eyes round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  019" id="1  019" >19</span>
 And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures lifted themselves off the earth, the wheels were lifted off.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  020" id="1  020" >20</span>
 Wherever the cloud happened to be, there was the spirit ready to go: the wheels went and were lifted up with them; because the spirit of life was in the wheels.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  021" id="1  021" >21</span>
 When those went,   the wheels   went; and when those stood,   the wheels   stood; and when those lifted themselves off the earth, they were lifted off with them: for the spirit of life was in the wheels.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  022" id="1  022" >22</span>
 And the likeness over the heads of the living creatures was as a firmament, as the appearance of crystal, spread out over their wings above.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  023" id="1  023" >23</span>
 And their wings were spread out under the firmament, reaching one to the other; two   wings   to each, covering their bodies.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  024" id="1  024" >24</span>
 And I heard the sound of their wings when they went, as the sound of much water: and when they stood, their wings were let down.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  025" id="1  025" >25</span>
 And behold! a voice from above the firmament  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  026" id="1  026" >26</span>
 that was over their head,   there was   as the appearance of a sapphire stone,   and   the likeness of a throne upon it: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as an appearance of a man above.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  027" id="1  027" >27</span>
 And I saw as it were the resemblance of amber from the appearance of the loins and upwards, and from the appearance of the loins and under I saw an appearance of fire, and the brightness thereof round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v0261  028" id="1  028" >28</span>
 As the appearance of the bow when it is in the cloud in days of rain, so was the form of brightness round about.  
<!-- 2   028 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="2  001">2  </span> This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And I saw and fell upon my face, and heard the voice of one speaking: and he said to me, Son of man, stand upon your feet, and I will speak to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0262  002" id="2  002" >2</span>
 And the Spirit came upon me, and took me up, and raised me, and set me on my feet: and I heard him speaking to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0262  003" id="2  003" >3</span>
 And he said to me, Son of Man, I send you forth to the house of Israel, them that provoke me; who have provoked me, they and their fathers to this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v0262  004" id="2  004" >4</span>
 And you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0262  005" id="2  005" >5</span>
 Whether then indeed they shall hear or fear, (for it is a provoking house,) yet they shall know that you are a prophet in the midst of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0262  006" id="2  006" >6</span>
 And you, son of man, fear them not, nor be dismayed at their face; (for they will madden and will rise up against you round about, and you dwell in the midst of scorpions): be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their countenance, for it is a provoking house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0262  007" id="2  007" >7</span>
 And you shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear or fear: for it is a provoking house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0262  008" id="2  008" >8</span>
 And you, son of man, hear him that speaks to you; be not you provoking, as the provoking house: open your mouth, and eat what I give you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0262  009" id="2  009" >9</span>
 And I looked, and behold, a hand stretched out to me, and in it a volume of a book.  <span class="verse" rel="v0262  010" id="2  010" >10</span>
 And he unrolled it before me: and in it the front and the back were written   upon  : and there was written   in it   Lamentation, and mournful song, and woe.  
<!-- 3   010 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="3  001">3  </span> And he said to me, Son of Man, eat this volume, and go and speak to the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  002" id="3  002" >2</span>
 So he opened my mouth, and caused me to eat the volume. And he said to me, Son of man,  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  003" id="3  003" >3</span>
 your mouth shall eat, and your belly shall be filled with this volume that is given to you. So I ate it; and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  004" id="3  004" >4</span>
 And he said to me, Son of man, go your way, and go in to the house of Israel, and speak my words to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  005" id="3  005" >5</span>
 For you are not sent to a people of hard speech,   but   to the house of Israel;  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  006" id="3  006" >6</span>
 neither to many nations of other speech and other tongues, nor of harsh language, whose words you would not understand: although if I   had   sent you to such, they would have listened to you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  007" id="3  007" >7</span>
 But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you; for they will not listen to me: for all the house of Israel are stubborn and hard-hearted.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  008" id="3  008" >8</span>
 And, behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and I will strengthen your power against their power.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  009" id="3  009" >9</span>
 And it shall be continually stronger than a rock: be not afraid of them, neither be dismayed at their faces, because it is a provoking house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  010" id="3  010" >10</span>
 And he said to me, Son of man, receive into your heart all the words that I have spoken to you, and hear   them   with your ears.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  011" id="3  011" >11</span>
 And go your way, go in to the captivity, to the children of your people, and you shall speak to them, and say to them, Thus says the Lord; whether they will hear,   or   whether they will forbear.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  012" id="3  012" >12</span>
 Then the Spirit took me up, and I heard behind me the voice   as   of a great earthquake,   saying  , Blessed   be   the glory of the Lord from his place.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  013" id="3  013" >13</span>
 And I perceived the sound of the wings of the living creatures clapping one to the other, and the sound of the wheels was near them, and the sound of the earthquake.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  014" id="3  014" >14</span>
 And the Spirit lifted me, and took me up, and I went in the impulse of my spirit; and the hand of the Lord was mighty upon me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  015" id="3  015" >15</span>
 Then I passed through the air and came into the captivity, and went round   to   them that lived by the river of Chobar who were there; and I sat there seven days, conversant in the midst of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  016" id="3  016" >16</span>
 And after the seven days the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man,  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  017" id="3  017" >17</span>
 I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel; and you shall hear a word of my mouth, and shall threaten them from me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  018" id="3  018" >18</span>
 When I say to the wicked, You shall surely die; and you have not warned him, to give warning to the wicked, to turn from his ways, that he should live; that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  019" id="3  019" >19</span>
 But if you warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, and from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, and you shall deliver your soul.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  020" id="3  020" >20</span>
 And when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits a trespass, and I shall bring punishment before him, he shall die, because you did not warn him: he shall even die in his sins, because his righteousness shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at your hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  021" id="3  021" >21</span>
 But if you warn the righteous not to sin, and he sin not, the righteous shall surely live, because you have warned him; and you shall deliver your own soul.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  022" id="3  022" >22</span>
 And the hand of the Lord came upon me; and he said to me, Arise, and go forth into the plain, and there shall you be spoken to.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  023" id="3  023" >23</span>
 And I arose, and went forth to the plain: and, behold, the glory of the Lord stood there, according to the vision, and according to the glory of the Lord, which I saw by the river of Chobar: and I fell on my face.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  024" id="3  024" >24</span>
 Then the Spirit came upon me, and set me on my feet, and spoke to me, and said to me, Go in, and shut yourself up in the midst of your house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  025" id="3  025" >25</span>
 And you, son of man, behold, bonds are prepared for you, and they shall bind you with them, and you shall not come forth of the midst of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  026" id="3  026" >26</span>
 Also I will bind your tongue, and you shall be dumb, and shall not be to them a reprover: because it is a provoking house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0263  027" id="3  027" >27</span>
 But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord, He that hears, let him hear; and he that is disobedient, let him be disobedient: because it is a provoking house.  
<!-- 4   027 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="4  001">4  </span> And you, son of man, take you a brick, and you shall set it before your face, and shall portray on it the city,   even   Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v0264  002" id="4  002" >2</span>
 And you shall besiege it, and build works against it, and throw up a mound round about it, and pitch camps against it, and set up engines round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v0264  003" id="4  003" >3</span>
 And take you to yourself an iron pan, and you shall set it   for   an iron wall between you and the city: and you shall set your face against it, and it shall be in a siege, and you shall besiege it. This is a sign to the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0264  004" id="4  004" >4</span>
 And you shall lie upon your left side, and lay the iniquities of the house of Israel upon it, according to the number of the hundred and fifty days   during   which you shall lie upon it: and you shall bear their iniquities.  <span class="verse" rel="v0264  005" id="4  005" >5</span>
 For I have appointed you their iniquities for a number of days, for a hundred and ninety days: so you shall bear the iniquities of the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v0264  006" id="4  006" >6</span>
 And you shall accomplish this, and   then   shall lie on your right side, and shall bear the iniquities of the house of Juda forty days: I have appointed you a day for a year.  <span class="verse" rel="v0264  007" id="4  007" >7</span>
 So you shall set your face to the siege of Jerusalem, and shall strengthen your arm, and shall prophesy against it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0264  008" id="4  008" >8</span>
 And, behold, I have prepared bonds for you, land you may not turn from your one side to the other, until the days of your siege shall be accomplished.  <span class="verse" rel="v0264  009" id="4  009" >9</span>
 Take you also to you wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and bread-corn; and you shall cast them into one earthen vessel, and shall make them into loaves for yourself; and you shall eat them a hundred and ninety days, according to the number of the days   during   which you sleep on your side.  <span class="verse" rel="v0264  010" id="4  010" >10</span>
 And you shall eat your food by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shall you eat them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0264  011" id="4  011" >11</span>
 And you shall drink water by measure, even from time to time you shall drink the sixth part of a hin.  <span class="verse" rel="v0264  012" id="4  012" >12</span>
 And you shall eat them   as   a barley cake: you shall bake them before their eyes in man's dung.  <span class="verse" rel="v0264  013" id="4  013" >13</span>
 And you shall say, Thus says the Lord God of Israel; Thus shall the children of Israel eat unclean things among the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" rel="v0264  014" id="4  014" >14</span>
 Then I said, Not so, Lord God of Israel: surely my soul has not been defiled with uncleanness; nor have I eaten, that which died of itself or was torn of beasts from my birth until now; neither has any corrupt flesh entered into my mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0264  015" id="4  015" >15</span>
 And he said to me, Behold, I have given you dung of oxen instead of man's dung, and you shall prepare your loaves upon it.  <span class="verse" rel="v0264  016" id="4  016" >16</span>
 And he said to me, Son of man, behold, I break the support of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight and in lack; and shall drink water by measure, and in a state of ruin:  <span class="verse" rel="v0264  017" id="4  017" >17</span>
 that they may lack bread and water; and a man and his brother shall be brought to ruin, and they shall pine away in their iniquities.

<p><span class="chapter" id="5  001">5  </span> And you, son of man, take you a sword sharper than a barber's razor; you shall procure it for yourself, and shall bring it upon your head, and upon your beard: and you shall take a pair of scales, and shall separate the hair.  <span class="verse" rel="v0265  002" id="5  002" >2</span>
 A fourth part you shall burn in the fire in the midst of the city, at the fulfillment of the days of the siege: and you shall take a fourth part, and burn it up in the midst of it: and a fourth part you shall cut with a sword round about it: and a fourth part you shall scatter to the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0265  003" id="5  003" >3</span>
 And you shall take thence a few in number, and shall wrap them in the fold of your garment.  <span class="verse" rel="v0265  004" id="5  004" >4</span>
 And you shall take of these again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them up with fire: from thence shall come forth fire; and you shall say to the whole house of Israel,  <span class="verse" rel="v0265  005" id="5  005" >5</span>
 Thus says the Lord; This is Jerusalem: I have set her and the countries round about her in the midst of the nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0265  006" id="5  006" >6</span>
 And you shall declare my ordinances to the lawless one from out of the nations; and my statutes   to the sinful one   of the countries round about her: because they have rejected my ordinances, and have not walked in my statutes.  <span class="verse" rel="v0265  007" id="5  007" >7</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord, Because your occasion   for sin has been taken   from the nations round about you, and you° have not walked in my statutes, nor kept my ordinances, nay, you° have not even done according to the ordinances of the nations round about you; therefore thus says the Lord;  <span class="verse" rel="v0265  008" id="5  008" >8</span>
 Behold, I am against you, and I will execute judgment in the midst of you in the sight of the nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0265  009" id="5  009" >9</span>
 And I will do in you things which I have not done, and the like of which I will not do again, for all your abominations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0265  010" id="5  010" >10</span>
 Therefore the fathers shall eat   their   children in the midst of you, and children shall eat   their   fathers; and I will execute judgments in you, and I will scatter all that are left of you to every wind.  <span class="verse" rel="v0265  011" id="5  011" >11</span>
 Therefore,   as   I live, says the Lord; surely, because you have defiled my holy things with all your abominations, I also will reject you; my eye shall not spare, and I will have no mercy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0265  012" id="5  012" >12</span>
 A fourth part of you shall be cut off by pestilence, and a fourth part of you shall be consumed in the midst of you with famine: and   as for another   fourth part of you, I will scatter them to every wind; and a fourth part of you shall fall by sword round about you, and I will draw out a sword after them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0265  013" id="5  013" >13</span>
 And my wrath and my anger shall be accomplished upon them: and you shall know that I the Lord have spoken in my jealousy, when I have accomplished my anger upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0265  014" id="5  014" >14</span>
 And I will make you desolate, and your daughters round about you, in the sight of every one that passes through.  <span class="verse" rel="v0265  015" id="5  015" >15</span>
 And you shall be mourned over and miserable among the nations round about you, when I have executed judgments in you in the vengeance of my wrath. I the Lord have spoken.  <span class="verse" rel="v0265  016" id="5  016" >16</span>
 And when I have sent against them shafts of famine, then they shall be consumed, and I will break the strength of your bread.  <span class="verse" rel="v0265  017" id="5  017" >17</span>
 So I will send forth against you famine and evil beasts, and I will take vengeance upon you; and pestilence and blood shall pass through upon you; and I will bring a sword upon you round about. I the Lord have spoken.

<p><span class="chapter" id="6  001">6  </span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v0266  002" id="6  002" >2</span>
 Son of man, set your face against the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them;  <span class="verse" rel="v0266  003" id="6  003" >3</span>
 and you shall say, You° mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord; thus says the Lord to the mountains, and to the hills, and to the valleys, and to the forests; Behold, I bring a sword upon you, and your high places shall be utterly destroyed.  <span class="verse" rel="v0266  004" id="6  004" >4</span>
 And your altars shall be broken to pieces, and your consecrated plats; and I will cast down your slain   men   before your idols.  <span class="verse" rel="v0266  005" id="6  005" >5</span>
 And I will scatter your bones round about your altars,  <span class="verse" rel="v0266  006" id="6  006" >6</span>
 and in all your habitations: the cities shall be made desolate, and the high places utterly laid waste; that your altars may be destroyed, and your idols be broken to pieces, and your consecrated plats be abolished.  <span class="verse" rel="v0266  007" id="6  007" >7</span>
 And slain   men   shall fall in the midst of you, and you° shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0266  008" id="6  008" >8</span>
 When there are   some   of you escaping from the sword among the Gentiles, and when you° are scattered in the countries;  <span class="verse" rel="v0266  009" id="6  009" >9</span>
 then they of you that escape among the nations whither they were carried captive shall remember me; (I have sworn   an oath   against their heart that goes a-whoring from me, and their eyes that go a-whoring after their practices;) and they shall mourn over themselves for all their abominations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0266  010" id="6  010" >10</span>
 And they shall know that I the Lord have spoken.  <span class="verse" rel="v0266  011" id="6  011" >11</span>
 Thus says the Lord; Clap with   your   hand, and stamp with   your   foot and say, Aha, aha! for all the abominations of the house of Israel: they shall fall by the sword, and by pestilence, and by famine.  <span class="verse" rel="v0266  012" id="6  012" >12</span>
 He that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that is far off shall die by the pestilence; and he that is in the siege shall be consumed with famine: and I will accomplish my anger upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0266  013" id="6  013" >13</span>
 Then you° shall know that I am the Lord, when your slain are in the midst of your idols round about your altars, on every high hill, and under   every   shady tree, where they offered a sweet savor to all their idols.  <span class="verse" rel="v0266  014" id="6  014" >14</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="7  001">7  </span> Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Also, you, son of man, say,  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  002" id="7  002" >2</span>
 Thus says the Lord; An end is come to the land of Israel, the end is come on the four corners of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  003" id="7  003" >3</span>
 The end is come on you,  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  004" id="7  004" >4</span>
 the inhabitant of the land: the time is come, the day has drawn near, not with tumult, nor with pangs.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  005" id="7  005" >5</span>
 Now I will pour out my anger upon you near at hand, and I will accomplish my wrath on you: and I will judge you for your ways, and recompense upon you all your abominations.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  006" id="7  006" >6</span>
 Mine eye shall not spare, nor will I have any mercy: for I will recompense your ways upon you, and your abominations shall be in the midst of you; and you shall know that I am the Lord that strike   you  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  007" id="7  007" >7</span>
 Now the end   is come   to you, and I will send   judgment   upon you: and I will take vengeance on your ways, and will recompense all your abominations upon you.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  008" id="7  008" >8</span>
 Mine eye shall not spare, nor will I have any mercy: for I will recompense your way upon you, and your abominations shall be in the midst of you; and you shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  009" id="7  009" >9</span>
 For thus says the Lord; Behold, the end is come.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  010" id="7  010" >10</span>
 Behold, the day of the Lord! although the rod has blossomed,  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  011" id="7  011" >11</span>
 pride has sprung up, and will break the staff of the wicked one, and   that   not with tumult, nor with haste.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  012" id="7  012" >12</span>
 The time is come, behold the day: let not the buyer rejoice, and let not the seller mourn.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  013" id="7  013" >13</span>
 For the buyer shall never again return to the seller, neither shall a man cleave with the eye   of hope   to his life.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  014" id="7  014" >14</span>
 Sound you° the trumpet, and pass sentence on all together.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  015" id="7  015" >15</span>
    There shall be   war with the sword without, and famine and pestilence within: he that is in the field shall die by the sword; and famine and pestilence shall destroy them that are in the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  016" id="7  016" >16</span>
 But they that escape of them shall be delivered, and shall be upon the mountains: and I will kill all   the rest  , every one for his iniquities.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  017" id="7  017" >17</span>
 All hands shall be completely weakened, and all thighs shall be defiled with moisture.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  018" id="7  018" >18</span>
 And they shall gird themselves with sackcloth, and amazement shall cover them; and shame shall be upon them,   even   upon every face, and baldness upon every head.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  019" id="7  019" >19</span>
 Their silver shall be cast forth in the streets, and their gold shall be despised: their souls shall not be satisfied, and their bellies shall not be filled: for it was the punishment of their iniquities.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  020" id="7  020" >20</span>
    As for   their choice ornaments, they employed them for pride, and they made of them images of their abominations: therefore have I made them uncleanness to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  021" id="7  021" >21</span>
 And I will deliver them into the hands of strangers to make them a prey, and to the pests of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  022" id="7  022" >22</span>

 And they shall work uncleanness: because the land is full of strange nations, and the city is full of iniquity.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  024" id="7  024" >24</span>
 And I will turn back the boasting of their strength; and their holy things shall be defiled.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  025" id="7  025" >25</span>
 And   though   propitiation shall come, and   one   shall seek peace, yet there shall be none.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  026" id="7  026" >26</span>
 There shall be woe upon woe, and there shall be message upon message; and a vision shall be sought from a prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.  <span class="verse" rel="v0267  027" id="7  027" >27</span>
 The prince shall clothe himself with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be made feeble: I will do to them according to their ways, and according to their judgments will I punish them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.

<p><span class="chapter" id="8  001">8  </span> And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the fifth month, on the fifth   day   of the month, I was sitting in the house, and the elders of Juda were sitting before me: and the hand of the Lord came upon me.  <span class="verse" rel="v0268  002" id="8  002" >2</span>
 And I looked, and, behold, the likeness of a man: from his loins and downwards   there was   fire, and from his loins upwards   there was   as the appearance of amber.  <span class="verse" rel="v0268  003" id="8  003" >3</span>
 And he stretched forth the likeness of a hand, and took me by the crown of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and sky, and brought me to Jerusalem in a vision of God, to the porch of the gate that looks to the north, where was the pillar of the Purchaser.  <span class="verse" rel="v0268  004" id="8  004" >4</span>
 And, behold, the glory of the Lord God of Israel was there, according to the vision which I saw in the plain.  <span class="verse" rel="v0268  005" id="8  005" >5</span>
 And he said to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and, behold,   I looked   from the north toward the eastern gate.  <span class="verse" rel="v0268  006" id="8  006" >6</span>
 And he said to me, Son of man, have you seen what these do? They commit great abominations here so that I should keep away from my sanctuary: and you shall see yet greater iniquities.  <span class="verse" rel="v0268  007" id="8  007" >7</span>
 And he brought me to the porch of the court.  <span class="verse" rel="v0268  008" id="8  008" >8</span>
 And he said to me, Son of man, dig: so I dug, and behold a door.  <span class="verse" rel="v0268  009" id="8  009" >9</span>
 And he said to me, Go in, and behold the iniquities which they practise here.  <span class="verse" rel="v0268  010" id="8  010" >10</span>
 So I went in and looked; and [*]saw vain abominations, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon them round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v0268  011" id="8  011" >11</span>
 And seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and Jechonias the son of Saphan stood in their presence in the midst of them, and each one held his censer in his hand; and the smoke of the incense went up.  <span class="verse" rel="v0268  012" id="8  012" >12</span>
 And he said to me, You have seen, son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel do, each one of them in their secret chamber: because they have said, The Lord see not; The Lord has forsaken the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v0268  013" id="8  013" >13</span>
 And he said to me, You shall see yet greater iniquities which these do.  <span class="verse" rel="v0268  014" id="8  014" >14</span>
 And he brought me in to the porch of the house of the Lord that looks to the north; and, behold   there were   women sitting there lamenting for Thammuz.  <span class="verse" rel="v0268  015" id="8  015" >15</span>
 And he said to me, Son of man, you have seen; but you shall yet see   evil   practices greater then these.  <span class="verse" rel="v0268  016" id="8  016" >16</span>
 And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the Lord, and at the entrance of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty men, with their back parts toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces   turned   the opposite way; and these were worshipping the sun.  <span class="verse" rel="v0268  017" id="8  017" >17</span>
 And he said to me, Son of man, you have seen this.   Is it   a little thing to the house of Juda to practise the iniquities which they have practised here? for they have filled the land with iniquity: and, behold, these are as scorners.  <span class="verse" rel="v0268  018" id="8  018" >18</span>
 Therefore will I deal with them in wrath: my eye shall not spare, nor will I have any mercy.

<p><span class="chapter" id="9  001">9  </span> And he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, The judgment of the city has drawn near; and each had the weapons of destruction in his hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v0269  002" id="9  002" >2</span>
 And, behold, six men came from the way of the high gate that looks toward the north, and each one's axe was in his hand; and there was one man in the midst of them clothed with a long robe down to the feet, and a sapphire girdle was on his loins: and they came in and stood near the brazen altar.  <span class="verse" rel="v0269  003" id="9  003" >3</span>
 And the glory of the God of Israel, that was upon them, went up from the cherubs to the porch of the house. And he called the man that was clothed with the long robe, who had the girdle on his loins;  <span class="verse" rel="v0269  004" id="9  004" >4</span>
 And said to him, Go through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that groan and that grieve for all the iniquities that are done in the midst of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v0269  005" id="9  005" >5</span>
 And he said to the first in my hearing, Go after him into the city, and strike: and let not your eyes spare, and have no mercy.  <span class="verse" rel="v0269  006" id="9  006" >6</span>
 Slay utterly old man and youth, and virgin, and infants, and women: but go you° not near any on whom is the mark: begin at my sanctuary. So they began with the elder men who were within in the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v0269  007" id="9  007" >7</span>
 And he said to them, Defile the house, and go out and fill the ways with dead bodies, and strike.  <span class="verse" rel="v0269  008" id="9  008" >8</span>
 And it came to pass as they were striking, that I fell upon my face, and cried out, and said, Alas, O Lord! will you destroy the remnant of Israel, in pouring out your wrath upon Jerusalem?  <span class="verse" rel="v0269  009" id="9  009" >9</span>
 Then said he to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Juda is become very exceedingly great: for the land is filled with many nations, and the city is filled with iniquity and uncleanness: because they have said, The Lord has forsaken the earth, The Lord looks not upon   it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v0269  010" id="9  010" >10</span>
 Therefore my eye shall not spare, neither will I have any mercy: I have recompensed their ways upon their heads.  <span class="verse" rel="v0269  011" id="9  011" >11</span>
 And, behold, the man clothed with the long robe, and girded with the girdle about his loins, answered and said, I have done as you did command me.

<p><span class="chapter" id="10  001">10  </span> Then I looked, and, behold, over the firmament that was above the head of the cherubs   there was   a likeness of a throne over them, as a sapphire stone.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  002" id="10  002" >2</span>
 And he said to the man clothed with the   long   robe, Go in between the wheels that are under the cherubs, and fill your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubs, and scatter   them   over the city. And he went in my sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  003" id="10  003" >3</span>
 And the cherubs stood on the right hand of the house, as the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  004" id="10  004" >4</span>
 Then the glory of the Lord departed from the cherubs to the porch of the house; and the cloud filled the house, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  005" id="10  005" >5</span>
 And the sound of the cherubs' wings was heard as far as the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God speaking.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  006" id="10  006" >6</span>
 And it came to pass, when he gave a charge to the man clothed with the sacred robe, saying, Take fire from between the wheels from between the cherubs, that he went in, and stood near the wheels.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  007" id="10  007" >7</span>
 And he stretched forth his hand into the midst of the fire that was between the cherubs, and took   thereof  , and put   it   into the hands of the man clothed with the sacred robe: and he took   it  , and went out.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  008" id="10  008" >8</span>
 And I saw the cherubs   having   the likeness of men's hands under their wings.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  009" id="10  009" >9</span>
 And I saw, and behold, four wheels stood by the cherubs, one wheel by each cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the appearance of a carbuncle stone.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  010" id="10  010" >10</span>
 And   as for   their appearance,   there was   one likeness to the four, as if there should be a wheel in the midst of a wheel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  011" id="10  011" >11</span>
 When they went, they went on their four sides; they turned not when they went, for whichever way the first head looked, they went; and they turned not as they went.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  012" id="10  012" >12</span>
 And their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about the four wheels.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  013" id="10  013" >13</span>
 And these wheels were called Gelgel in my hearing.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  015" id="10  015" >15</span>
 And the cherubs were the same living creature which I saw by the river of Chobar.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  016" id="10  016" >16</span>
 And when the cherubs went, the wheels went, and they were close to them: and when the cherubs lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, their wheels turned not.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  017" id="10  017" >17</span>
 When they stood,   the wheels   stood; and when they mounted up,   the wheels   mounted up with them: because the spirit of life was in them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  018" id="10  018" >18</span>
 Then the glory of the Lord departed from the house, and went up on the cherubs.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  019" id="10  019" >19</span>
 And the cherubs lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went forth, the wheels were also beside them, and they stood at the entrance of the front gate of the house of the Lord; and the glory of the God of Israel was upon them above.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  020" id="10  020" >20</span>
 This is the living creature which I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chobar; and I knew that they were cherubs.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  021" id="10  021" >21</span>
 Each one   had   four faces, and each one   had   eight wings; and under their wings was the likeness of men's hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v02610  022" id="10  022" >22</span>
 And   as for   the likeness of their faces, these are the   same   faces which I saw under the glory of the God of Israel by the river of Chobar: and they went each straight forward.

<p><span class="chapter" id="11  001">11  </span> Moreover the Spirit took me up, and brought me to the front gate of the house of the Lord, that looks eastward: and behold at the entrance of the gate were about five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Jechonias the son of Ezer, and Phaltias the son of Banaeas, the leaders of the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  002" id="11  002" >2</span>
 And the Lord said to me, Son of man, these are the men that devise vanities, and take evil counsel in this city:  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  003" id="11  003" >3</span>
 who say, Have not the houses been newly built? This is the caldron, and we are the flesh.  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  004" id="11  004" >4</span>
 Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man.  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  005" id="11  005" >5</span>
 And the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said to me, say; Thus says the Lord; Thus have you° said, O house of Israel: and I know the devices of your spirit.  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  006" id="11  006" >6</span>
 You° have multiplied your dead in this city, and you° have filled your ways with slain men.  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  007" id="11  007" >7</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord; Your dead whom you° have struck in the midst of it, these are the flesh, and this  city   is the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  008" id="11  008" >8</span>
 You° fear the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  009" id="11  009" >9</span>
 And I will bring you forth out of the midst of it, and will deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  010" id="11  010" >10</span>

 And it came to pass, while I was prophesying, that Phaltias the son of Banaeas died. And I fell upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Alas, alas, O Lord! will you utterly destroy the remnant of Israel?  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  014" id="11  014" >14</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  015" id="11  015" >15</span>
 Son of man, your brethren, and the men of your captivity, and all the house of Israel are come to the full, to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem said, Keep you° far away from the Lord: the land is given to us for an inheritance.  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  016" id="11  016" >16</span>
 Therefore say you, Thus says the Lord; I will cast them off among the nations, and will disperse them into every land, yet will I be to them for a little sanctuary in the countries which they shall enter.  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  017" id="11  017" >17</span>
 Therefore say you, Thus says the Lord; I will also take them from the heathen, and gather them out of the lands wherein I have scattered them, and will give them the land of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  018" id="11  018" >18</span>
 And they shall enter in there, and shall remove all the abominations of it, and all its iniquities from it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  019" id="11  019" >19</span>
 And I will give them another heart, and will put a new spirit within them; and will extract the heart of stone from their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh:  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  020" id="11  020" >20</span>
 that they may walk in my commandments, and keep my ordinances, and do them: and they shall be to me a people, and I will be to them a God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  021" id="11  021" >21</span>
 And as for the heart   set upon   their abominations and their iniquities, as their heart went   after them  , I have recompensed their ways on their heads, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  022" id="11  022" >22</span>
 Then the cherubs lifted up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  023" id="11  023" >23</span>
 And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood on the mountain which was in front of the city.  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  024" id="11  024" >24</span>
 And the Spirit took me up, and brought me to the land of the Chaldeans, to the captivity, in a vision by the Spirit of God: and I went up after the vision which I saw.  <span class="verse" rel="v02611  025" id="11  025" >25</span>
 And I spoke to the captivity all the words of the Lord which he had showed me.

<p><span class="chapter" id="12  001">12  </span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  002" id="12  002" >2</span>
 Son of man, you dwell in the midst of the iniquities of those, who have eyes to see, and see not; and have ears to hear, and hear not: because it is a provoking house.  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  003" id="12  003" >3</span>
 You therefore, son of man, prepare yourself baggage for going into captivity by day in their sight; and you shall be led into captivity from your place into another place in their sight; that they may see that it is a provoking house.  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  004" id="12  004" >4</span>
 And you shall carry forth your baggage, baggage for captivity, by day before their eyes: and you shall go forth at even, as a captive goes forth, in their sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  005" id="12  005" >5</span>
 Dig for yourself into the wall   of the house  , and you shall pass through it in their sight:  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  006" id="12  006" >6</span>
 you shall be lifted up on   men's   shoulders, and shall go forth in secret: you shall cover your face, and shall not see the ground: because I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  007" id="12  007" >7</span>
 And I did thus according to all that he commanded me; and I carried forth my baggage for captivity by day, and in the evening I dug through the wall for myself, and went out secretly; I was taken up on   men's   shoulders before them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  008" id="12  008" >8</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me in the morning, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  009" id="12  009" >9</span>
 Son of man, have not the house of Israel, the provoking house, said to you, What do you?  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  010" id="12  010" >10</span>
 Say to them, Thus says the Lord God, the Prince and the Ruler in Israel, even to all the house of Israel who are in the midst of them:  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  011" id="12  011" >11</span>
 say, I am performing signs: as I have done, so shall it be to him: they shall go into banishment and captivity.  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  012" id="12  012" >12</span>
 And the prince in the midst of them shall be borne upon shoulders, and shall go forth in secret through the wall, and shall dig so that he may go forth thereby: he shall cover his face, that he may not be seen by   any   eye, and he himself shall not see the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  013" id="12  013" >13</span>
 And I will spread out my net upon him, and he shall be caught in my toils: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; but he shall not see it, though he shall die there.  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  014" id="12  014" >14</span>
 And I will scatter to every wind all his assistants round about him, and all that help him; and I will draw out a sword after them;  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  015" id="12  015" >15</span>
 And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have scattered them among the nations; and I will disperse them in the countries.  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  016" id="12  016" >16</span>
 And I will leave of them   a few   men in number   spared   from the sword, and from famine, and pestilence; that they may declare all their iniquities among the nations whither they have gone; and they shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  017" id="12  017" >17</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  018" id="12  018" >18</span>
 Son of man, eat your bread with sorrow, and drink   your   water with torment and affliction.  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  019" id="12  019" >19</span>
 And you shall say to the people of the land, Thus says the Lord to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, on the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread in scarcity, and shall drink their water in desolation, that the land may be desolate with all that it contains: for all that dwell in it are ungodly.  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  020" id="12  020" >20</span>
 And their inhabited cities shall be laid utterly waste, and the land shall be desolate; and you° shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  021" id="12  021" >21</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  022" id="12  022" >22</span>
 Son of man, what is your parable on the land of Israel, that you° say, The days are long, the vision has perished?  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  023" id="12  023" >23</span>
 Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord; I will even set aside this parable, and the house of Israel shall no more at all use this parable: for you shall say to them, The days are at hand, and the import of every vision.  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  024" id="12  024" >24</span>
 For there shall no more be any false vision, nor any one prophesying flatteries in the midst of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  025" id="12  025" >25</span>
 For I the Lord will speak my words; I will speak and perform   them  , and will no more delay, for in your days, O provoking house, I will speak the word, and will perform   it  , says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  026" id="12  026" >26</span>
 Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  027" id="12  027" >27</span>
 Son of man, behold, the provoking house of Israel boldly say, The vision which this man sees is for many days, and he prophesies for times afar off.  <span class="verse" rel="v02612  028" id="12  028" >28</span>
 Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord; Henceforth none of my words shall linger, which I shall speak: I will speak and do, says the Lord.

<p><span class="chapter" id="13  001">13  </span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  002" id="13  002" >2</span>
 Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel, and you shall prophesy, and shall say to them, Hear you° the word of the Lord:  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  003" id="13  003" >3</span>
 Thus says the Lord, Woe to them that prophesy out of their own heart, and who see nothing at all.  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  004" id="13  004" >4</span>
 Your prophets, O Israel, are like foxes in the deserts.  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  005" id="13  005" >5</span>
 They have not continued steadfast, and they have gathered flocks against the house of Israel, they that say,  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  006" id="13  006" >6</span>
 In the day of the Lord, have not stood, seeing false   visions  , prophesying vanities, who say, The Lord says, and the Lord has not sent them, and they began   to try   to confirm the word.  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  007" id="13  007" >7</span>
 Have you° not seen a false vision? and spoken vain prophecies?  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  008" id="13  008" >8</span>
 And therefore say, Thus says the Lord; Because your words are false, and your prophecies are vain, therefore, behold, I am against you, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  009" id="13  009" >9</span>
 And I will stretch forth my hand against the prophets that see false   visions  , and those that utter vanities: they shall not partake of the instruction of my people, neither shall they be written in the roll of the house of Israel, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel; and they shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  010" id="13  010" >10</span>
 Because they have caused my people to err, saying, Peace; and there is no peace; and one builds a wall, and they plaster it, —it shall fall.  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  011" id="13  011" >11</span>
 Say to them that plaster   it  , It shall fall; and there shall be a flooding rain; and I will send great stones upon their joinings, and they shall fall; and there shall be a sweeping wind, and it shall be broken.  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  012" id="13  012" >12</span>
 And behold! the wall has fallen; and will they not say to you, Where is your plaster wherewith you° plastered   it  ?  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  013" id="13  013" >13</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord; I will even cause to burst forth a sweeping blast with fury, and there shall be a flooding rain in my wrath; and in   my   fury I will bring on great stones for complete destruction.  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  014" id="13  014" >14</span>
 And I will break down the wall which you° have plastered, and it shall fall; and I will lay it on the ground, and its foundations shall be discovered, and it shall fall; and you° shall be consumed with rebukes: and you° shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  015" id="13  015" >15</span>
 And I will accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that plaster it; it shall fall: and I said to you, The wall is not, nor they that plaster it,  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  016" id="13  016" >16</span>
 even the prophets of Israel, who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see   visions of   peace for her, and there is no peace, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  017" id="13  017" >17</span>
 And you, son of man, set your face firmly against the daughters of your people, that prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy against them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  018" id="13  018" >18</span>
 And you shall say, Thus says the Lord, Woe to the   women   that sew pillows under every elbow, and make kerchiefs on the head of every stature to pervert souls! The souls of my people are perverted, and they have saved souls alive.  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  019" id="13  019" >19</span>
 And they have dishonored me before my people for a handful of barley, and for pieces of bread, to kill the souls which should not die, and to save alive the souls which should not live, while you° speak to a people hearing vain speeches.  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  020" id="13  020" >20</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord God, Behold, I am against your pillows, whereby you° there confound souls, and I will tear them away from your arms, and will set at liberty their souls which you° pervert to scatter them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  021" id="13  021" >21</span>
 And I will tear your kerchiefs, and will rescue my people out of your hands, and they shall no longer be in your hands to be confounded; and you° shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  022" id="13  022" >22</span>
 Because you° have perverted the heart of the righteous, whereas I perverted him not, and   that   in order to strengthen the hands of the wicked, that he should not at all turn from his evil way and live:  <span class="verse" rel="v02613  023" id="13  023" >23</span>
 therefore you° shall not see false   visions  , and you° shall no more utter prophecies: but I will deliver my people out of your hand; and you° shall know that I am the Lord.

<p><span class="chapter" id="14  001">14  </span> And there came to me men of the people of Israel, of the elders, and sat before me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  002" id="14  002" >2</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  003" id="14  003" >3</span>
 Son of man, these men have conceived their devices in their hearts, and have set before their faces the punishment of their iniquities: shall I indeed answer them?  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  004" id="14  004" >4</span>
 Therefore speak to them, and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord; Any man of the house of Israel, who shall conceive his devices in his heart, and shall set the punishment of his iniquity before his face, and shall come to the prophet; I the Lord will answer him   according to the things   in which his mind is entangled,  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  005" id="14  005" >5</span>
 that he should turn aside the house of Israel, according to their hearts that are estranged from me in their thoughts.  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  006" id="14  006" >6</span>
 Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God, Be converted, and turn from your   evil   practices, and from all your sins, and turn your faces back again.  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  007" id="14  007" >7</span>
 For any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, who shall separate himself from me, and conceive his imaginations in his heart, and set before his face the punishment of his iniquity, and come to the prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the Lord will answer him,   according to the things   wherein he is entangled.  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  008" id="14  008" >8</span>
 And I will set my face against that man, and will make him desolate and ruined, and will cut him off from the midst of my people; and you° shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  009" id="14  009" >9</span>
 And if a prophet should cause to err and should speak, I the Lord have caused that prophet to err, and will stretch out my hand upon him, and will utterly destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  010" id="14  010" >10</span>
 And they shall bear their iniquity according to the trespass of him that asks; and it shall be in like manner to the prophet according to the trespass:  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  011" id="14  011" >11</span>
 that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, and that they may no more defile themselves with any of their transgressions: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  012" id="14  012" >12</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  013" id="14  013" >13</span>
 Son of man, if a land shall sin against me by committing a trespass, then will I stretch out my hand upon it, and will break its staff of bread, and will send forth famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast.  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  014" id="14  014" >14</span>
 And though these three men should be in the midst of it, Noe, and Daniel, and Job, they   alone   should be delivered by their righteousness, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  015" id="14  015" >15</span>
 If again I bring evil beasts upon the land, and take vengeance upon it, and it be ruined, and there be no one to pass through for fear of the wild beasts:  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  016" id="14  016" >16</span>
 and   if   these three men should be in the midst of it,   as   I live, says the Lord, neither sons nor daughters shall be saved, but these only shall be saved, and the land shall be destroyed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  017" id="14  017" >17</span>
 Or again if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Let the sword go through the land; and I cut off from them man and beast:  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  018" id="14  018" >18</span>
 though these three men were in the midst of it, as I live, says the Lord, they shall not deliver sons or daughters, but they only shall be saved themselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  019" id="14  019" >19</span>
 Or   if   again I send pestilence upon that land, and pour out my wrath upon it in blood, to destroy from off it man and beast:  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  020" id="14  020" >20</span>
 and should Noe, and Daniel, and Job, be in the midst of it,   as   I live, says the Lord, there shall be left   them   neither sons nor daughters;   only   they by their righteousness shall deliver their souls.  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  021" id="14  021" >21</span>
 Thus says the Lord, And if I even send upon Jerusalem my four sore judgments, sword, and famine, and evil beasts, and pestilence, to destroy from out of it man and beast;  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  022" id="14  022" >22</span>
 yet, behold,   there shall be   men left in it, the escaped thereof, who   shall   lead forth of it sons and daughters: behold, they   shall   go forth to you, and you° shall see their ways and their thoughts: and you° shall mourn over the evils which I have brought upon Jerusalem,   even   all the evils which I have brought upon it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02614  023" id="14  023" >23</span>

 Will they take wood of it to make   it fit   for work? will they take of it a peg to hang any vessel upon it?  <span class="verse" rel="v02615  004" id="15  004" >4</span>
 It is only given to the fire to be consumed; the fire consumes that which is yearly pruned of it, and it is utterly gone. Will it be useful for   any   work?  <span class="verse" rel="v02615  005" id="15  005" >5</span>
 Not even while it is yet whole will it be   useful   for   any   work: if the fire shall have utterly consumed it, will it still be   fit   for work?  <span class="verse" rel="v02615  006" id="15  006" >6</span>
 Therefore say, Thus says the Lord, As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given up to the fire to be consumed, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v02615  007" id="15  007" >7</span>
 And I will set my face against them; they shall go forth of the fire, and   yet   fire shall devour them; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have set my face against them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02615  008" id="15  008" >8</span>
 And I will give up the land to ruin, because they have utterly transgressed, says the Lord.

<p><span class="chapter" id="16  001">16  </span> Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  002" id="16  002" >2</span>
 Son of man, testify to Jerusalem   of   her iniquities;  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  003" id="16  003" >3</span>
 and you shall say, Thus says the Lord to Jerusalem; Your root and your birth are of the land of Chanaan: your father was an Amorite, and your mother a Chettite.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  004" id="16  004" >4</span>
 And   as for   your birth in the day wherein you were born, you did not bind your breasts, and you were not washed in water, neither was you salted with salt, neither was you swathed in swaddling-bands.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  005" id="16  005" >5</span>
 Nor did my eye pity you, to do for you one of all these things, to feel at all for you; but you were cast out on the face of the field, because of the deformity of your person, in the day wherein you were born.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  006" id="16  006" >6</span>
 And I passed by to you, and saw you polluted in your blood; and I said to you,   Let there be   life out of your blood:  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  007" id="16  007" >7</span>
 increase; I have made you as the springing grass of the field. So you did increase and grow, and did enter into great cities: your breasts were set, and your hair grew, whereas you were naked and bare.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  008" id="16  008" >8</span>
 And I passed by you and saw you, and, behold,   it was   your time and a time of resting; and I spread my wings over you, and covered your shame, and swear to you: and I entered into covenant with you, says the Lord, and you became mine.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  009" id="16  009" >9</span>
 And I washed you in water, and washed your blood from you, and anointed you with oil.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  010" id="16  010" >10</span>
 And I clothed you with embroidered   garments  , and clothed you beneath with purple, and girded you with fine linen, and clothed you with silk,  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  011" id="16  011" >11</span>
 and decked you also with ornaments, and put bracelets on your hands, and a necklace on your neck.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  012" id="16  012" >12</span>
 And I put a pendant on your nostril, and rings in your ears, and a crown of glory on your head.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  013" id="16  013" >13</span>
 So you were adorned with gold and silver; and your raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and variegated work: you did eat fine flour, and oil, and honey, and did become extremely beautiful.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  014" id="16  014" >14</span>
 And your name went forth among the nations for your beauty: because it was perfected with elegance,   and   in the comeliness which I put upon you, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  015" id="16  015" >15</span>
 You did trust in your beauty, and did go a-whoring because of your renown, and did pour out your fornication on every passer by.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  016" id="16  016" >16</span>
 And you did take of your garments, and made to yourself idols of needlework, and did go a-whoring after them; therefore you shall never come in, nor shall   the like   take place.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  017" id="16  017" >17</span>
 And you took your fair ornaments of my gold and of my silver, of what I gave you, and you made to yourself male images, and you did commit whoredom with them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  018" id="16  018" >18</span>
 And you did take your variegated apparel and did clothe them, and you did set before them my oil and my incense.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  019" id="16  019" >19</span>
 And   you took   my bread which I gave you, (  yes   I fed you with fine flour and oil and honey) and did set them before them for a sweet smelling savor: yes, it was so, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  020" id="16  020" >20</span>
 And you took your sons and your daughters, whom you bore, and did sacrifice   these   to them to be destroyed. You did go a-whoring as   if that were   little,  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  021" id="16  021" >21</span>
 and did kill your children, and gave them up in offering them to them for an expiation.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  022" id="16  022" >22</span>
 This is beyond all your fornication, and you did not remember your infancy, when you were naked and bare,   and   did live   though   defiled in your blood.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  023" id="16  023" >23</span>
 And it came to pass after all your wickedness, says the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  024" id="16  024" >24</span>
 that you did build yourself a house of fornication, and did make yourself a public place in every street;  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  025" id="16  025" >25</span>
 and on the head of every way you did set up your fornications, and did defile your beauty, and did open your feet to every passer by, and did multiply your fornication.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  026" id="16  026" >26</span>
 And you did go a-whoring after the children of Egypt your neighbors, great of flesh; and did go a-whoring, often to provoke me to anger.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  027" id="16  027" >27</span>
 And if I stretch out my hand against you, then will I abolish your statutes, and deliver   you   up to the wills of them that hate you,   even to   the daughters of the Philistines that turned you aside from the way wherein you sinned.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  028" id="16  028" >28</span>
 And you did go a-whoring to the daughters of Assur, and not even thus was you satisfied; yes, you did go a-whoring, and was not satisfied.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  029" id="16  029" >29</span>
 And you did multiply your covenants with the land of the Chaldeans; and not even with these was you satisfied.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  030" id="16  030" >30</span>
 Why should I make a covenant with your daughter, says the Lord, while you do all these things, the works of a harlot? and you have gone a-whoring in a threefold degree with your daughters.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  031" id="16  031" >31</span>
 You have built a house of harlotry in every top of a way, and have set up your high place in every street; and you did become as a harlot gathering hires.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  032" id="16  032" >32</span>
 An adulteress resembles you, taking rewards of her husband.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  033" id="16  033" >33</span>
 She has even given rewards to all that went a-whoring after her, and you have given rewards to all your lovers, yes, you did load them with rewards, that they should come to you from every side for your fornication.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  034" id="16  034" >34</span>
 And there has happened in you perverseness in your fornication beyond   other   women, and they have committed fornication with you, in that you give hires over and above, and hires were not given to you; and   thus   perverseness happened in you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  035" id="16  035" >35</span>
 Therefore, harlot, hear the word of the Lord:  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  036" id="16  036" >36</span>
 Thus says the Lord, Because you have poured forth your money, therefore your shame shall be discovered in your harlotry with your lovers, and   with   regard to all the imaginations of your iniquities, and for the blood of your children which you have given to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  037" id="16  037" >37</span>
 Therefore, behold, I   will   gather all your lovers with whom you have consorted, and all whom you have loved, with all whom you did hate; and I will gather them against you round about, and will expose your wickedness to them, and they shall see all your shame.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  038" id="16  038" >38</span>
 And I will be avenged on you with the vengeance of an adulteress, and I will bring upon you blood of fury and jealousy.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  039" id="16  039" >39</span>
 And I will deliver you into their hands, and they shall break down your house of harlotry, and destroy your high place; and they shall strip you of your garments, and shall take your proud ornaments, and leave you naked and bare.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  040" id="16  040" >40</span>
 And they shall bring multitudes upon you, and they shall stone you with stones, and pierce you with their swords.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  041" id="16  041" >41</span>
 And they shall burn your houses with fire, and shall execute vengeance on you in the sight of many women: and I will turn you back from harlotry, and I will no more give   you   rewards.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  042" id="16  042" >42</span>
 So will I slacken my fury against you, and my jealousy shall be removed from you, and I will rest, and be no more careful   for you  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  043" id="16  043" >43</span>
 Because you did not remember your infancy, and you did grieve me in all these things; therefore, behold, I have recompensed your ways upon your head, says the Lord: for thus have you wrought ungodliness above all your   other   iniquities.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  044" id="16  044" >44</span>
 These are all the things they have spoken against you in a proverb, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  045" id="16  045" >45</span>
 As is the mother, so is your mother's daughter: you are she that has rejected her husband and her children; and the sisters of your sisters have rejected their husbands and their children: your mother was a Chettite, and   your   father an Amorite.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  046" id="16  046" >46</span>
 Your elder sister who dwells on your left hand is Samaria, she and her daughters: and your younger sister, that dwells on the right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  047" id="16  047" >47</span>
 Yet notwithstanding you have not walked in their ways, neither have you done according to their iniquities within a little, but you have exceeded them in all your ways.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  048" id="16  048" >48</span>
    As   I live, says the Lord, this Sodom and her daughters have not done as you and your daughters have done.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  049" id="16  049" >49</span>
 Moreover this was the sin of your sister Sodom, pride: she and her daughters lived in pleasure, in fullness of bread   and   in abundance: this belonged to her and her daughters, and they helped not the hand of the poor and needy.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  050" id="16  050" >50</span>
 And they boasted, and wrought iniquities before me: so I cut them off as I saw   fit  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  051" id="16  051" >51</span>
 Also Samaria has not sinned according to half of your sins; but you have multiplied your iniquities beyond them, and you have justified your sisters in all your iniquities which you have committed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  052" id="16  052" >52</span>
 You therefore bear your punishment, for that you have corrupted your sisters by your sins which you have committed beyond them; and you have made them   appear   more righteous than yourself: you therefore be ashamed, and bear your dishonor, in that you have justified your sisters.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  053" id="16  053" >53</span>
 And I will turn their captivity,   even   the captivity of Sodom and her daughters; and I will turn the captivity of Samaria and her daughters; and I will turn your captivity in the midst of them:  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  054" id="16  054" >54</span>
 that you may bear your punishment, and be dishonored for all that you have done in provoking me to anger.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  055" id="16  055" >55</span>
 And your sister Sodom and her daughters shall be restored as they were at the beginning, and you and your daughters shall be restored as you° were at the beginning.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  056" id="16  056" >56</span>
 And surely your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the days of your pride:  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  057" id="16  057" >57</span>
 before your wickedness was discovered, even now you are the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all that are round about her,   even   of the daughters of the Philistines that compass you round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  058" id="16  058" >58</span>
    As for   your ungodliness and your iniquities, you have borne them, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  059" id="16  059" >59</span>
 Thus says the Lord; I will even do to you as you have done, as you have dealt shamefully in these things to transgress my covenant.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  060" id="16  060" >60</span>
 And I will remember my covenant   made   with you in the days of your infancy, and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  061" id="16  061" >61</span>
 Then you shall remember your way, and shall be utterly dishonored when you receive your elder sisters with your younger ones: and I will give them to you for building up, but not by your covenant.  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  062" id="16  062" >62</span>
 And I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall know that I am the Lord:  <span class="verse" rel="v02616  063" id="16  063" >63</span>
 that you may remember, and be ashamed, and may no more be able to open your mouth for your shame, when I am reconciled to you for all that you have done, says the Lord.

<p><span class="chapter" id="17  001">17  </span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  002" id="17  002" >2</span>
 Son of man, relate a tale, and speak a parable to the house of Israel:  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  003" id="17  003" >3</span>
 and you shall say, Thus says the Lord; A great eagle with large wings, spreading them out very far, with many claws, which has the design of entering into Libanus—and he took the choice   branches   of the cedar:  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  004" id="17  004" >4</span>
 he cropped off the ends of the tender twigs, and brought them into the land of Chanaan; he laid them up in a walled city.  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  005" id="17  005" >5</span>
 And he took of the seed of the land, and sowed it in a field planted by much water; he set it in a conspicuous place.  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  006" id="17  006" >6</span>
 And it sprang up, and became a weak and little vine, so that the branches thereof appeared   upon   it, and its roots were under it: and it became a vine, and put forth shoots, and sent forth its tendrils.  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  007" id="17  007" >7</span>
 And there was another great eagle, with great wings and many claws: and, behold, this vine bent itself round toward him, and her roots   were turned   towards him, and she sent forth her branches towards him, that   he   might water her together with the growth of her plantation.  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  008" id="17  008" >8</span>
 She thrives in a fair field by much water, to produce shoots and bear fruit, that she might become a great vine.  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  009" id="17  009" >9</span>
 Therefore say, Thus says the Lord; Shall it prosper? shall not the roots of her tender stem and her fruit be blighted? yes, all her early shoots shall be dried up, and   that   not by a mighty arm, nor by many people, to tear her up from her roots.  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  010" id="17  010" >10</span>
 And, behold, it thrives: shall it prosper? shall it not wither as soon as the east wind touches it? it shall be withered together with the growth of its shoots.  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  011" id="17  011" >11</span>
 Moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  012" id="17  012" >12</span>
 Son of man, say now to the provoking house, Know you° not what these things were? say   to them  , Whenever the king of Babylon shall come against Jerusalem, then he shall take her king and her princes, and shall take them home to Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  013" id="17  013" >13</span>
 And he shall take of the seed royal, and shall make a covenant with him, and shall bind him with an oath: and he shall take the princes of the land:  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  014" id="17  014" >14</span>
 that it may become a weak kingdom, so as never to lift itself up, that he may keep his covenant, and establish it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  015" id="17  015" >15</span>
 And   if   he shall revolt from him, to send his messengers into Egypt, that   they   may give him horses and much people; shall he prosper? shall he that acts as an adversary be preserved? and shall he that transgresses the covenant be preserved?  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  016" id="17  016" >16</span>
    As   I live, says the Lord, verily in   the   place where the king is that made him king, who dishonored my oath, and who broke my covenant, shall he die with him in the midst of Babylon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  017" id="17  017" >17</span>
 And Pharaoh shall make war upon him not with a large force or great multitude, in throwing up a mound, and in building of forts, to cut off souls.  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  018" id="17  018" >18</span>
 Whereas he has profaned the oath so as to break the covenant, when, behold, I engage his hand, and he has done all these things to him, he shall not escape.  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  019" id="17  019" >19</span>
 Therefore say, Thus says the Lord;   As   I live, surely my oath which he has profaned, and my covenant which he has transgressed, I will even recompense it upon his head.  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  020" id="17  020" >20</span>
 And I will spread a net upon him, and he shall be caught in its snare.  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  021" id="17  021" >21</span>
 In every battle of his they shall fall by the sword, and I will scatter   his   remnant to every wind: and you° shall know that I the Lord have spoken it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  022" id="17  022" >22</span>
 For thus says the Lord; I will even take of the choice   branches   of the cedar from the top   thereof  , I will crop off their hearts, and I will plant it on a high mountain:  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  023" id="17  023" >23</span>
 and I will hang it on a lofty mountain of Israel: yes, I will plant it, and it shall put forth shoots, and shall bear fruit, and it shall be a great cedar: and every bird shall rest beneath it, even every fowl shall rest under its shadow: its branches shall be restored.  <span class="verse" rel="v02617  024" id="17  024" >24</span>
 And all the trees of the field shall know that I am the Lord that bring low the high tree, and exalt the low tree, and wither the green tree, and cause the dry tree to flourish: I the Lord have spoken, and will do   it  .

<p><span class="chapter" id="18  001">18  </span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  002" id="18  002" >2</span>
 Son of man, what mean you° by this parable among the children of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten unripe grapes, and the children's teeth have been set on edge?  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  003" id="18  003" >3</span>
    As   I live, says the Lord, surely this parable shall no more be spoken in Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  004" id="18  004" >4</span>
 For all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son, they are mine: the soul that sins, it shall die.  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  005" id="18  005" >5</span>
 But the man who shall be just, who executes judgment and righteousness,  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  006" id="18  006" >6</span>
 who shall not eat upon the mountains, and shall not at all lift up his eyes to the devices of the house of Israel, and shall not defile his neighbor's wife, and shall not draw near to her that is removed,  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  007" id="18  007" >7</span>
 and shall not oppress any man,   but   shall return the pledge of the debtor, and shall be guilty of no plunder, shall give his bread to the hungry, and clothe the naked;  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  008" id="18  008" >8</span>
 and shall not lend his money upon usury, and shall not receive usurious increase, and shall turn back his hand from injustice, shall execute righteous judgment between a man and his neighbor,  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  009" id="18  009" >9</span>
 and has walked in my commandments and kept my ordinances, to do them; he is righteous, he shall surely live, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  010" id="18  010" >10</span>
 And if he beget a mischievous son, shedding blood and committing sins,  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  011" id="18  011" >11</span>
 who has not walked in the way of his righteous father, but has even eaten upon the mountains, and has defiled his neighbor's wife,  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  012" id="18  012" >12</span>
 and has oppressed the poor and needy, and has committed robbery, and not restored a pledge, and has set his eyes upon idols, has wrought iniquities,  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  013" id="18  013" >13</span>
 has lent upon usury, and taken usurious increase; he shall by no means live: he has wrought all these iniquities; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  014" id="18  014" >14</span>
 And if he beget a son, and   the son   see all his father's sins which he has wrought, and fear, and not do according to them,  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  015" id="18  015" >15</span>
 and   if he   has not eaten on the mountains, and has not set his eyes on the devices of the house of Israel, and has not defiled his neighbor's wife,  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  016" id="18  016" >16</span>
 and has not oppressed a man, and has not retained the pledge, nor committed robbery, has given his bread to the hungry, and has clothed the naked,  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  017" id="18  017" >17</span>
 and has turned back his hand from unrighteousness, has not received interest or usurious increase, has wrought righteousness, and walked in my ordinances; he shall not die for the iniquities of his father, he shall surely live.  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  018" id="18  018" >18</span>
 But if his father grievously afflict, or plunder, he has wrought enmity in the midst of my people, and shall die in his iniquity.  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  019" id="18  019" >19</span>
 But you° will say, Why has not the son borne the iniquity of the father? Because the son has wrought judgment and mercy, has kept all my statues, and done them, he shall surely live.  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  020" id="18  020" >20</span>
 But the soul that sins shall die: and the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, nor shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the iniquity of the transgressor shall be upon him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  021" id="18  021" >21</span>
 And if the transgressor turn away from all his iniquities which he has committed, and keep all my commandments, and do justice and mercy, he shall surely live, and shall by no means die.  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  022" id="18  022" >22</span>
 None of his trespasses which he has committed shall be remembers: in his righteousness which he has done he shall live.  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  023" id="18  023" >23</span>
 Shall I at all desire death of the sinner, says the Lord, as I   desire   that he should turn from   his   evil way, and live?  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  024" id="18  024" >24</span>
 But when the righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, according to all the transgressions which the transgressor has wrought, none of his righteousness which he has wrought shall be at all remembered: in his trespass wherein he has trespassed, and in his sins wherein he has sinned, in them shall he die.  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  025" id="18  025" >25</span>
 Yet you° have said, The way of the Lord is not straight. Hear now, all the house of Israel; will not my way be straight? Is your way straight?  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  026" id="18  026" >26</span>
 When the righteous turns away from his righteousness and commits a trespass, and dies in the trespass he has committed, he shall   even   die in it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  027" id="18  027" >27</span>
 And when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and shall do judgment and justice, he has kept his soul,  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  028" id="18  028" >28</span>
 and has turned away from all his ungodliness which he has committed: he shall surely live, he shall not die.  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  029" id="18  029" >29</span>
 Yet the house of Israel say, The way of the Lord is not right. Is not my way right, O house of Israel? is not your way wrong?  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  030" id="18  030" >30</span>
 I will judge you, O house of Israel, says the Lord, each one according to his way: be converted, and turn from all your ungodliness, and it shall not become to you the punishment of iniquity.  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  031" id="18  031" >31</span>
 Cast away from yourselves all your ungodliness wherein you° have sinned against me; and make to yourselves a new heart and a new spirit: for why should you° die, O house of Israel?  <span class="verse" rel="v02618  032" id="18  032" >32</span>
 For I desire not the death of him that dies, says the Lord.

<p><span class="chapter" id="19  001">19  </span> Moreover do you take up a lamentation for the prince of Israel,  <span class="verse" rel="v02619  002" id="19  002" >2</span>

 And one of her whelps sprang forth; he became a lion, and learned to take prey, he devoured men.  <span class="verse" rel="v02619  004" id="19  004" >4</span>
 And the nations heard a report of him; he was caught in their pit, and they brought him into the land of Egypt in chains.  <span class="verse" rel="v02619  005" id="19  005" >5</span>
 And she saw that he was driven away from her,   and   her hope   of him   perished, and she took another of her whelps; she made him a lion.  <span class="verse" rel="v02619  006" id="19  006" >6</span>
 And he went up and down in the midst of lions, he became a lion, and learned to take prey, he devoured men.  <span class="verse" rel="v02619  007" id="19  007" >7</span>

 Then the nations set upon him from the countries round about, and they spread their nets upon him: he was taken in their pit.  <span class="verse" rel="v02619  009" id="19  009" >9</span>
 And they put him in chains and in a cage,   and   he came to the king of Babylon; and he cast him into prison, that his voice should not be heard on the mountains of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02619  010" id="19  010" >10</span>

 But she was broken down in wrath, she was cast upon the ground, and the east wind dried up her choice   branches  : vengeance came upon them, and the rod of her strength was withered; fire consumed it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02619  013" id="19  013" >13</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="20  001">20  </span> And it came to pass in the seventh year, on the fifteenth day of the month, there came men of the elders of the house of Israel to enquire of the Lord, and they sat before me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  002" id="20  002" >2</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  003" id="20  003" >3</span>
 Son of man, speak to the elders of the house of Israel, and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord; Are you° come to enquire of me?   As   I live, I will not be enquired of by you, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  004" id="20  004" >4</span>
 Shall I utterly take vengeance on them, son of man? testify to them of the iniquities of their fathers:  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  005" id="20  005" >5</span>
 and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord; From the day that I chose the house of Israel, and became known to the seed of the house of Jacob, and was known to them in the land of Egypt, and helped them with my hand, saying, I am the Lord your God;  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  006" id="20  006" >6</span>
 in that day I helped them with my hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into the land which I prepared for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, it is abundant beyond every land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  007" id="20  007" >7</span>
 And I said to them, Let every one cast away the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the devices of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  008" id="20  008" >8</span>
 But they revolted from me, and would not listen to me: they cast not away the abominations of their eyes, and forsook not the devices of Egypt: then I said that I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my wrath upon them in the midst of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  009" id="20  009" >9</span>
 But I wrought   so   that my name should not be at all profaned in the sight of the Gentiles, in the midst of whom they are, among whom I was made known to them in their sight, to bring them out of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  010" id="20  010" >10</span>
 And I brought them into the wilderness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  011" id="20  011" >11</span>
 And I gave them my commandments, and made known to them my ordinances, all which   if   a man shall do, he shall even live in them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  012" id="20  012" >12</span>
 And I gave them my sabbaths, that they should be for a sign between me and them, that they should know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  013" id="20  013" >13</span>
 And I said to the house of Israel in the wilderness, Walk you° in my commandments: but they walked not   in them  , and they rejected my ordinances, which   if   a man shall do, he shall even live in them; and they grievously profaned my sabbaths: and I said that I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  014" id="20  014" >14</span>
 But I wrought   so   that my name should not be at all profaned before the Gentiles, before whose eyes I brought them out.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  015" id="20  015" >15</span>
 But I lifted up my hand against them in the wilderness once for all, that I would not bring them into the land which I gave them, a land flowing with milk and honey, it is sweeter than all lands:  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  016" id="20  016" >16</span>
 because they rejected my ordinances, and walked not in my commandments, but profaned my sabbaths, and went after the imaginations of their hearts.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  017" id="20  017" >17</span>
 Yet my eyes spared them, so as   not   to destroy them utterly, and I did not make an end of them in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  018" id="20  018" >18</span>
 And I said to their children in the wilderness, Walk not you° in the customs of your fathers, and keep not their ordinances, and have no fellowship with their practices, nor defile yourselves   with them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  019" id="20  019" >19</span>
 I   am   the Lord your God; walk in my commandments, and keep my ordinances, and do them;  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  020" id="20  020" >20</span>
 and hallow my sabbaths, and let them be a sign between me and you, that you° may know that I am the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  021" id="20  021" >21</span>
 But they provoked me, and their children walked not in my commandments, and they took no heed to my ordinances to do them, which   if   a man shall do, he shall even live in them, and they profaned my sabbaths: then I said that I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to accomplish my anger upon them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  022" id="20  022" >22</span>
 But I wrought so that my name might not be at all profaned before the Gentiles; and I brought them out in their sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  023" id="20  023" >23</span>
 I lifted up my hand against them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the Gentiles,   and   disperse them in the countries;  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  024" id="20  024" >24</span>
 because they kept not my ordinances, and rejected my commandments, and profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes went after the imaginations of their fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  025" id="20  025" >25</span>
 So I gave them commandments   that were   not good, and ordinances in which they should not live.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  026" id="20  026" >26</span>
 And I will defile them by their   own   decrees, when I pass through upon every one that opens the womb, that I may destroy them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  027" id="20  027" >27</span>
 Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord: Hitherto have your fathers provoked me in their trespasses in which they transgressed against me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  028" id="20  028" >28</span>
 Whereas I brought them into the land concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it them; and they looked upon every high hill, and every shady tree, and they sacrificed there to their gods, and offered there sweet smelling savor, and there they poured out their drink-offerings.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  029" id="20  029" >29</span>
 And I said to them, What is Abama, that you° go in there? and they called its name Abama, until this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  030" id="20  030" >30</span>
 Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord, Do you° pollute yourselves with the iniquities of your fathers, and do you° go a-whoring after their abominations,  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  031" id="20  031" >31</span>
 and   do you° pollute yourselves   with the first fruits of your gifts, in the offerings wherewith you° pollute yourselves in all your imaginations, until this day; and shall I answer you, O house of Israel?   As   I live, says the Lord, I will not answer you, neither shall this thing come upon your spirit.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  032" id="20  032" >32</span>
 And it shall not be as you° say, We will be as the nations, and as the tribes of the earth, to worship stocks and stones.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  033" id="20  033" >33</span>
 Therefore,   as   I live, says the Lord, I will reign over you with a strong hand, and with a high arm, and with outpoured wrath:  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  034" id="20  034" >34</span>
 I will bring you out from the nations, and will take you out of the lands wherein you° were dispersed, with a strong hand, and with a high arm, and with outpoured wrath.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  035" id="20  035" >35</span>
 And I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations, and will plead with you there face to face.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  036" id="20  036" >36</span>
 As I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I judge you, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  037" id="20  037" >37</span>
 And I will cause you to pass under my rod, and I will bring you in by number.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  038" id="20  038" >38</span>
 And I will separate from among you the ungodly and the revolters; for I will lead them forth out of their place of sojourning, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and you° shall know that I am the Lord,   even   the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  039" id="20  039" >39</span>
 And   as to   you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord,   even   the Lord; Put away each one his   evil   practices, and hereafter if you° listen to me, then shall you° no more profane my holy name by your gifts and by devices.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  040" id="20  040" >40</span>
 For upon my holy mountain, on the high mountain, says the Lord,   even   the Lord, there shall all the house of Israel serve me for ever: and there will I accept   you  , and there will I have respect to your first fruits, and the first fruits of your offerings, in all your holy things.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  041" id="20  041" >41</span>
 I will accept you with a sweet smelling savor, when I bring you out from the nations, and take you out of the countries wherein you° have been dispersed; and I will be sanctified among you in the sight of the nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  042" id="20  042" >42</span>
 And you° shall know that I am the Lord, when I have brought you into the land of Israel, into the land concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  043" id="20  043" >43</span>
 And you° shall there remember your ways, and your devices wherewith you° defiled yourselves; and you° shall bewail yourselves for all your wickedness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  044" id="20  044" >44</span>
 And you° shall know that I am the Lord, when I have done thus to you, that my name may not be profaned in your evil ways, and in your corrupt devices, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  045" id="20  045" >45</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  046" id="20  046" >46</span>
 Son of man, set your face against Thaeman, and look toward Darom, and prophesy against the chief forest of Nageb,  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  047" id="20  047" >47</span>
 and you shall say to the forest of Nageb, Hear the word of the Lord; thus says the Lord,   even   the Lord; Behold, I   will   kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour in you every green tree, and every dry tree: the flame that is kindled shall not be quenched, and every face shall be scorched with it from the south to the north.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  048" id="20  048" >48</span>
 And all flesh shall know that I the Lord have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.  <span class="verse" rel="v02620  049" id="20  049" >49</span>
 And I said, Not so, O Lord God! they say to me, Is not this that is spoken a parable?  
<!-- 21   049 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="21  001">21  </span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  002" id="21  002" >2</span>
 Therefore prophesy, son of man, set your face steadfastly toward Jerusalem, and look toward their holy places, and you shall prophesy against the land of Israel,  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  003" id="21  003" >3</span>
 and you shall say to the land of Israel, Thus says the Lord; Behold, I am against you, and I will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and I will destroy out of you the transgressor and unrighteous.  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  004" id="21  004" >4</span>
 Because I will destroy out of you the unrighteous and the transgressor,   therefore   so shall my sword come forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  005" id="21  005" >5</span>
 and all flesh shall know that I the Lord have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath: it shall not return any more.  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  006" id="21  006" >6</span>
 And you, son of man, groan with the breaking of your loins; you shall even groan heavily in their sight.  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  007" id="21  007" >7</span>
 And it shall come to pass, if they shall say to you, Therefore do you groan? that you shall say, For the report; because it comes: and every heart shall break, and all hands shall become feeble, and all flesh and every spirit shall faint, and all thighs shall be defiled with moisture: behold, it comes, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  008" id="21  008" >8</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  009" id="21  009" >9</span>
 Son of man, prophesy, and you shall say, Thus says the Lord; Say, Sword, sword, be sharpened and rage,  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  010" id="21  010" >10</span>
 that you may kill victims; be sharpened that you may be bright, ready for slaughter, kill, set at nothing, despise every tree.  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  011" id="21  011" >11</span>
 And he made it ready for his hand to hold: the sword is sharpened, it is ready to put into the hand of the slayer.  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  012" id="21  012" >12</span>
 Cry out and howl, son of man: for this   sword   is come upon my people, this   sword is come   upon all the princes of Israel: they shall be as strangers:   judgment   with the sword is come upon my people: therefore clap your hands, for sentence has been passed:  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  013" id="21  013" >13</span>
 and what if even the tribe be rejected? it shall not be, says the Lord God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  014" id="21  014" >14</span>
 And you, son of man, prophesy, and clap your hands, and take a second sword: the third sword is   the sword   of the slain, the great sword of the slain: and you shall strike them with amazement, lest the heart should faint  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  015" id="21  015" >15</span>
 and the weak ones be multiplied at every gate—they are given up to the slaughter of the sword: it is well fitted for slaughter, it is well fitted for glittering.  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  016" id="21  016" >16</span>
 And do you go on, sharpen yourself on the right and on the left wherever your face may set itself.  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  017" id="21  017" >17</span>
 And I also will clap my hands, and let loose my fury: I the Lord have spoken   it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  018" id="21  018" >18</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  019" id="21  019" >19</span>
 and you, son of man, appoint you two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may enter in: the two shall go forth of one country; and   there shall be   a force at the top of the way of the city, you shall set   it   at the top of the way,  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  020" id="21  020" >20</span>
 that the sword may enter in upon Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and upon Judea, and upon Jerusalem in the midst thereof.  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  021" id="21  021" >21</span>
 For the king of Babylon shall stand on the old way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination, to make bright the arrow, and to enquire of the graven images, and to examine   the victims  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  022" id="21  022" >22</span>
 On his right was the divination against Jerusalem, to cast a mound, to open the mouth in shouting, to lift up the voice with crying, to cast a mound against her gates, to cast up a heap, and to build forts.  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  023" id="21  023" >23</span>
 And he was to them as one using divination before them, and he himself recounting his iniquities, that they might be borne in mind.  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  024" id="21  024" >24</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord, Because you° have caused your iniquities to be remembered, in the discovery of your wickedness, so that your sins should be seen, in all your wickedness and in your   evil   practices; because you° have caused remembrance   of them  , in these shall you° be taken.  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  025" id="21  025" >25</span>
 And you profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day,   even   an end, is come in a sea of iniquity, thus says the Lord;  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  026" id="21  026" >26</span>
 You have taken off the mitre and put on the crown, it shall not have such   another   after it: you have abased that which was high, and exalted that which was low.  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  027" id="21  027" >27</span>
 Injustice, injustice, injustice, will I make it: woe to it: such shall it be until he comes to whom it belongs; and I will deliver   it   to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  028" id="21  028" >28</span>
 And you, son of man, prophesy, and you shall say, Thus says the Lord, concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach; and you shall say, O sword, sword, drawn for slaughter, and drawn for destruction, awake, that you may gleam.  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  029" id="21  029" >29</span>
 While you are seeing vain   visions  , and while you are prophesying falsehoods, to bring yourself upon the necks of ungodly transgressors, the day is come,   even   an end, in a season of iniquity.  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  030" id="21  030" >30</span>
 Turn, rest not in this place wherein you were born: in your own land will I judge you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  031" id="21  031" >31</span>
 And I will pour out my wrath upon you, I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and I will deliver you into the hands of barbarians skilled in working destruction.  <span class="verse" rel="v02621  032" id="21  032" >32</span>
 You shall be fuel for fire; your blood shall be in the midst of your land; there shall be no remembrance at all of you: for I the Lord have spoken   it  .

<p><span class="chapter" id="22  001">22  </span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  002" id="22  002" >2</span>
 And you, son of man, will you judge the bloody city? yes, declare you to her all her iniquities.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  003" id="22  003" >3</span>
 And you shall say, Thus says the Lord God: O city that sheds blood in the midst of her, so that her time should come, and that forms devices against herself, to defile herself;  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  004" id="22  004" >4</span>
 in their blood which you have shed, you have transgressed; and in your devices which you have formed, you have polluted yourself; and you have brought near your days, and have brought on the time of your years: therefore have I made you a reproach to the Gentiles, and a mockery to all the countries,  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  005" id="22  005" >5</span>
 to those near you, and to those far distant from you; and they shall mock you,   you that are   notoriously unclean, and abundant in iniquities.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  006" id="22  006" >6</span>
 Behold, the princes of the house of Israel have conspired in you each one with his kindred, that they might shed blood.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  007" id="22  007" >7</span>
 In you they have reviled father and mother; and in you they have behaved unjustly toward the stranger: they have oppressed the orphan and widow.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  008" id="22  008" >8</span>
 And they have set at nothing my holy things, and in you they have profaned my sabbaths.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  009" id="22  009" >9</span>
    There are   robbers in you, to shed blood in you; and in you they have eaten upon the mountains: they have wrought ungodliness in the midst of you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  010" id="22  010" >10</span>
 In you they have uncovered the father's shame; and in you they have humbled her that was set apart for uncleanness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  011" id="22  011" >11</span>
 They have dealt unlawfully each one with his neighbor's wife; and each one in ungodliness has defiled his daughter-in-law: and in you they have humbled each one his sister, the daughter of his father.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  012" id="22  012" >12</span>
 In you they have received gifts to shed blood; they have received in you interest and usurious increase; and by oppression you have brought your wickedness to the full, and have forgotten me, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  013" id="22  013" >13</span>
 And if I shall strike my hand at   your iniquities   which you have accomplished, which you have wrought, and at your blood that has been shed in the midst of you,  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  014" id="22  014" >14</span>
 shall your heart endure? shall your hands be strong in the days which I bring upon you? I the Lord have spoken, and will do   it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  015" id="22  015" >15</span>
 And I will scatter you among the nations, and disperse you in the countries, and your uncleanness shall be removed out of you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  016" id="22  016" >16</span>
 And I will give heritages in you in the sight of the nations, and you° shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  017" id="22  017" >17</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  018" id="22  018" >18</span>
 Son of man, behold, the house of Israel are all become to me   as it were   mixed with brass, and iron, and tin, and lead; they are mixed up in the midst of the silver.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  019" id="22  019" >19</span>
 Therefore say, Thus says the Lord God; Because you° have become one mixture, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  020" id="22  020" >20</span>
 As silver, and brass, and iron, and tin, and lead, are gathered into the midst of the furnace, to blow fire into it, that they may be melted: so will I take   you   in my wrath, and I will gather and melt you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  021" id="22  021" >21</span>
 And I will blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and you° shall be melted in the midst thereof.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  022" id="22  022" >22</span>
 As silver is melted in the midst of a furnace, so shall you° be melted in the midst thereof; and you° shall know that I the Lord have poured out my wrath upon you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  023" id="22  023" >23</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  024" id="22  024" >24</span>
 Son of man, say to her, You are the land that is not rained upon, neither has rain come upon you in the day of wrath;  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  025" id="22  025" >25</span>
 whose princes in the midst of her are as roaring lions seizing prey, devouring souls by oppression, and taking bribes; and your widows are multiplied in the midst of you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  026" id="22  026" >26</span>
 Her priests also have set at nothing my law, and profaned my holy things: they have not distinguished between the holy and profane, nor have they distinguished between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I was profaned in the midst of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  027" id="22  027" >27</span>
 Her princes in the midst of her are as wolves ravening to shed blood, that they may get dishonest gain.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  028" id="22  028" >28</span>
 And her prophets that daub them shall fall, that see vanities, that prophesy falsehoods, saying, Thus says the Lord, when the Lord has not spoken.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  029" id="22  029" >29</span>
 That sorely oppress the people of the land with injustice, and commit robbery; oppressing the poor and needy, and not dealing justly with the stranger.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  030" id="22  030" >30</span>
 And I sought from among them a man behaving uprightly, and standing before me perfectly in the time of wrath, so that I should not utterly destroy her: but I found   him   not.  <span class="verse" rel="v02622  031" id="22  031" >31</span>
 So I have poured out my wrath upon her in the fury of my anger, to accomplish   it  . I have recompensed their ways on their own heads, says the Lord God.

<p><span class="chapter" id="23  001">23  </span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  002" id="23  002" >2</span>
 Son of man, there were two women, daughters of one mother:  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  003" id="23  003" >3</span>
 and they went a-whoring in Egypt in their youth: there their breasts fell, there they lost their virginity.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  004" id="23  004" >4</span>
 And their names were Oola the elder, and Ooliba her sister: and they were mine, and bore sons and daughters: and   as for   their names, Samaria was Oola, and Jerusalem was Ooliba.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  005" id="23  005" >5</span>
 And Oola went a-whoring from me, and doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians that were her neighbors,  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  006" id="23  006" >6</span>
 clothed with purple, princes and captains;   they were   young men and choice, all horseman riding on horses.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  007" id="23  007" >7</span>
 And she bestowed her fornication upon them; all were choice sons of the Assyrians: and on whoever she doted herself, with them she defiled herself in all   their   devices.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  008" id="23  008" >8</span>
 And she forsook not her fornication with the Egyptians: for in her youth they committed fornication with her, and they deflowered her, and poured out their fornication upon her.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  009" id="23  009" >9</span>
 Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the children of the Assyrians, on whom she doted.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  010" id="23  010" >10</span>
 They uncovered her shame: they took her sons and daughters, and killed her with the sword: and she became a byword among women: and they wrought vengeance in her for the sake of the daughters.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  011" id="23  011" >11</span>
 And her sister Ooliba saw   it  , and she indulged in her fondness more corruptly than she, and in her fornication more than the fornication of her sister.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  012" id="23  012" >12</span>
 She doted upon the sons of the Assyrian, princes and captains, her neighbors, clothed with fine linen, horsemen riding on horses;   they were   all choice young men.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  013" id="23  013" >13</span>
 And I saw that they were defiled,   that   the two   had   one way.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  014" id="23  014" >14</span>
 And she increased her fornication, and she saw men painted on the wall, likenesses of the Chaldeans painted with a pencil,  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  015" id="23  015" >15</span>
 having variegated girdles on their loins, having also richly dyed   attire   upon their heads; all had a princely appearance, the likeness of the children of the Chaldeans, of their native land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  016" id="23  016" >16</span>
 And she doted upon them as soon as she saw them, and sent forth messengers to them into the land of the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  017" id="23  017" >17</span>
 And the sons of Babylon came to her, into the bed of rest, and they defiled her in her fornication, and she was defiled by them, and her soul was alienated from them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  018" id="23  018" >18</span>
 And she exposed her fornication, and exposed her shame: and my soul was alienated from her, even as my soul was alienated from her sister.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  019" id="23  019" >19</span>
 And you did multiply your fornication, so as to call to remembrance the days of your youth, wherein you did commit whoredom in Egypt,  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  020" id="23  020" >20</span>
 and you did dote upon the Chaldeans, whose flesh is as the flesh of the asses, and their members   as   the members of horses.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  021" id="23  021" >21</span>
 And you did look upon the iniquity of your youth,   the things   which you wrought in Egypt in your lodgings, where were the breasts of your youth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  022" id="23  022" >22</span>
 Therefore, Ooliba, thus says the Lord; Behold, I   will   stir up your lovers against you, from whom your soul is alienated, and I will bring them upon you round about,  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  023" id="23  023" >23</span>
 the children of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans, Phacuc, and Sue, and Hychue, and all the sons of the Assyrians with them; choice young men, governors and captains, all princes and renowned, riding on horses.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  024" id="23  024" >24</span>
 And they all shall come upon you from the north, chariots and wheels, with a multitude of nations, shields and targets; and   the enemy   shall set a watch against you round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall take vengeance on you with their judgments.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  025" id="23  025" >25</span>
 And I will bring upon you my jealousy, and they shall deal with you in great wrath: they shall take away your nose and your ears; and shall cast down your remnant with the sword: they shall take your sons and your daughters; and your remnant fire shall devour.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  026" id="23  026" >26</span>
 And they shall strip you of your raiment, and take   away   your ornaments.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  027" id="23  027" >27</span>
 So I will turn back your ungodliness from you, and your fornication from the land of Egypt: and you shall not lift up your eyes upon them, and shall no more remember Egypt.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  028" id="23  028" >28</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord God; Behold, I   will   deliver you into the hands of those whom you hate, from whom your soul is alienated.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  029" id="23  029" >29</span>
 And they shall deal with you in hatred, and shall take all   the fruits   of your labors and your toils, and you shall be naked and bare: and the shame of your fornication shall be exposed: and your ungodliness and your fornication  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  030" id="23  030" >30</span>
 brought this upon you, in that you went a-whoring after the nations, and did defile yourself with their devices.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  031" id="23  031" >31</span>
 You did walk in the way of your sister; and I will put her cup into your hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  032" id="23  032" >32</span>
 Thus says the Lord; Drink your sister's cup, deep and large, and full, to cause complete drunkenness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  033" id="23  033" >33</span>
 And you shall be thoroughly weakened; and the cup of destruction, the cup of your sister Samaria,  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  034" id="23  034" >34</span>
 drink you it, and I will take away her feasts and her new moons: for I have spoken   it  , says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  035" id="23  035" >35</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord; Because you have forgotten me, and cast me behind your back, therefore receive you   the reward   of your ungodliness and your fornication.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  036" id="23  036" >36</span>
 And the Lord said to me, Son of man, will you not judge Oola and Ooliba? and declare to them their iniquities?  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  037" id="23  037" >37</span>
 For they have committed adultery, and blood was in their hands, they committed adultery with their devices, and they passed through the fire to them their children which they bore to me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  038" id="23  038" >38</span>
 So long too as they did these things to me, they defiled my sanctuary, and profaned my sabbaths.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  039" id="23  039" >39</span>
 And when they sacrificed their children to their idols, they also went into my sanctuary to profane it: and whereas they did thus in the midst of my house;  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  040" id="23  040" >40</span>
 and whereas they did thus to the men that came from afar, to whom they sent messengers, and as soon as they came, immediately you did wash yourself, and did paint your eyes and adorn yourself with ornaments,  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  041" id="23  041" >41</span>
 and sat on a prepared bed, and before it   there was   a table set out, and   as for   my incense and my oil, they rejoiced in them,  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  042" id="23  042" >42</span>
 and they raised a sound of music, and   that   with men coming from the wilderness out of a multitude of men, and they put bracelets on their hands, and a crown of glory on their heads;  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  043" id="23  043" >43</span>
 Therefore I said, Do they not commit adultery with these? and has she also gone a-whoring   after   the manner of a harlot?  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  044" id="23  044" >44</span>
 And they went in to her, as   men   go in to a harlot; so they went in to Oola and to Ooliba to work iniquity.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  045" id="23  045" >45</span>
 And they are just men, and shall take vengeance on them with the judgment of an adulteress and the judgment of blood: for they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  046" id="23  046" >46</span>
 Thus says the Lord God, Bring up a multitude upon them, and send trouble and plunder into the midst of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  047" id="23  047" >47</span>
 And stone them with the stones of a multitude, and pierce them with their swords: they shall kill their sons and their daughters, and shall burn up their houses.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  048" id="23  048" >48</span>
 And I will remove ungodliness out of the land, and all the women shall be instructed, and shall not do according to their ungodliness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02623  049" id="23  049" >49</span>
 And your ungodliness shall be recompensed upon you, and you° shall bear the guilt of your devices: and you° shall know that I am the Lord.

<p><span class="chapter" id="24  001">24  </span> And the word of the Lord came to me, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth   day   of the month, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  002" id="24  002" >2</span>
 Son of man, write for yourself daily from this day, on which the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem,   even   from this day.  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  003" id="24  003" >3</span>
 And speak a parable to the provoking house, and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord; Set on the caldron, and pour water into it:  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  004" id="24  004" >4</span>
 and put the pieces into it, every prime piece, the leg and shoulder taken off from the bones,  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  005" id="24  005" >5</span>
    which are   taken from choice cattle, and burn the bones under them: her bones are boiled and cooked in the midst of her.  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  006" id="24  006" >6</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord; O bloody city, the caldron in which there is scum, and the scum has not gone out of, she has brought it forth piece by piece, no lot has fallen upon it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  007" id="24  007" >7</span>
 For her blood is in the midst of her; I have set it upon a smooth rock: I have not poured it out upon the earth, so that the earth should cover it;  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  008" id="24  008" >8</span>
 that my wrath should come up for complete vengeance to be taken: I set her blood upon a smooth rock, so as not to cover it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  009" id="24  009" >9</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord, I will also make the firebrand great,  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  010" id="24  010" >10</span>
 and I will multiply the wood, and kindle the fire, that the flesh may be consumed, and the liquor boiled away;  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  011" id="24  011" >11</span>
 and that   it   may stand upon the coals, that her brass may be thoroughly heated, and be melted in the midst of her filthiness, and her scum may be consumed,  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  012" id="24  012" >12</span>
 and her abundant scum may not come forth of her.  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  013" id="24  013" >13</span>
 Her scum shall become shameful, because you did defile yourself: and what if you shall be purged no more until I have accomplished my wrath?  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  014" id="24  014" >14</span>
 I the Lord have spoken; and it shall come, and I will do   it  ; I will not delay, neither will I have any mercy: I will judge you, says the Lord, according to your ways, and according to your devices: therefore will I judge you according to your bloodshed, and according to your devices will I judge you, you unclean, notorious, and abundantly provoking one.  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  015" id="24  015" >15</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  016" id="24  016" >16</span>
 Son of man, behold I take from you the desire of your eyes by violence: you shall not lament, neither shall you weep.  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  017" id="24  017" >17</span>
 You shall groan for blood, and have mourning upon your loins; your hair shall not be braided upon you, and your sandals   shall be   on your feet; you shall in no wise be comforted by their lips, and you shall not eat the bread of men.  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  018" id="24  018" >18</span>
 And I spoke to the people in the morning, as he commanded me in the evening, and I did in the morning as it was commanded me.  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  019" id="24  019" >19</span>
 And the people said to me, Will you not tell us what these things are that you do?  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  020" id="24  020" >20</span>
 Then I said to them, The word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  021" id="24  021" >21</span>
 Say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord; Behold, I   will   profane my sanctuary, the boast of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and for which your souls are concerned; and your sons and your daughters, whom you° have left, shall fall by the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  022" id="24  022" >22</span>
 And you° shall do as I have done: you° shall not be comforted at their mouth, and you° shall not eat the bread of men.  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  023" id="24  023" >23</span>
 And your hair   shall be   upon your head, and your shoes on your feet: neither shall you° at all lament or weep; but you° shall pine away in your iniquities, and shall comfort every one his brother.  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  024" id="24  024" >24</span>
 And Jezekiel shall be for a sign to you: according to all that I have done shall you° do, when these things shall come; and you° shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  025" id="24  025" >25</span>
 And you, son of man,   shall it   not   be   in the day when I take their strength from them, the pride of their boasting, the desires of their eyes, and the pride of their soul, their sons and their daughters,  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  026" id="24  026" >26</span>
 that in that day he that escapes shall come to you, to tell   it   you in your ears?  <span class="verse" rel="v02624  027" id="24  027" >27</span>
 In that day your mouth shall be opened to him that escapes; you shall speak, and shall be no longer dumb: and you shall be for a sign to them, and they shall know that I am the Lord.

<p><span class="chapter" id="25  001">25  </span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02625  002" id="25  002" >2</span>
 Son of man, set your face steadfastly against the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them;  <span class="verse" rel="v02625  003" id="25  003" >3</span>
 and you shall say to the children of Ammon, Hear you° the word of the Lord; thus says the Lord; Forasmuch as you° have rejoiced against my sanctuary, because it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, because it was laid waste; and against the house of Juda, because they went into captivity;  <span class="verse" rel="v02625  004" id="25  004" >4</span>
 therefore, behold, I   will   deliver you to the children of Kedem for an inheritance, and they shall lodge in you with their stuff, and they shall pitch their tents in you: they shall eat your fruits, and they shall drink your milk.  <span class="verse" rel="v02625  005" id="25  005" >5</span>
 And I will give up the city of Ammon for camels' pastures, and the children of Ammon for a pasture of sheep: and you° shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02625  006" id="25  006" >6</span>
 For thus says the Lord; Because you have clapped your hands, and stamped with your foot, and heartily rejoiced against the land of Israel;  <span class="verse" rel="v02625  007" id="25  007" >7</span>
 therefore I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will make you a spoil to the nations; and I will utterly destroy you from among the peoples, and I will completely cut you off from out of the countries: and you shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02625  008" id="25  008" >8</span>
 Thus says the Lord; Because Moab has said, Behold, are not the house of Israel and Juda like all the   other   nations?  <span class="verse" rel="v02625  009" id="25  009" >9</span>
 Therefore, behold, I will weaken the shoulder of Moab from his frontier cities,   even   the choice land, the house of Bethasimuth above the fountain of the city, by the sea-side.  <span class="verse" rel="v02625  010" id="25  010" >10</span>
 I have given him the children of Kedem in addition to the children of Ammon for an inheritance, that there may be no remembrance of the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02625  011" id="25  011" >11</span>
 And I will execute vengeance on Moab; and they shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02625  012" id="25  012" >12</span>
 Thus says the Lord; Because of what the Idumeans have done in taking vengeance on the house of Juda, and   because they   have remembered injuries, and have exacted full recompense;  <span class="verse" rel="v02625  013" id="25  013" >13</span>
 therefore thus says the Lord; I will also stretch out my hand upon Idumea, and will utterly destroy out of it man and beast; and will make it desolate; and they that are pursued out of Thaeman shall fall by the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v02625  014" id="25  014" >14</span>
 And I will execute my vengeance on Idumea by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall deal in Idumea according to my anger and according to my wrath, and they shall know my vengeance, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02625  015" id="25  015" >15</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord, Because the Philistines have wrought revengefully, and raised up vengeance rejoicing from their heart to destroy   the Israelites   to a man;  <span class="verse" rel="v02625  016" id="25  016" >16</span>
 therefore thus says the Lord; Behold, I   will   stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and will utterly destroy the Cretans, and will cut off the remnant that dwell by the sea-coast.  <span class="verse" rel="v02625  017" id="25  017" >17</span>

 Son of man, because Sor has said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is crushed: the nations are destroyed: she is turned to me: she that was full is made desolate:  <span class="verse" rel="v02626  003" id="26  003" >3</span>
 therefore thus says the Lord; Behold, I am against you, O Sor, and I will bring up many nations against you, as the sea comes up with its waves.  <span class="verse" rel="v02626  004" id="26  004" >4</span>
 And they shall cast down the walls of Sor, and shall cast down your towers: and I will scrape her dust from off her, and make her a bare rock.  <span class="verse" rel="v02626  005" id="26  005" >5</span>
 She shall be in the midst of the sea a place for repairing nets: for I have spoken   it  , says the Lord: and it shall be a spoil for the nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v02626  006" id="26  006" >6</span>
 And her daughters   which are   in the field shall be slain with the sword, and they shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02626  007" id="26  007" >7</span>
 For thus says the Lord; Behold, I   will   bring up against you, O Sor, Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon from the north: he is a king of kings, with horses, and chariots, and horsemen, and a concourse of very many nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v02626  008" id="26  008" >8</span>
 He shall kill your daughters that are in the field with the sword, and shall set a watch against you, and build forts around you, and carry a rampart round against you, and set up warlike works, and array his spears against you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02626  009" id="26  009" >9</span>
 He shall cast down with his swords your walls and your towers.  <span class="verse" rel="v02626  010" id="26  010" >10</span>
 By reason of your multitude of his horses their dust shall cover you, and by reason of the sound of his horsemen and the wheels of his chariots the walls shall be shaken, when he enters into your gates, as one entering into a city from the plain.  <span class="verse" rel="v02626  011" id="26  011" >11</span>
 With the hoofs of his horses they shall trample all your streets: he shall kill your people with the sword, and shall bring down to the ground the support of your strength.  <span class="verse" rel="v02626  012" id="26  012" >12</span>
 And he shall prey upon your power, and plunder your substance, and shall cast down your walls, and break down your pleasant houses: and he shall cast your stones and your timber and your dust into the midst of your sea.  <span class="verse" rel="v02626  013" id="26  013" >13</span>
 And he shall destroy the multitude of your musicians, and the sound of your lutes shall be heard no more.  <span class="verse" rel="v02626  014" id="26  014" >14</span>
 And I will make you a bare rock: you shall be a place to spread nets upon; you shall be built no more: for I the Lord have spoken   it  , says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02626  015" id="26  015" >15</span>
 For thus says the Lord God to Sor; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of your fall, while the wounded are groaning, while they have drawn a sword in the midst of you?  <span class="verse" rel="v02626  016" id="26  016" >16</span>
 And all the princes of the nations of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and shall take off their crowns from their heads, and shall take off their embroidered raiment: they shall be utterly amazed; they shall sit upon the ground, and fear their   own   destruction, and shall groan over you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02626  017" id="26  017" >17</span>
 And they shall take up a lamentation for you, and shall say to you, How are you destroyed from out of the sea, the renowned city, that brought her terror upon all her inhabitants.  <span class="verse" rel="v02626  018" id="26  018" >18</span>
 And the isles shall be alarmed at the day of your fall.  <span class="verse" rel="v02626  019" id="26  019" >19</span>
 For thus says the Lord God; When I shall make the city desolate, as the cities that shall not be inhabited, when I have brought the deep up upon you,  <span class="verse" rel="v02626  020" id="26  020" >20</span>
 and great waters shall cover you; and I shall bring you down to them that go down to the pit, to the people of old time, and shall cause you to dwell in the depths of the earth, as in everlasting desolation, with them that go down to the pit, that you may not be inhabited, nor stand upon the land of life;  <span class="verse" rel="v02626  021" id="26  021" >21</span>

 are you wiser than Daniel? or have not the wise instructed you with their knowledge?  <span class="verse" rel="v02628  004" id="28  004" >4</span>

 You were in the delight of the paradise of God; you have bound upon you every precious stone, the sardius, and topaz, and emerald, and carbuncle, and sapphire, and jasper, and silver, and gold, and ligure, and agate, and amethyst, and chrysolite, and beryl, and onyx: and you have filled your treasures and your stores in you with gold.  <span class="verse" rel="v02628  014" id="28  014" >14</span>

 You were faultless in your days, from the day that you were created, until iniquity was found in you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02628  016" id="28  016" >16</span>

 And I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will cause the fish of your river to stick to your sides, and I will bring you up out of the midst of your river:  <span class="verse" rel="v02629  005" id="29  005" >5</span>
 and I will quickly cast down you and all the fish of your river: you shall fall on the face of the plain, and shall by no means be gathered, and shall not be brought together: I have given you for food to the wild beasts of the earth and to the fowls of the sky.  <span class="verse" rel="v02629  006" id="29  006" >6</span>
 And all the dwellers in Egypt shall know that I am the Lord, because you have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02629  007" id="29  007" >7</span>
 When they took hold of you with their hand, you did break: and when every hand was clapped against them, and when they leaned on you, you were utterly broken, and did crush the loins of them all.  <span class="verse" rel="v02629  008" id="29  008" >8</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord; Behold, I   will   bring a sword upon you, and will cut off from you man and beast;  <span class="verse" rel="v02629  009" id="29  009" >9</span>
 and the land of Egypt shall be ruined and desert; and they shall know that I am the Lord; because you say, The rivers are mine, and I made them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02629  010" id="29  010" >10</span>
 Therefore, behold, I am against you, and against all your rivers, and I will give up the land of Egypt to desolation, and the sword, and destruction, from Magdol and Syene even to the borders of the Ethiopians.  <span class="verse" rel="v02629  011" id="29  011" >11</span>
 No foot of man shall pass through it, and no foot of beast shall pass through it, and it shall not be inhabited for forty years.  <span class="verse" rel="v02629  012" id="29  012" >12</span>
 And I will cause her land to be utterly destroyed in the midst of a land that is desolate, and her cities shall be   desolate   forty years in the midst of cities that are desolate: and I will disperse Egypt among the nations, and will utterly scatter them into the countries.  <span class="verse" rel="v02629  013" id="29  013" >13</span>
 Thus says the Lord; After forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the nations among whom they have been scattered;  <span class="verse" rel="v02629  014" id="29  014" >14</span>
 and I will turn the captivity of the Egyptians, and will cause them to dwell in the land of Phathore, in the land whence they were taken;  <span class="verse" rel="v02629  015" id="29  015" >15</span>
 and it shall be a base kingdom beyond all   other   kingdoms; it shall not any more be exalted over the nations; and I will make them few in number, that they may not be   great   among the nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v02629  016" id="29  016" >16</span>
 And they shall no more be to the house of Israel a confidence bringing iniquity to remembrance, when they follow after them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02629  017" id="29  017" >17</span>
 And it came to pass in the twenty-seventh year, on the first   day   of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02629  018" id="29  018" >18</span>
 Son of man, Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre; every head was bald, and every shoulder peeled; yet there was no reward to him or to his army   serving   against Tyre, nor for the service wherewith they served against it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02629  019" id="29  019" >19</span>
 Thus says the Lord God; Behold, I   will   give to Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon the land of Egypt, and he shall take the plunder thereof, and seize the spoils thereof; and   it   shall be a reward for his army.  <span class="verse" rel="v02629  020" id="29  020" >20</span>
 In return for his service wherewith he served against Tyre, I have given him the land of Egypt; thus says the Lord God:  <span class="verse" rel="v02629  021" id="29  021" >21</span>
 In that day shall a horn spring forth for all the house of Israel, and I will give you an open mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.

 his   hand   and his people's;   they are   plagues sent forth from the nations to destroy the land: and they all shall unsheath their swords against Egypt, and the land shall be filled with slain.  <span class="verse" rel="v02630  012" id="30  012" >12</span>

 Son of man, I have broken the arms of Pharao, king of Egypt; and, behold, it has not been bound up to be healed, to have a plaster put upon it,   or   to be strengthened to lay hold of the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v02630  022" id="30  022" >22</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="31  001">31  </span> And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first   day   of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02631  002" id="31  002" >2</span>
 Son of man, say to Pharao king of Egypt, and to his multitude; To whom have you compared yourself in your haughtiness?  <span class="verse" rel="v02631  003" id="31  003" >3</span>
 Behold, the Assyrian was a cypress in Libanus, and was fair in shoots, and high in stature: his top reached to the midst of the clouds.  <span class="verse" rel="v02631  004" id="31  004" >4</span>
 The water nourished him, the depth made him grow tall; she led her rivers round about his plants, and she sent forth her streams to all the trees of the field.  <span class="verse" rel="v02631  005" id="31  005" >5</span>
 Therefore was his stature exalted above all the trees of the field, and his branches spread far by the help of much water.  <span class="verse" rel="v02631  006" id="31  006" >6</span>
 All the birds of the sky made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches all the wild beasts of the field bred; the whole multitude of nations lived under his shadow.  <span class="verse" rel="v02631  007" id="31  007" >7</span>
 And he was fair in his height by reason of the multitude of his branches: for his roots were amidst much water.  <span class="verse" rel="v02631  008" id="31  008" >8</span>
 And such cypresses   as this   were in the paradise of God; and there were no pines like his shoots, and there were no firs like his branches: no tree in the paradise of God was like him in his beauty,  <span class="verse" rel="v02631  009" id="31  009" >9</span>
 because of the multitude of his branches: and the trees of God's paradise of delight envied him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02631  010" id="31  010" >10</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord; Because you are grown great, and have set your top in the midst of the clouds, and I saw when he was exalted;  <span class="verse" rel="v02631  011" id="31  011" >11</span>
 therefore I delivered him into the hands of the prince of the nations, and he wrought his destruction.  <span class="verse" rel="v02631  012" id="31  012" >12</span>
 And ravaging strangers from the nations have destroyed him, and have cast him down upon the mountains: his branches fell in all the valleys, and his boughs were broken in every field of the land; and all the people of the nations are gone down from their shelter, and have laid him low.  <span class="verse" rel="v02631  013" id="31  013" >13</span>
 All the birds of the sky have settled on his fallen trunk, and all the wild beasts of the field came upon his boughs:  <span class="verse" rel="v02631  014" id="31  014" >14</span>
 in order that none of the trees by the water should exalt themselves by reason of their size: whereas they set their top in the midst of the clouds, yet they continued not in their high state in their place, all that drank water, all were consigned to death, to the depth of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.  <span class="verse" rel="v02631  015" id="31  015" >15</span>
 Thus says the Lord God; In the day wherein he went down to Hades, the deep mourned for him: and I stayed her floods, and restrained her abundance of water: and Libanus saddened for him, all the trees of the field fainted for him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02631  016" id="31  016" >16</span>
 At the sound of his fall the nations quaked, when I brought him down to Hades with them that go down to the pit: and all the trees of Delight comforted him in the heart, and the choice of   plants   of Libanus, all that drink water.  <span class="verse" rel="v02631  017" id="31  017" >17</span>
 For they went down to hell with him among the slain with the sword; and his seed,   even   they that lived under his shadow, perished in the midst of their life.  <span class="verse" rel="v02631  018" id="31  018" >18</span>
 To whom are you compared? descend, and be you debased with the trees of paradise to the depth of the earth: you shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword. Thus shall Pharao be, and the multitude of his host, says the Lord God.

<p><span class="chapter" id="32  001">32  </span> And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the tenth month, on the first   day   of the month,   that   the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  002" id="32  002" >2</span>
 Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharao king of Egypt, and say to him, You are become like a lion of the nations, and as a serpent that is in the sea: and you did make assaults with your rivers, and did disturb the water with your feet, and did trample your rivers.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  003" id="32  003" >3</span>
 Thus says the Lord; I will also cast over you the nets of many nations, and will bring you up with my hook:  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  004" id="32  004" >4</span>
 and I will stretch you upon the earth: the fields shall be covered   with you  , and I will cause all the birds of the sky to settle upon you, and I will fill   with you   all the wild beasts of the earth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  005" id="32  005" >5</span>
 And I will cast your flesh upon the mountains, and will saturate   them   with your blood.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  006" id="32  006" >6</span>
 And the land shall be drenched with your dung, because of your multitude upon the mountains: I will fill the valleys with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  007" id="32  007" >7</span>
 And I will veil the heavens when you are extinguished, and will darken the stars thereof; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  008" id="32  008" >8</span>
 All the   bodies   that give light in the sky, shall be darkened over you, and I will bring darkness upon the earth, says the Lord God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  009" id="32  009" >9</span>
 And I will provoke to anger the heart of many people, when I shall lead you captive among the nations, to a land which you have not known.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  010" id="32  010" >10</span>
 And many nations shall mourn over you, and their kings shall be utterly amazed, when my sword flies in their faces, as they wait for their   own   fall from the day of your fall.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  011" id="32  011" >11</span>
 For thus says the Lord God; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon you,  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  012" id="32  012" >12</span>
 with the swords of mighty men; and I will cast down your strength:   they are   all destroying ones from the nations, and they shall destroy the pride of Egypt, and all her strength shall be crushed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  013" id="32  013" >13</span>
 And I will destroy all her cattle from   beside   the great water; and the foot of man shall not trouble it any more, and the step of cattle shall no more trample it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  014" id="32  014" >14</span>
 Thus shall their waters then be at rest, and their rivers shall flow like oil, says the Lord,  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  015" id="32  015" >15</span>
 when I shall give up Egypt to destruction, and the land shall be made desolate with the fullness thereof; when I shall scatter all that dwell in it, and they shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  016" id="32  016" >16</span>
 There is a lamentation, and you shall utter it; and the daughters of the nations shall utter it,   even   for Egypt, and they shall mourn for it over all the strength thereof, says the Lord God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  017" id="32  017" >17</span>

 Son of man, lament over the strength of Egypt, for the nations shall bring down her daughters dead to the depth of the earth, to them that go down to the pit.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  020" id="32  020" >20</span>
 They shall fall with him in the midst of them   that are   slain with the sword, and all his strength shall perish: the giants also shall say to you,  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  021" id="32  021" >21</span>
 Be you in the depth of the pit: to whom are you superior? yes, go down, and lie with the uncircumcised, in the midst of them   that are   slain with the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  022" id="32  022" >22</span>
 There are Assur and all his company: all   his   slain have been laid there:  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  023" id="32  023" >23</span>
 and their burial is in the depth of the pit, and his company are set around about his tomb: all the slain that fell by the sword, who had caused the fear of them   to be   upon the land of the living.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  024" id="32  024" >24</span>
 There is Aelam and all his host round about his tomb: all the slain that fell by the sword, and the uncircumcised that go down to the deep of the earth, who caused their fear to be upon the land of the living: and they have received their punishment with them that go down to the pit,  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  025" id="32  025" >25</span>

 And they are laid with the giants that fell of old, who went down to Hades with   their   weapons of war: and they laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities were upon their bones, because they terrified all men during their life.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  028" id="32  028" >28</span>
 And you shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that have been slain by the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  029" id="32  029" >29</span>
 There are laid the princes of Assur, who yielded their strength to a wound of the sword: these are laid with the slain, with them that go down to the pit.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  030" id="32  030" >30</span>
 There are the princes of the north,   even   all the captains of Assur, who go down slain   to Hades  : they lie uncircumcised among the slain with the sword together with their terror and their strength, and they have received their punishment with them that go down to the pit.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  031" id="32  031" >31</span>
 King Pharao shall see them, and shall be comforted over all their force, says the Lord God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02632  032" id="32  032" >32</span>
 For I have caused his fear to be upon the land of the living yet he shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword,   even   Pharao, and all his multitude with him, says the Lord God.

<p><span class="chapter" id="33  001">33  </span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  002" id="33  002" >2</span>
 Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and you shall say to them, On whatever land I shall bring a sword, and the people of the land take one man of them, and set him for their watchman:  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  003" id="33  003" >3</span>
 and he shall see the sword coming upon the land, and blow the trumpet, and sound an alarm to the people;  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  004" id="33  004" >4</span>
 and he that hears the sound of the trumpet shall hear   indeed  , and   yet   not take heed, and the sword shall come upon him, and overtake him, his blood shall be upon his   own   head.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  005" id="33  005" >5</span>
 Because he heard the sound of the trumpet, and took no heed, his blood shall be upon him: but the other, because he took heed, has delivered his soul.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  006" id="33  006" >6</span>
 But if the watchman see the sword coming, and do not sound the trumpet, and the people do not watch; and the sword come, and take a soul from among them, that   soul   is taken because of its iniquity; but the blood   thereof   will I require at the watchman's hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  007" id="33  007" >7</span>
 And you, son of man, I have set you   as   a watchman to the house of Israel, and you shall hear a word from my mouth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  008" id="33  008" >8</span>
 When I say to the sinner, You shall surely die;   if   you speak not to warn the wicked from his way, the wicked himself shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  009" id="33  009" >9</span>
 But if you forewarn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he turn not from his way, he shall die in his ungodliness; but you have delivered your own soul.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  010" id="33  010" >10</span>
 And you, son of man, say to the house of Israel; Thus have you° spoken, saying, Our errors, and our iniquities weigh upon us, and we pine away in them, and how then shall we live?  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  011" id="33  011" >11</span>
 Say to them, Thus says the Lord;   As   I live, I desire not the death of the ungodly, as that the ungodly should turn from his way and live: turn you° heartily from your way; for why will you° die, O house of Israel?  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  012" id="33  012" >12</span>
 Say to the children of your people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him, in the day wherein he errs: and the iniquity of the ungodly shall not harm him, in the day wherein he turns from his iniquity, but the righteous   erring   shall not be able to deliver himself.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  013" id="33  013" >13</span>
 When I say to the righteous,   You shall live; and   he trusts in his righteousness, and shall commit iniquity, none of his righteousnesses shall be remembered; in his unrighteousness which he has wrought, in it shall he die.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  014" id="33  014" >14</span>
 And when I say to the ungodly, You shall surely die; and he shall turn from his sin, and do judgment and justice,  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  015" id="33  015" >15</span>
 and return the pledge, and repay that which he has robbed,   and   walk in the ordinances of life, so as to do no wrong; he shall surely live, and shall not die.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  016" id="33  016" >16</span>
 None of his sins which he has committed shall be remembered: because he has wrought judgment and righteousness; by them shall he live.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  017" id="33  017" >17</span>
 Yet the children of your people will say, The way of the Lord is not straight: whereas this their way is not straight.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  018" id="33  018" >18</span>
 When the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and shall commit iniquities, then shall he die in them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  019" id="33  019" >19</span>
 And when the sinner turns from his iniquity, and shall do judgment and righteousness, he shall live by them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  020" id="33  020" >20</span>
 And this is that which you° said, The way of the Lord is   not   straight. I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one for his ways.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  021" id="33  021" >21</span>
 And it came to pass in the tenth year of our captivity, in the twelfth month, on the fifth   day   of the month,   that   one that had escaped from Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city is taken.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  022" id="33  022" >22</span>
 Now the hand of the Lord had come upon me in the evening, before he came; and he opened my mouth, when he came to me in the morning: and my mouth was open, it was no longer kept closed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  023" id="33  023" >23</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  024" id="33  024" >24</span>
 Son of man, they that inhabit the desolate   places   on the land of Israel say, Abram was one, and he possessed the land: and we are more numerous; to us the land is given for a possession.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  027" id="33  027" >27</span>
 Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord God,   As   I live, surely they that are in the desolate places shall fall by swords and they that are in the open plain shall be given for food to the wild beasts of the field, and them that are in the fortified   cities   and them that are in the caves I will kill with pestilence.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  028" id="33  028" >28</span>
 And I will make the land desert, and the pride of her strength shall perish; and the mountains of Israel shall be made desolate by reason of no man passing through.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  029" id="33  029" >29</span>
 And they shall know that I am the Lord; and I will make their land desert, and it shall be made desolate because of all their abominations which they have wrought.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  030" id="33  030" >30</span>
 And   as for   you, son of man, the children of your people are they that speak concerning you by the walls, and in the porches of the houses, and they talk one to another, saying, Let us come together, and let us hear the   words   that proceed from the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  031" id="33  031" >31</span>
 They approach you as a people comes together, and sit before you, and hear your words, but they will not do them: for   there is   falsehood in their mouth, and their heart   goes   after their pollutions.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  032" id="33  032" >32</span>
 And you are to them as a sound of a sweet, well-tuned lute, and they will hear your words, but they will not do them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02633  033" id="33  033" >33</span>
 But whenever it shall come   to pass  , they will say, Behold, it is come: and they shall know that there was a prophet in the midst of them.

<p><span class="chapter" id="34  001">34  </span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  002" id="34  002" >2</span>
 Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say to the shepherds, Thus says the Lord God; O shepherds of Israel, do shepherds feed themselves? do not the shepherds feed the sheep?  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  003" id="34  003" >3</span>
 Behold, you° feed on the milk, and clothe yourselves with the wool, and kill the fat: but you° feed not my sheep.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  004" id="34  004" >4</span>
 The weak one you° have not strengthened, and the sick you° have not cherished, and the bruised you° have not bound up, and the stray one you° have not turned back, and the lost you° have not sought; and the strong you° have wearied with labor.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  005" id="34  005" >5</span>
 And my sheep were scattered, because there were no shepherds: and they became meat to all the wild beasts of the field.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  006" id="34  006" >6</span>
 And my sheep were scattered on every mountain, and on every high hill: yes, they were scattered on the face of the earth, and there was none to seek them out, nor to bring them back.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  007" id="34  007" >7</span>
 Therefore, you° shepherds, hear the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  008" id="34  008" >8</span>
    As   I live, says the Lord God, surely because my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became meat to all the wild beasts of the field, because there were no shepherds, and the shepherds sought not out my sheep, and the shepherds fed themselves, but fed not my sheep.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  009" id="34  009" >9</span>
 For this cause, O shepherds,  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  010" id="34  010" >10</span>
 thus says the Lord God, Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my sheep at their hands, and will turn them back that they shall not feed my sheep, and the shepherds shall no longer feed them; and I will deliver my sheep out of their mouth, and they shall no longer be meat for them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  011" id="34  011" >11</span>
 For thus says the Lord God, Behold, I will seek out my sheep, and will visit them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  012" id="34  012" >12</span>
 As the shepherd seeks his flock, in the day when there is darkness and cloud, in the midst of the sheep that are separated: so will I seek out my sheep, and will bring them back from every place where they were scattered in the day of cloud and darkness.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  013" id="34  013" >13</span>
 And I will bring them out from the Gentiles, and will gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land, and will feed them upon the mountains of Israel, and in the valleys, and in every inhabited place of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  014" id="34  014" >14</span>
 I will feed them in a good pasture, on a high mountain of Israel: and their folds shall be there, and they shall lie down, and there shall they rest in perfect prosperity, and they shall feed in a fat pasture on the mountains of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  015" id="34  015" >15</span>
 I will feed my sheep, and I will cause them to rest; and they shall know that I am the Lord: thus says the Lord God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  016" id="34  016" >16</span>
 I will seek that which is lost, and I will recover the stray one, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen the fainting, and will guard the strong, and will feed them with judgment.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  017" id="34  017" >17</span>
 And   as for   you, you° sheep, thus says the Lord God, Behold, I will distinguish between sheep and sheep,   between   rams and he-goats.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  018" id="34  018" >18</span>
 And   is it   not enough for you that you° fed on the good pasture, that you° trampled with your feet the remnant of your pasture? and   that   you° drank the standing water,   that   you° disturbed the residue with your feet?  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  019" id="34  019" >19</span>
 So my sheep fed on that which you° had trampled with your feet; and they drank the water that had been disturbed by your feet.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  020" id="34  020" >20</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord God; Behold, I will separate between the strong sheep and the weak sheep.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  021" id="34  021" >21</span>
 You° did thrust with your sides and shoulders, and pushed with your horns, and you° cruelly treated all the sick.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  022" id="34  022" >22</span>
 Therefore I will save my sheep, and they shall not be any more for a prey; and will judge between ram and ram.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  023" id="34  023" >23</span>
 And I will raise up one shepherd over them, and he shall tend them,   even   my servant David, and he shall be their shepherd;  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  024" id="34  024" >24</span>
 and I the Lord will be to them a God, and David a prince in the midst of them; I the Lord have spoken it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  025" id="34  025" >25</span>
 And I will make with David a covenant of peace and I will utterly destroy evil beasts from off the land; and they shall dwell in the wilderness, and sleep in the forests.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  026" id="34  026" >26</span>
 And I will settle them round about my mountain; and I will give you the rain, the rain of blessing.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  027" id="34  027" >27</span>
 And the trees that are in the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield her strength, and they shall dwell in the confidence of peace on their land, and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have broken their yoke; and I will deliver them out of the hand of those that enslaved them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  028" id="34  028" >28</span>
 And they shall no more be a spoil to the nations, and the wild beasts of the land shall no more at all devour them; and they shall dwell safely, and there shall be none to make them afraid.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  029" id="34  029" >29</span>
 And I will raise up for them a plant of peace, and they shall no more perish with hunger upon the land, and they shall no more bear the reproach of the nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  030" id="34  030" >30</span>
 And they shall know that I am the Lord their God, and they my people. O house of Israel, says the Lord God,  <span class="verse" rel="v02634  031" id="34  031" >31</span>
 you° are my sheep, even the sheep of my flock, and I am the Lord your God, says the Lord God.

<p><span class="chapter" id="35  001">35  </span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02635  002" id="35  002" >2</span>
 Son of man, set your face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,  <span class="verse" rel="v02635  003" id="35  003" >3</span>
 and say to it, Thus says the Lord God; Behold, I am against you, O mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you, and will make you a waste, and you shall be made desolate.  <span class="verse" rel="v02635  004" id="35  004" >4</span>
 And I will cause desolation in your cities, and you shall be desolate, and you shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02635  005" id="35  005" >5</span>
 Because you have been a perpetual enemy, and have laid wait craftily for the house of Israel, with the hand of enemies with a sword, in the time of injustice, at the last:  <span class="verse" rel="v02635  006" id="35  006" >6</span>
 Therefore, as I live, says the Lord God, verily you have sinned even to blood, therefore blood shall pursue you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02635  007" id="35  007" >7</span>
 And I will make mount Seir a waste, and desolate, and I will destroy from off it men and cattle:  <span class="verse" rel="v02635  008" id="35  008" >8</span>
 and I will fill your hills and your valleys with slain men, and in all your plains there shall fall in you men slain with the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v02635  009" id="35  009" >9</span>
 I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities shall not be inhabited any more: and you shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02635  010" id="35  010" >10</span>
 Because you said, The two nations and the two countries shall be mine, and I shall inherit them; whereas the Lord is there:  <span class="verse" rel="v02635  011" id="35  011" >11</span>
 therefore,   as   I live, says the Lord, I will even deal with you according to your enmity, and I will be made known to you when I shall judge you:  <span class="verse" rel="v02635  012" id="35  012" >12</span>
 and you shall know that I am the Lord. I have heard the voice of your blasphemies, whereas you have said, The desert mountains of Israel are given to us for food;  <span class="verse" rel="v02635  013" id="35  013" >13</span>
 and you have spoken swelling words against me with your mouth: I have heard   them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02635  014" id="35  014" >14</span>
 Thus says the Lord; When all the earth is rejoicing, I will make you desert.  <span class="verse" rel="v02635  015" id="35  015" >15</span>
 You shall be desert, O mount Seir, and all Idumea; and it shall be utterly consumed: and you shall know that I am the Lord their God.

<p><span class="chapter" id="36  001">36  </span> And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say to the mountains of Israel, Hear you° the word of the Lord:  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  002" id="36  002" >2</span>
 Thus says the Lord God; Because the enemy has said against you, Aha, the old waste places are become a possession for us:  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  003" id="36  003" >3</span>
 therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord God; Because you° have been dishonored, and hated by those round about you, that you° might be a possession to the remainder of the nations, and you° became a byword, and a reproach to the nations:  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  004" id="36  004" >4</span>
 therefore, you° mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord; Thus says the Lord to the mountains, and to the hills, and to the streams, and to the valleys, and to   the places   that have been made desolate and destroyed, and to the cities that have been deserted, and have become a spoil and a trampling to the nations that were left round about;  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  005" id="36  005" >5</span>
 therefore, thus says the Lord; Verily in the fire of my wrath have I spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Idumea, because they have appropriated my land to themselves for a possession with joy, disregarding the lives   of the inhabitants  , to destroy   it   by plunder:  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  006" id="36  006" >6</span>
 therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, and to the hills, and to the valleys, and to the forests, Thus says the Lord; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because you° have borne the reproaches of the heathen:  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  007" id="36  007" >7</span>
 therefore I will lift up my hand against the nations that are round about you; they shall bear their reproach.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  008" id="36  008" >8</span>
 But your grapes and your fruits, O mountains of Israel, shall my people eat; for they are hoping to come.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  009" id="36  009" >9</span>
 For, behold, I am toward you, and I will have respect to you, and you° shall be tilled and sown:  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  010" id="36  010" >10</span>
 and I will multiply men upon you,   even   all the house of Israel to the end: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the desolate land shall be built upon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  011" id="36  011" >11</span>
 And I will multiply men and cattle upon you; and I will cause you to dwell as at the beginning, and will treat you well, as in your former   times  : and you° shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  012" id="36  012" >12</span>
 And I will increase men upon you,   even   my people Israel; and they shall inherit you, and you° shall be to them for a possession; and you° shall no more be bereaved of them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  013" id="36  013" >13</span>
 Thus says the Lord God: Because they said to you, You   land   devour men, and have been bereaved of your nation;  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  014" id="36  014" >14</span>
 therefore you shall no more devour men, and you shall no more bereave your nation, says the Lord God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  015" id="36  015" >15</span>
 And there shall no more be heard against you the reproach of the nations, and you° shall no more bear the revilings of the peoples, says the Lord God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  016" id="36  016" >16</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  017" id="36  017" >17</span>
 Son of man, the house of Israel lived upon their land, and defiled it by their way, and with their idols, and with their uncleannesses; and their way was before me like the uncleanness of a removed woman.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  018" id="36  018" >18</span>
 So I poured out my wrath upon them:  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  019" id="36  019" >19</span>
 and I dispersed them among the nations, and utterly scattered them through the countries: I judged them according to their way and according to their sin.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  020" id="36  020" >20</span>
 And they went in among the nations, among which they went, and they profaned my holy name, while it was said of them, These are the people of the Lord, and they came forth out of his land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  021" id="36  021" >21</span>
 But I spared them for the sake of my holy name, which the house of Israel profaned among the nations, among whom they went.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  022" id="36  022" >22</span>
 Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord; I do not this, O house of Israel, for your sakes, but because of my holy name, which you° have profaned among the nations, among whom you° went.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  023" id="36  023" >23</span>
 And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the nations, which you° profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am the Lord, when I am sanctified among you before their eyes.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  024" id="36  024" >24</span>
 And I will take you out from the nations, and will gather you out of all the lands, and will bring you into your own land:  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  025" id="36  025" >25</span>
 and I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you° shall be purged from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols, and I will cleanse you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  026" id="36  026" >26</span>
 And I will give you a new heart, and will put a new spirit in you: and I will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh, and will give you a heart of flesh.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  027" id="36  027" >27</span>
 And I will put my Spirit in you, and will cause you to walk in my ordinances, and to keep my judgments, and do   them  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  028" id="36  028" >28</span>
 And you° shall dwell upon the land which I gave to your fathers; and you° shall be to me a people, and I will be to you a God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  029" id="36  029" >29</span>
 And I will save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and multiply it, and will not bring famine upon you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  030" id="36  030" >30</span>
 And I will multiply the fruit of the trees, and the produce of the field, that you° may not bear the reproach of famine among the nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  031" id="36  031" >31</span>
 And you° shall remember your evil ways and your practices that were not good, and you° shall be hateful in your own sight for your transgressions and for your abominations.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  032" id="36  032" >32</span>
 Not for your sakes do I   this  , says the Lord God,   as   it is known to you: be you° ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  033" id="36  033" >33</span>
 Thus says the Lord God; In the day wherein I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities I will also cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste   places   shall be built upon:  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  034" id="36  034" >34</span>
 and the desolate land shall be cultivated, whereas it was desolate in the eyes of every one that passed by.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  035" id="36  035" >35</span>
 And they shall say, That desolate land is become like a garden of delight; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are inhabited.  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  036" id="36  036" >36</span>
 And the nations, as many as shall have been left round about you, shall know that I the Lord have built the ruined   cities   and planted the waste   lands  : I the Lord have spoken, and will do   it  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  037" id="36  037" >37</span>
 Thus says the Lord God; Yet   for   this will I be sought by the house of Israel, to establish them; I will multiply them   even   men as sheep;  <span class="verse" rel="v02636  038" id="36  038" >38</span>
 as holy sheep, as the sheep of Jerusalem in her feasts; thus shall the desert cities be full of flocks of men: and they shall know that I   am   the Lord.

 And he said to me, Son of man, will these bones live? and I said, O Lord God, you know this.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  004" id="37  004" >4</span>
 And he said to me, Prophesy upon these bones, and you shall say to them, You° dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  005" id="37  005" >5</span>
 Thus says the Lord to these bones; Behold, I   will   bring upon you the breath of life:  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  006" id="37  006" >6</span>
 and I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and will spread skin upon you, and will put my Spirit into you, and you° shall live; and you° shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  007" id="37  007" >7</span>
 So I prophesied as   the Lord   commanded me: and it came to pass while I was prophesying, that, behold,   there was   a shaking, and the bones approached each one to his joint.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  008" id="37  008" >8</span>
 And I looked, and behold, sinews and flesh grew upon them, and skin came upon them above: but there was not breath in them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  009" id="37  009" >9</span>
 And he said to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus says the Lord; Come from the four winds, and breathe upon these dead   men  , and let them live.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  010" id="37  010" >10</span>
 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath entered into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, a very great congregation.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  011" id="37  011" >11</span>
 And the Lord spoke to me, saying, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: and they say, Our bones are become dry, our hope has perished, we are quite spent.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  012" id="37  012" >12</span>
 Therefore prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord; Behold, I   will   open your tombs, and will bring you up out of your tombs, and will bring you into the land of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  013" id="37  013" >13</span>
 And you° shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, that I may bring up my people from   their   graves.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  014" id="37  014" >14</span>
 And I will put my Spirit within you, and you° shall live, and I will place you upon your own land: and you° shall know that I   am   the Lord; I have spoken, and will do   it  , says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  015" id="37  015" >15</span>
 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  016" id="37  016" >16</span>
 Son of man, take for yourself a rod, and write upon it, Juda, and the children of Israel his adherents; and you shall take for yourself another rod, and you shall inscribe it for Joseph, the rod of Ephraim, and all the children of Israel that belong to him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  017" id="37  017" >17</span>
 And you shall joint them together for yourself, so as that they should bind themselves into one stick; and they shall be in your hand.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  018" id="37  018" >18</span>
 And it shall come to pass, when the children of your people shall say to you, Will you not tell us what you meanest by these things?  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  019" id="37  019" >19</span>
 Then shall you say to them, Thus says the Lord; behold, I will take the tribe of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel that belong to him, and I will add them to the tribe of Juda, and they shall become one rod in the hand of Juda.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  020" id="37  020" >20</span>
 And the rods on which you did write shall be in your hand in their presence.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  021" id="37  021" >21</span>
 And you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord God; Behold, I   will   take the whole house of Israel out of the midst of the nations, among whom they have gone, and I will gather them from all that are round about them, and I will bring them into the land of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  022" id="37  022" >22</span>
 And I will make them a nation in my land, even on the mountains of Israel; and they shall have one prince: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided any more at all into two kingdoms:  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  023" id="37  023" >23</span>
 that they may no more defile themselves with their idols; and I will deliver them from all their transgressions whereby they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be to me a people, and I the Lord will be to them a God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  024" id="37  024" >24</span>
 And my servant David   shall be   a prince in the midst of them: there shall be one shepherd of   them   all; for they shall walk in my ordinances, and keep my judgments, and do them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  025" id="37  025" >25</span>
 And they shall dwell in their land, which I have given to my servant Jacob, where their fathers lived; and they shall dwell upon it: and David my servant   shall be their   prince forever.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  026" id="37  026" >26</span>
 And I will make with them a covenant of peace; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will establish my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  027" id="37  027" >27</span>
 And my tabernacle shall be among them; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be my people.  <span class="verse" rel="v02637  028" id="37  028" >28</span>
 And the nations shall know that I am the Lord that sanctifies them, when my sanctuary is in the midst of them for ever.

<p><span class="chapter" id="38  001">38  </span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  002" id="38  002" >2</span>
 Son of man, set your face against Gog, and the land of Magog, Rhos, prince of Mesoch and Thobel, and prophesy against him,  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  003" id="38  003" >3</span>
 and say to him, Thus says the Lord God; Behold, I am against you, Rhos prince of Mesoch and Thobel:  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  004" id="38  004" >4</span>
 and I will gather you, and all your host, horses and horsemen, all wearing breastplates, with a great multitude, shields and helmets and swords:  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  005" id="38  005" >5</span>
 Persians, and Ethiopians, and Libyans; all with helmets and shields.  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  006" id="38  006" >6</span>
 Gomer, and all belonging to him; the house of Thorgama, from the end of the north, and all belonging to him; and many nations with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  007" id="38  007" >7</span>
 Be you prepared, prepare yourself, you, and all your multitude that is assembled with you, and you shall be to me for a guard.  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  008" id="38  008" >8</span>
 He shall be prepared after many days, and he shall come at the end of years, and shall come to a land that is brought back from the sword, when   the people   are gathered from many nations against the land of Israel, which was entirely desolate: and he is come forth out of the nations, and they shall all dwell securely.  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  009" id="38  009" >9</span>
 And you shall go up as rain, and shall arrive as a cloud to cover the land, and there shall be you, and all that are about you, and many nations with you.  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  010" id="38  010" >10</span>
 Thus says the Lord God; It shall also come to pass in that day, that thoughts shall come up into your heart, and you shall devise evil devices.  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  011" id="38  011" >11</span>
 And you shall say, I will go up to the rejected land; I will come upon them that are at ease in tranquility, and dwelling in peace, all inhabiting a land in which there is no wall, nor bars, nor have they doors;  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  012" id="38  012" >12</span>
 to seize plunder, and to take their spoil; to turn my hands against the desolate land that is   now   inhabited, and against a nation that is gathered from many nations, that have acquired property, dwelling in the midst of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  013" id="38  013" >13</span>
 Sabba, and Daedan, and Carthaginian merchants, and all their villages shall say to you, You are come for plunder to take a prey, and to get spoils: you have gathered your multitude to take silver and gold, to carry off property, to take spoils.  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  014" id="38  014" >14</span>
 Therefore prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog, Thus says the Lord; Will you not arise in that day, when my people Israel are dwelling securely,  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  015" id="38  015" >15</span>
 and come out of your place from the farthest north, and many nations with you? all of them mounted on horses, a great gathering, and a large force?  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  016" id="38  016" >16</span>
 And you shall come up upon my people Israel as a cloud to cover the land; it shall come to pass in the last days, that I will bring you up upon my land, that all the nations may know me, when I am sanctified in you before them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  017" id="38  017" >17</span>
 Thus says the Lord God, to Gog; You are   he   concerning whom I spoke in former times, by the hand of my servants the prophets of Israel, in those days and years, that I would bring you up against them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  018" id="38  018" >18</span>
 And it shall come to pass in that day, in the day when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, says the Lord God,  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  019" id="38  019" >19</span>
    that   my wrath and my jealousy shall arise, I have spoken in the fire of my anger, verily in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  020" id="38  020" >20</span>
 and the fish of the sea shall quake at the presence of the Lord, and the birds of the sky and the wild beasts of the field, and all the reptiles that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are on the face of the earth; and the mountains shall be tore, and the valleys shall fall, and every wall on the land shall fall.  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  021" id="38  021" >21</span>
 And I will summon against it even every fear, says the Lord: the sword of   every   man shall be against his brother.  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  022" id="38  022" >22</span>
 And I will judge him with pestilence, and blood, and sweeping rain, and hailstones; and I will rain upon him fire and brimstone, and upon all that are with him, and upon many nations with him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02638  023" id="38  023" >23</span>

 and I will assemble you, and guide you, and raise you up on the extremity of the north, and I will bring you up upon the mountains of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02639  003" id="39  003" >3</span>
 And I will destroy the bow out of your left hand, and your arrows out of your right hand, and I will cast you down on the mountains of Israel;  <span class="verse" rel="v02639  004" id="39  004" >4</span>
 and you and all that belong to you shall fall, and the nations that are with you shall be given to multitudes of birds,   even   to every fowl, and I have given you to all the wild beasts of the field to be devoured.  <span class="verse" rel="v02639  005" id="39  005" >5</span>
 You shall fall on the face of the field: for I have spoken   it  , says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02639  006" id="39  006" >6</span>
 And I will send a fire upon Gog, and the islands shall be securely inhabited: and they shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02639  007" id="39  007" >7</span>
 And my holy name shall be known in the midst of my people Israel; and my holy name shall no more be profaned: and the nations shall know that I am the Lord, the Holy   One   in Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02639  008" id="39  008" >8</span>
 Behold it is come, and you shall know that it shall be, says the Lord God; this is the day concerning which I have spoken.  <span class="verse" rel="v02639  009" id="39  009" >9</span>
 And they that inhabit the cities of Israel shall come forth, and make a fire with the arms, the shields and the spears, and bows and arrows, and hand-staves, and lances, and they shall keep fire burning with them for seven years:  <span class="verse" rel="v02639  010" id="39  010" >10</span>
 and they shall not take any wood out of the field, neither shall they cut any out of the forests, but they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall plunder those that plundered them, and spoil those that spoiled them, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02639  011" id="39  011" >11</span>
 And it shall come to pass   that   in that day I will give to Gog a place of renown, a tomb in Israel, the burial-place of them that approach the sea: and they shall build round about the outlet of the valley, and there they shall bury Gog and all his multitude: and   the place   shall then be called the burial-place of Gog.  <span class="verse" rel="v02639  012" id="39  012" >12</span>

 And you, son of man, say, Thus says the Lord; Say to every winged bird, and to all the wild beasts of the field, Gather yourselves, and come; gather yourselves from all   places   round about to my sacrifice, which I have made for you,   even   a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, and you° shall eat flesh, and drink blood.  <span class="verse" rel="v02639  018" id="39  018" >18</span>

 And the house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God, from this day and onwards.  <span class="verse" rel="v02639  023" id="39  023" >23</span>
 And all the nations shall know that the house of Israel were led captive because of their sins, because they rebelled against me, and I turned away my face from them, and delivered them into the hands of their enemies, and they all fell by the sword.  <span class="verse" rel="v02639  024" id="39  024" >24</span>
 According to their uncleannesses and according to their transgressions did I deal with them, and I turned away my face from them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02639  025" id="39  025" >25</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord God, Now will I turn back captivity in Jacob, and will have mercy on the house of Israel, and will be jealous for the sake of my holy name.  <span class="verse" rel="v02639  026" id="39  026" >26</span>
 And they shall bear their reproach, and the iniquity which they committed when they lived upon their land in peace. Yet there shall be none to terrify   them    <span class="verse" rel="v02639  027" id="39  027" >27</span>

 And they shall know that I am the Lord their God, when I have been manifested to them among the nations.  <span class="verse" rel="v02639  029" id="39  029" >29</span>
 And I will no more turn away my face from them, because I have poured out my wrath upon the house of Israel, says the Lord God.

<p><span class="chapter" id="40  001">40  </span> And it came to pass in the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the first month, on the tenth   day   of the month, in the fourteenth year after the taking of the city, in that day the hand of the Lord was upon me, and brought me  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  002" id="40  002" >2</span>
 in a vision of God into the land of Israel, and set me on a very high mountain, and upon it   there was   as it were the frame of a city before   me  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  003" id="40  003" >3</span>
 And he brought me in there, and, behold,   there was   a man, and the appearance of him was as the appearance of shining brass, and in his hand was a builder's line, and a measuring reed; and he stood at the gate.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  004" id="40  004" >4</span>
 And the man said to me, Look with your eyes at him whom you have seen, son of man, and hear with your ears, and lay up in your heart all things that I show you; for you have come in hither that   I   might show you, and you shall show all things that you see to the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  005" id="40  005" >5</span>
 And behold a wall round about the house without, and in the man's hand a reed, the measure   of it was   six cubits by the cubit, and a span: and he measured across the front wall; the breadth was equal to the reed, and the length of it equal to the reed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  006" id="40  006" >6</span>
 And he entered by seven steps into the gate that looks eastward, and he measured across the porch of the gate equal to the reed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  007" id="40  007" >7</span>
 And the chamber was equal in length to the reed, and equal in breadth to the reed; and the porch between the chambers six cubits; and the second chamber equal in breadth to the reed, and equal in length to the reed, and the porch five cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  008" id="40  008" >8</span>
 And the third chamber equal in length to the reed, and equal in breadth to the reed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  009" id="40  009" >9</span>
 And the porch of the gateway (near the porch of the gate) eight cubits; and the posts there of two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward:  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  010" id="40  010" >10</span>
 and the chambers of the gate of the chamber in front   were   three on one side and three on the other, and   there was   one measure to the three:   there was   one measure to the porches on this side and on that.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  011" id="40  011" >11</span>
 And he measured the breadth of the door of the gateway, ten cubits; and the breadth of the gateway thirteen cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  012" id="40  012" >12</span>
 And the space before the chambers was narrowed to a cubit in front of the chambers on this side and on that side: and the chamber was six cubits this way, and six cubits that way.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  013" id="40  013" >13</span>
 And he measured the gate from the wall of one chamber to the wall of the other chamber: the breadth was twenty-five cubits, the one gate over against the other gate.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  014" id="40  014" >14</span>
 And the open space of the porch of the gate without, was twenty cubits to the chambers round about the gate.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  015" id="40  015" >15</span>
 And the open space of the gate without to the open space of the porch of the gate within was fifty cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  016" id="40  016" >16</span>
 And   there were   secret windows to the chambers, and to the porches within the gate of the court round about, and in the same manner windows to the porches round about within: and on the porch   there were   palm-trees on this side and on that side.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  017" id="40  017" >17</span>
 And he brought me into the inner court, and, behold,   there were   chambers, and peristyles round about the court; thirty chambers within the ranges of columns.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  018" id="40  018" >18</span>
 And the porticos were behind the gates; according to the length of the gates, was the lower peristyle.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  019" id="40  019" >19</span>
 And he measured the breadth of the court, from the open space of the outer gate inwards to the open space of the gate looking outwards: a hundred cubits   was the distance to the place   of the gate looking eastward: and he brought me to the north;  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  020" id="40  020" >20</span>
 and behold a gate looking northwards   belonging to   the outer court, and he measured it, both the length of it and the breadth;  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  021" id="40  021" >21</span>

 And its windows, and its porches, and its palm-trees, were according to   the dimensions of   the gate looking eastward; and they went up to it by seven steps; and the porches were within.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  023" id="40  023" >23</span>
 And   there was   a gate to the inner court looking toward the north gate, after the manner of the gate looking toward the east; and he measured the court from gate to gate, a hundred cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  024" id="40  024" >24</span>
 And he brought me to the south side, and behold a gate looking southwards: and he measured it, and its chambers, and its posts, and its porches, according to these dimensions.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  025" id="40  025" >25</span>
 And its windows and its porches round about were according to the windows of the porch: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof was five and twenty cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  026" id="40  026" >26</span>
 And it had seven steps, and porches within: and it   had   palm-trees on the posts, one on one side, and one on the other side.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  027" id="40  027" >27</span>
 And   there was   a gate opposite the gate of the inner court southward: and he measured the court from gate to gate, a hundred cubits in breadth southward.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  028" id="40  028" >28</span>
 And he brought me into the inner court of the south gate: and he measured the gate according to these measures;  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  029" id="40  029" >29</span>
 and the chambers, and the posts,  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  030" id="40  030" >30</span>
 and the porches, according to these measures: and   there were   windows to it and to the porches round about: its length was fifty cubits, and   its   breadth twenty-five cubits,  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  031" id="40  031" >31</span>
 from the porch to the outer court: and   there were   palm-trees to the post   thereof  , and eight steps.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  032" id="40  032" >32</span>
 And he brought me in at the gate that looks eastward: and he measured it according to these measures:  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  033" id="40  033" >33</span>
 and the chambers, and the posts, and the porches according to these measures: and   there were   windows to it, and porches round about: the length of it was fifty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty-five cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  034" id="40  034" >34</span>
 And   there were   porches   opening   into the inner court, and palm-trees on the posts on this side and on that side: and it   had   eight steps.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  035" id="40  035" >35</span>
 And he brought me in at the northern gate, and measured   it   according to these measures;  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  036" id="40  036" >36</span>
 and the chambers, and the posts, and the porches: and it   had   windows round about, and   it had   its porches: the length of it was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  037" id="40  037" >37</span>
 And its porches were toward the inner court; and   there were   palm-trees to the posts on this side and on that side: and it   had   eight steps.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  038" id="40  038" >38</span>
 Its chambers and its door-ways, and its porches at the second gate   served as   a drain,  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  039" id="40  039" >39</span>
 that they might kill in it the sin-offerings, and the trespass-offerings.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  040" id="40  040" >40</span>
 And behind the drain for the whole burnt offerings at the north   gate  , two tables eastward behind the second gate; and   behind   the porch of the gate two tables eastward.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  041" id="40  041" >41</span>
 Four on one side and four on the other side behind the gate; upon them they kill the victims, in front of the eight tables of sacrifices.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  042" id="40  042" >42</span>
 And   there were   four tables of hewn stone for whole burnt offerings, the breadth   of them was   a cubit and a half, and the length   of them   two cubits   and   a half, and   their   height was a cubit: on them they shall place the instruments with which they kill there the whole burnt offerings and the victims.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  043" id="40  043" >43</span>
 And they shall have within a border of hewn stone round about of a span broad, and over the tables above screens for covering   them   from the wet and from the heat.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  044" id="40  044" >44</span>
 And he brought me into the inner court, and behold   there were   two chambers in the inner court, one behind the gate looking to the north, turning southward, and one behind the southern gate, but which looks to the north.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  045" id="40  045" >45</span>
 And he said to me, This chamber that looks to the south, is for the priests that keep the charge of the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  046" id="40  046" >46</span>
 And the chamber that looks to the north is for the priests that keep the charge of the altar: they are the sons of Sadduc, those of the tribe of Levi who draw near to the Lord to serve him.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  047" id="40  047" >47</span>
 And he measured the court, the length   whereof was   a hundred cubits, and the breadth a hundred cubits, on its four sides; and the altar in front of the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  048" id="40  048" >48</span>
 And he brought me into the porch of the house; and he measured the post of the porch, the breadth was five cubits on one side and five cubits on the other side; and the breadth of the door   was   fourteen cubits, and the side-pieces of the door of the porch   were   three cubits on one side, and three cubits on the other side.  <span class="verse" rel="v02640  049" id="40  049" >49</span>
 And the length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth twelve cubits; and they went up to it by ten steps; and   there were   pillars to the porch, one on this side and one on that side.  
<!-- 41   049 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="41  001">41  </span> And he brought me into the temple, the porch of which he measured, six cubits the breadth on one side, and six cubits the breadth of the porch on the other side.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  002" id="41  002" >2</span>
 And the breadth of the gateway was ten cubits, and the side-pieces of the gateway were five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and he measured the length of it, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  003" id="41  003" >3</span>
 And he went into the inner court, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the side-pieces of the door, seven cubits on one side, and seven cubits on the other side.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  004" id="41  004" >4</span>
 And he measured the length of the doors, forty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, in front of the temple: and he said, This is the holy of holies.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  005" id="41  005" >5</span>
 And he measured the wall of the house, six cubits: and the breadth of   each   side, four cubits round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  006" id="41  006" >6</span>
 And the sides were twice ninety, side against side; and   there was   a space in the wall of the house at the sides round about, that they should be for them that take hold of them to see, that they should not at all touch the walls of the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  007" id="41  007" >7</span>
 And the breadth of the upper side   was made   according to the projection out of the wall, against the upper one round about the house, that it might be enlarged above, and that   men   might go up to the upper chambers from those below, and from the ground-sills to the third story.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  008" id="41  008" >8</span>
 And as for the height of the house round about,   each   space between the sides was equal to a reed of six cubits;  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  009" id="41  009" >9</span>
 and the breadth of the wall of each side without was five cubits; and the spaces that were left between the sides of the house,  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  010" id="41  010" >10</span>
 and between the chambers, were a width of twenty cubits, the circumference of the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  011" id="41  011" >11</span>
 And the doors of the chambers were toward the space left by the one door that looked northward, and   there was   one door southward; and the breadth of the remaining open space   was   five cubits in extent round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  012" id="41  012" >12</span>
 And the partition   wall   in front of the remaining space, toward the west, was seventy cubits in breadth; the breadth of the partition wall was five cubits round about, and the length of it ninety cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  013" id="41  013" >13</span>
 And he measured in front of the house a length of a hundred cubits, and the remaining spaces and the partitions; and the walls thereof were in length a hundred cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  014" id="41  014" >14</span>
 And the breadth in front of the house, and the remaining   spaces   before   it were   a hundred cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  015" id="41  015" >15</span>
 And he measured the length of the partition in front of the space left by the back parts of that house; and the   spaces   left on this side and on that side were in length a hundred cubits: and the temple and the corners and the outer porch were ceiled.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  016" id="41  016" >16</span>
 And the windows were latticed,   giving   light round about to the three   stories  , so as to look through: and the house and the parts adjoining were planked round about, and   so was   the floor, and from the floor up to the windows, and the window   shutters   folded back in three parts for one to look through.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  017" id="41  017" >17</span>
 And almost all the way to the inner, and close to the outer   side  , and upon all the wall round about within and without,  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  018" id="41  018" >18</span>
 were carved cherubs and palm-trees between the cherubs,   and each   cherub   had   two faces.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  019" id="41  019" >19</span>
 The face of a man was toward one palm tree on this side and on that side, and the face of a lion toward another palm tree on this side and on that side: the house was carved all round.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  020" id="41  020" >20</span>
 From the floor to the ceiling were cherubs and palm-trees carved.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  021" id="41  021" >21</span>
 And the holy place and the temple opened on four sides; in front of the holy places the appearance was as the look of  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  022" id="41  022" >22</span>
 a wooden altar, the height of it three cubits, and the length two cubits, and the breadth two cubits; and it had horns, and the base of it and the sides of it were of wood: and he said to me, This is the table, which is before the face of the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  023" id="41  023" >23</span>
 And the temple   had   two doors, and the sanctuary   had   two doors, with two turning leaves   apiece  ;  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  024" id="41  024" >24</span>
 two leaves to the one, and two leaves to the other door.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  025" id="41  025" >25</span>
 And   there was   carved work upon them, and cherubs on the doors of the temple, and palm-trees according to the carving of the sanctuary; and   there were   stout planks in front of the porch without.  <span class="verse" rel="v02641  026" id="41  026" >26</span>
 And   there were   secret windows; and he measured from side to side, to the roofing of the porch; and the sides of the house were closely planked.  
<!-- 42   026 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="42  001">42  </span> And he brought me into the inner court eastward, opposite the northern gate: and he brought me in, and behold five chambers near the vacant space, and near the northern partition,  <span class="verse" rel="v02642  002" id="42  002" >2</span>
 a hundred cubits in length toward the north, and in breadth fifty,  <span class="verse" rel="v02642  003" id="42  003" >3</span>
 ornamented accordingly as the gates of the inner court, and arranged accordingly as the peristyles of the outer court,   with   triple porticos fronting one another.  <span class="verse" rel="v02642  004" id="42  004" >4</span>
 And in front of the chambers was a walk ten cubits in breadth, the length   reaching   to a hundred cubits; and their doors were northward.  <span class="verse" rel="v02642  005" id="42  005" >5</span>
 And the upper walks were in like manner: for the peristyle projected from it,   even   from the range of columns below, and   there was   a space between; so   were there   a peristyle and a space between, and so   were there   two porticos.  <span class="verse" rel="v02642  006" id="42  006" >6</span>
 For they were triple, and they had not pillars like the pillars of the outer ones: therefore they projected from the lower ones and the middle ones from the ground.  <span class="verse" rel="v02642  007" id="42  007" >7</span>
 And   there was   light without, corresponding to the chambers of the outer court looking toward the front of the northern chambers; the length   of them was   fifty cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v02642  008" id="42  008" >8</span>
 For the length of the chambers looking toward the inner court was fifty cubits, and these are the ones that front the others; the whole was a hundred cubits.  <span class="verse" rel="v02642  009" id="42  009" >9</span>
 And   there were   doors of these chambers for an outlet toward the east, so that one should go through them out of the outer court,  <span class="verse" rel="v02642  010" id="42  010" >10</span>
 by the opening of the walk at the corner; and the south parts were toward the south, toward the remaining space, and toward the partition, and   so were   the chambers.  <span class="verse" rel="v02642  011" id="42  011" >11</span>
 And the walk was in front of them, according to the measures of the chambers toward the north, both according to the length of them, and according to the breadth of them, and according to all their openings, an according to all their turnings, and according to their lights, and according to their doors.  <span class="verse" rel="v02642  012" id="42  012" >12</span>
    So were the measures   of the chambers toward the south, and according to the doors at the entrance of the walk, as it were the distance of a reed for light, and eastward as one went in by them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02642  013" id="42  013" >13</span>
 And he said to me, The chambers toward the north, and the chambers toward the south, in front of the void spaces, these are the chambers of the sanctuary, wherein the priests the sons of Sadduc, who draw night to the Lord, shall eat the most holy things: and there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat-offering, and the sin-offerings, and the trespass-offerings; because the place is holy.  <span class="verse" rel="v02642  014" id="42  014" >14</span>
 None shall go in there except the priests,   and   they shall not go forth of the holy place into the outer court, that they that draw near   to me   may be continually holy, and may not touch their garments in which they minister,   with defilement  , for they are holy; and they shall put on other garments whenever they come in contact with the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v02642  015" id="42  015" >15</span>
 So the measurement of the house within was accomplished: and he brought me forth by the way of the gate that looks eastward, and measured the plan of the house round about in order.  <span class="verse" rel="v02642  016" id="42  016" >16</span>
 And he stood behind the gate looking eastward, and measured five hundred   cubits   with the measuring reed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02642  017" id="42  017" >17</span>
 And he turned to the north and measured in front of the north   side   five hundred cubits with the measuring reed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02642  018" id="42  018" >18</span>
 And he turned to the west, and measured in front of the west side, five hundred   cubits   with the measuring reed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02642  019" id="42  019" >19</span>
 And he turned to the south, and measured in front of the south side, five hundred   cubits   by the measuring reed.  <span class="verse" rel="v02642  020" id="42  020" >20</span>
 The   four sides he measured   by the same reed, and he marked out the house and the circumference of the parts round about,   a space   of five hundred   cubits   eastward, and a breadth of five hundred cubits, to make a division between the sanctuary and the outer wall, that   belonged to   the design of the house.

<p><span class="chapter" id="43  001">43  </span> Moreover he brought me to the gate looking eastward, and led me forth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  002" id="43  002" >2</span>
 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came by the eastern way; and   there was   a voice of an army, as the sound of many redoubling   their shouts  , and the earth shone like light from the glory round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  003" id="43  003" >3</span>
 And the vision which I saw was like the vision which I saw when I went in to anoint the city: and the vision of the chariot which I saw was like the vision which I saw at the river Chobar; and I fell upon my face.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  004" id="43  004" >4</span>
 And the glory of the Lord came into the house, by the way of the gate looking eastward.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  005" id="43  005" >5</span>
 And the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the house of the Lord was full of glory.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  006" id="43  006" >6</span>
 And I stood, and behold   there was   a voice out of the house of one speaking to me, and a man stood near me,  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  007" id="43  007" >7</span>
 and he said to me, Son of man, you have seen the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, in which my name shall dwell in the midst of the house of Israel for ever; and the house of Israel shall no more profane my holy name, they and their princes, by their fornication, or by the murders of   their   princes in the midst of them;  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  008" id="43  008" >8</span>
 when they set my door-way by their door-way, and my thresholds near to their thresholds: and they made my wall as it were joining myself and them, and they profaned my holy name with their iniquities which they wrought: and I destroyed them in my wrath and with slaughter.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  009" id="43  009" >9</span>
 And now let them put away from me their fornication, and the murders of their princes, and I will dwell in the midst of them forever.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  010" id="43  010" >10</span>
 And you, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may cease from their sins; and   show   its aspect and the arrangement of it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  011" id="43  011" >11</span>
 And they shall bear their punishment for all the things that they have done: and you shall describe the house, and its entrances, and the plan thereof, and all its ordinances, and you shall make known to them all the regulations of it, and describe   them   before them: and they shall keep all my commandments, and all my ordinances, and do them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  012" id="43  012" >12</span>
 And you shall show the plan of the house on the top of the mountain: all its limits round about   shall be   most holy.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  013" id="43  013" >13</span>
 And these are the measures of the altar by the cubit of a cubit and a span, the cavity   shall be   a cubit deep, and a cubit shall be the breadth, and the border on the rim of it round about shall be a span: and this   shall be   the height of the altar  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  014" id="43  014" >14</span>
 from the bottom at the commencement of the hollow part to this great mercy-seat, from beneath was two cubits, and the breadth was a cubit; and from the little mercy-seat to the great mercy-seat, four cubits, and the breadth was a cubit.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  015" id="43  015" >15</span>
 And the altar   shall be   four cubits; and from the altar and above the horns a cubit.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  016" id="43  016" >16</span>
 And the altar   shall be   of the length of twelve cubits, by twelve cubits   in breadth  , square upon its four sides.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  017" id="43  017" >17</span>
 And the mercy-seat   shall be   fourteen cubits in length, by fourteen cubits in breadth on its four sides; and   there shall be   a border to it carried round about it of half a cubit; and the rim of it   shall be   a cubit round about; and the steps thereof looking eastward.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  018" id="43  018" >18</span>
 And he said to me, Son of man, thus says the Lord God of Israel; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day of its being made, to offer upon it whole burnt offerings, and to pour blood upon it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  019" id="43  019" >19</span>
 And you shall appoint to the priests the Levites of the seed of Sadduc, that draw near to me, says the Lord God, to minister to me, a calf of the herd for a sin-offering.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  020" id="43  020" >20</span>
 And they shall take of its blood, and shall put   it   on the four horns of the altar, and upon the four corners of the propitiatory, and upon the base round about, and they shall make atonement for it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  021" id="43  021" >21</span>
 And they shall take the calf of the sin-offering, and it shall be consumed by fire in the separate place of the house, outside the sanctuary.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  022" id="43  022" >22</span>
 And on the second day they shall take two kids of the goats without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall make atonement for the altar, as they made atonement with the calf.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  023" id="43  023" >23</span>
 And after they have finished the atonement, they shall bring an unblemished calf of the herd, and an unblemished ram of the flock.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  024" id="43  024" >24</span>
 And you° shall offer   them   before the Lord, and the priests shall sprinkle salt upon them, and shall offer them up   as   whole burnt offerings to the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  025" id="43  025" >25</span>
 Seven days shall you offer a kid daily for a sin-offering, and a calf of the herd, and a ram out of the flock: they shall sacrifice them unblemished for seven days:  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  026" id="43  026" >26</span>
 and they shall make atonement for the altar, and shall purge it; and they shall consecrate themselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v02643  027" id="43  027" >27</span>
 And it shall come to pass from the eighth day and onward,   that   the priests shall offer your whole burnt offerings on the altar, and your peace-offerings; and I will accept you, says the Lord.

<p><span class="chapter" id="44  001">44  </span> Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary that looks eastward; and it was shut.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  002" id="44  002" >2</span>
 And the Lord said to me, This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no one shall pass through it; for the Lord God of Israel shall enter by it, and it shall be shut.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  003" id="44  003" >3</span>
 For the prince, he shall sit in it, to eat bread before the Lord; he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go forth by the way of the same.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  004" id="44  004" >4</span>
 And he brought me in by the way of the gate that looks northward, in front of the house: and I looked, and, behold, the house was full of the glory of the Lord: and I fell upon my face.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  005" id="44  005" >5</span>
 And the Lord said to me, Son of man, attend with your heart, and see with   your   eyes, and hear with your ears all that I say to you, according to all the ordinances of the house of the Lord, and all the regulations thereof; and you shall attend well to the entrance of the house, according to all its outlets, in all the holy things.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  006" id="44  006" >6</span>
 And you shall say to the provoking house,   even   to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God; Let it suffice you   to have committed   all your iniquities, O house of Israel!  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  007" id="44  007" >7</span>
 that you° have brought in aliens, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, and to profane it, when you° offered bread, flesh, and blood; and you° transgressed my covenant by all your iniquities;  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  008" id="44  008" >8</span>
 and you° appointed   others   to keep the charges in my sanctuary.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  009" id="44  009" >9</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord God; No alien, uncircumcised in heart or uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of all the children of strangers that are in the midst of the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  010" id="44  010" >10</span>
 But as for the Levites who departed far from me when Israel went astray from me after their imaginations, they shall even bear their iniquity.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  011" id="44  011" >11</span>
 yet they shall minister in my sanctuary,   being   porters at the gates of the house, and serving the house: they shall kill the victims and the whole burnt offerings for the people, and they shall stand before the people to minister to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  012" id="44  012" >12</span>
 Because they ministered to them before their idols, and it became to the house of Israel a punishment of iniquity; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, says the Lord God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  013" id="44  013" >13</span>
 And they shall not draw near to me to minister to me in the priests' office, nor to approach the holy things of the children of Israel, nor   to approach   my holy of holies: but they shall bear their reproach for the error wherein they erred.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  014" id="44  014" >14</span>
 They shall bring them to keep the charges of the house, for all the service of it, and for all that they shall do.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  015" id="44  015" >15</span>
 The priests the Levites, the sons of Sadduc, who kept the charges of my sanctuary when the house of Israel went astray from me, these shall draw night to me to minister to me, and shall stand before my face, to offer sacrifice to me, the fat and the blood, says the Lord God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  016" id="44  016" >16</span>
 These shall enter into my sanctuary, and these shall approach my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my charges.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  017" id="44  017" >17</span>
 And it shall come to pass when they enter the gates of the inner court,   that   they shall put on linen robes; and they shall not put on woollen garments when they minister at the gate of the inner court.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  018" id="44  018" >18</span>
 And they shall have linen mitres upon their heads, and shall have linen drawers upon their loins; and they shall not tightly gird themselves.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  019" id="44  019" >19</span>
 And when they go out into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their robes, in which they minister; and they shall lay them up in the chambers of the sanctuary, and shall put on other robes, and they shall not sanctify the people with their robes.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  020" id="44  020" >20</span>
 And they shall not shave their heads, nor shall they pluck off their hair; they shall carefully cover their heads.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  021" id="44  021" >21</span>
 And no priest shall drink any wine, when they go into the inner court.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  022" id="44  022" >22</span>
 Neither shall they take to themselves to wife a widow, or one that is put away, but a virgin of the seed of Israel: but if there should happen to be a priest's widow, they shall take   her  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  023" id="44  023" >23</span>
 And they shall teach my people   to distinguish   between holy and profane, and they shall make known to them   the difference   between unclean and clean.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  024" id="44  024" >24</span>
 And these shall attend at a judgment of blood to decide it: they shall rightly observe my ordinances, and judge my judgments, and keep my statutes and my commandments in all my feasts; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  025" id="44  025" >25</span>
 And they shall not go in to the dead body of a man to defile themselves: only   a priest   may defile himself for a father, or for a mother, or for a son, or for a daughter, or for a brother, or for his sister, who has not been married.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  026" id="44  026" >26</span>
 And after he has been cleansed, let him number to himself seven days.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  027" id="44  027" >27</span>
 And on whatever day they shall enter into the inner court to minister in the holy place, they shall bring a propitiation, says the Lord God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  028" id="44  028" >28</span>
 And it shall be to them for an inheritance: I am their inheritance: and no possession shall be given them among the children of Israel; for I am their possession.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  029" id="44  029" >29</span>
 And these shall eat the meat-offerings, and the sin-offerings, and the trespass-offerings; and every special offering in Israel shall be theirs.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  030" id="44  030" >30</span>
    And   the first fruits of all things, and the firstborn of all   animals   and all offerings, of all your first fruits there shall be   a share   for the priests; and you° shall give your earliest produce to the priest, to bring your blessings upon your houses.  <span class="verse" rel="v02644  031" id="44  031" >31</span>
 And the priests shall eat no bird or beast that dies of itself, or is taken of wild beasts.

<p><span class="chapter" id="45  001">45  </span> And when you° measure the land for inheritance, you° shall set apart first fruits to the Lord, a holy space of the land, in length twenty and five thousand   reeds  , and in breadth twenty thousand; it shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  002" id="45  002" >2</span>
 And there shall be a sanctuary out of this, five hundred   reeds in length   by five hundred in breadth, a square round about; and   there shall be   a vacant space   beyond   this of fifty cubits round about.  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  003" id="45  003" >3</span>
 And out of this measurement shall you measure the length five and twenty thousand, and the breadth twenty thousand: and in it shall be the holy of holies.  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  004" id="45  004" >4</span>
 Of the land shall be   a portion   for the priests that minister in the holy place, and it shall be for them that draw near to minister to the Lord: and it shall be to them a place for houses set apart for their sacred office;  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  005" id="45  005" >5</span>
 the length   shall be   twenty-five thousand, and the breadth twenty thousand: and the Levites that attend the house, they shall have cities to dwell in for a possession.  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  006" id="45  006" >6</span>
 And you° shall appoint   for   the possession of the city five thousand in breadth, and in length twenty-five thousand: after the manner of the first fruits of the holy portion, they shall be for all the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  007" id="45  007" >7</span>
 And the prince   shall have a portion   out of this, and out of this   there shall be a portion   for the first fruits of the sanctuary,   and   for the possession of the city, in front of the first fruits of the sanctuary, and in front of the possession of the city westward, and from the western parts eastward: and the length   shall be   equal to one of the parts of the western borders, and the length   shall be   to the eastern borders of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  008" id="45  008" >8</span>
 And he shall have it for a possession in Israel: and the princes of Israel shall no more oppress my people; but the house of Israel shall inherit the land according to their tribes.  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  009" id="45  009" >9</span>
 Thus says the Lord God; Let it suffice you, you° princes of Israel: remove injustice and misery, execute judgment and justice; take away oppression from my people, says the Lord God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  010" id="45  010" >10</span>
 You° shall have a just balance, and a just measure, and a just choenix for measure.  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  011" id="45  011" >11</span>
 And in like manner there shall be one choenix as a measure of capacity; the tenth of the homer   shall be   the choenix, and the tenth of the homer shall be in fair proportion to the homer.  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  012" id="45  012" >12</span>

 And one sheep from the flock out of ten, as an oblation from all the tribes of Israel, for sacrifices, and for whole burnt offerings, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for you, says the Lord God.  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  016" id="45  016" >16</span>
 And all the people shall give these first fruits to the prince of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  017" id="45  017" >17</span>
 And through the prince shall be   offered   the whole burnt offerings and the meat-offerings, and the drink-offerings in the feasts, and at the new moons, and on the sabbaths; and in all the feasts of the house of Israel: he shall offer the sin-offerings, and the meat-offering, and the whole burnt offerings, and the peace-offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  018" id="45  018" >18</span>
 Thus says the Lord God; In the first month, on the first   day   of the month, you° shall take a calf without blemish out of the herd, to make atonement for the holy place.  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  019" id="45  019" >19</span>
 And the priest shall take of the blood of the atonement, and put it on the thresholds of the house, and upon the four corners of the temple, and upon the altar, and upon the thresholds of the gate of the inner court.  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  020" id="45  020" >20</span>
 And thus shall you do in the seventh month; on the first   day   of the month you shall take a rate from each one; and you° shall make atonement for the house.  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  021" id="45  021" >21</span>
 And in the first   month  , on the fourteenth   day   of the month, you° shall have the feast of the passover; seven days shall you° eat unleavened bread.  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  022" id="45  022" >22</span>
 And the prince shall offer in that day a calf for a sin-offering for himself, and the house, and for all the people of the land.  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  023" id="45  023" >23</span>
 And for the seven days of the feast he shall offer as whole burnt offerings to the Lord seven calves and seven rams without blemish daily for the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin-offering, and a meat-offering.  <span class="verse" rel="v02645  024" id="45  024" >24</span>

 And in the seventh month, on the fifteenth   day   of the month, you shall sacrifice in the feast in the same way seven days, as   they sacrificed   the sin-offerings, and the whole burnt offerings, and the free will offering, and the oil.

<p><span class="chapter" id="46  001">46  </span> Thus says the Lord God; The gate that is in the inner court, that looks eastward, shall be shut the six working days;   but   let it be opened on the sabbath-day, and it shall be opened on the day of the new moon.  <span class="verse" rel="v02646  002" id="46  002" >2</span>
 And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the inner gate, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his whole burnt offerings and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship at the entrance of the gate: then shall he come forth; but the gate shall not be shut till evening.  <span class="verse" rel="v02646  003" id="46  003" >3</span>
 And the people of the land shall worship at the entrance of that gate, both on the sabbaths and at the new moons, before the Lord.  <span class="verse" rel="v02646  004" id="46  004" >4</span>

 And whenever the people of the land shall go in before the Lord at the feasts, he that goes in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate; and he that goes in by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the gate by which he entered, but he shall go forth opposite it.  <span class="verse" rel="v02646  010" id="46  010" >10</span>
 And the prince shall enter with them in the midst of them when they go in; and when they go forth, he shall go forth.  <span class="verse" rel="v02646  011" id="46  011" >11</span>
 And in the feasts and in the general assemblies the free will oblation shall be a meat-offering for the calf, and a meat-offering for the ram, and for the lambs, as his hand can furnish, and a hin of oil for the meat-offering.  <span class="verse" rel="v02646  012" id="46  012" >12</span>
 And if the prince should prepare   as   a thanksgiving a whole burnt-peace-offering to the Lord, and should open for himself the gate looking eastward, and offer his whole burnt offering, and his peace-offerings, as he does on the sabbath-day; then shall he go out, and shall shut the doors after he has gone out.  <span class="verse" rel="v02646  013" id="46  013" >13</span>

 But if he give a gift to one of his servants, then it shall belong to him until the year of release; and   then   he shall restore   it   to the prince: but of the inheritance of his sons   the possession   shall continue to them.  <span class="verse" rel="v02646  018" id="46  018" >18</span>

 And he brought me into the entrance of the   place   behind the gate, into the chamber of the sanctuary belonging to the priests, that looks toward the north: and, behold, there was a place set apart.  <span class="verse" rel="v02646  020" id="46  020" >20</span>
 And he said to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offerings and the sin-offerings, and there shall they bake the meat-offering always; so as not to carry   them   out into the outer court, to sanctify the people.  <span class="verse" rel="v02646  021" id="46  021" >21</span>
 And he brought me into the outer court, and led me round upon the four sides of the court; and, behold, there was a court on   each of   the sides of the court,  <span class="verse" rel="v02646  022" id="46  022" >22</span>
 on   every   side a court,   even   a court for all the four   sides  , and   each   little court belonging to the court was in length forty cubits, and   in   breadth thirty cubits,   there was   one measure to the four.  <span class="verse" rel="v02646  023" id="46  023" >23</span>

 And he brought me out by the way of the northern gate, and he led me round by the way outside to the gate of the court that looks eastward; and, behold, water came down from the right side,  <span class="verse" rel="v02647  003" id="47  003" >3</span>
 in   the direction   in which a man went forth opposite; and   there was   a measuring line in his hand, and he measured a thousand   cubits   with the measure;  <span class="verse" rel="v02647  004" id="47  004" >4</span>
 and he passed through the water;   it was   water of a fountain: and   again   he measured a thousand, and passed through the water; and the water was up to the thighs: and   again   he measured a thousand; and he passed through water up to the loins.  <span class="verse" rel="v02647  005" id="47  005" >5</span>

 And the eastern coasts between Loranitis, and Damascus, and the land of Galaad, and the land of Israel, the Jordan divides to the sea that is east of the city of palm-trees. These are the eastern   coasts  .  <span class="verse" rel="v02647  019" id="47  019" >19</span>
 And the southern and south-western   coasts are   from Thaeman and the city of palm-trees, to the water of Marimoth Cadem, reaching forth to the great sea. This part is the south and southwest.  <span class="verse" rel="v02647  020" id="47  020" >20</span>
 This part of the great sea forms a border, till   one comes   opposite the entrance of Emath,   even   as far as the entrance thereof. These are the parts west of Emath.  <span class="verse" rel="v02647  021" id="47  021" >21</span>
 So you° shall divide this land to them,   even   to the tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02647  022" id="47  022" >22</span>
 You° shall cast the lot upon it, for yourselves and the strangers that sojourn in the midst of you, who have begotten children in the midst of you: and they shall be to you as natives among the children of Israel; they shall eat with you in   their   inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" rel="v02647  023" id="47  023" >23</span>
 And they shall be in the tribe of proselytes among the proselytes that are with them: there shall you° give them an inheritance, says the Lord God.
